{"body": "It was a cold November in Chicago that year. I stumbled to my fridge after burrowing a path through the mountains of old food and dirty clothes. I stood there basking in the harsh light from the open door. I reach into the box of mountain dew game fuel. Empty. \"Fucking perfect\" I mumbled while fighting with the empty box that is now stuck on my arm. I rubbed my neck beard in frustration. I dread what this means. Being stuck in public with all the fucking moronic mouth breathers of the world, not the intellectual elite like me and the rest of my WoW and LoL clans. I grab my fedora off the coat rack and pull it down tight on my greasy hair. I get my trench coat from the closet. I notice that my favorite pony apple jack has hidden himself under my coat. \"I did nazi that coming!\" I yell at apple jack. He laughs and I pick him up twirling him through the air. I give him a kiss before I set out on the most noble of quests. After setting him back in the closet I grabbed my steel toe combat boots. Lacing them up like they do on CS:GO, I proceeded to put my zombie killing pocket knife, complete with window smasher and seatbelt cutter into the bottom pocket of my cargo shorts. Most people get cold legs, but not me, my genes have given me a healthy layer of insulation. All the sheeple say I need to loose weight but they don't know anything. I look in the mirror and get ready to set out on my quest. I'm looking good, 10/10 with rice. I trudge up the stairs out of my basement. Mom yells at me to not wear my boots in the house. What a fucking communist. I grab the keys for the Windstar, my noble steed, and head out the door, the wicked bitch barking questions at me about when I'll get a \"real\" job. I have tried to explain to her that real jobs are for sheeple, she's just not an intellectual like me though. I slam the door in defiance. I drive to the store while playing my music, flipping through my cellection of Frank Sinatra, Creed, and Cannibal Corpse CDs. I finally found my Queen Cd burried under the bags of chee wees, McDonald's, and empty cans of dew. I made it to the parking lot of Rolands gas station. I do all my shopping here because it isn't run by the oppresive communists at Wal-Mart. After filling my cart with the sweet nectar of the gods I grabbed some slim jims and cheetos. I placed my goods on the counter and itched my armpit, and then smelled it. The counter girl watched me and with a look of disgust, I laughed at her. She was maybe a solid 7/10 so I wasn't going to waste my time with this wench. I pulled my fedora lower to cover my eyes. The total came to $19.56. I pulled out my zelda chain wallet from my back pocket. It made a loud ripping noise as the Velcro seperated. The cashier now suddenly shifted her expression from disgust to lust after seeing the amount of cash I had, $230 in small bills that I got for my birthday 4 months ago. I gave her a 20 winked, tipped my fedora, and smiled as I told her to keep the change, you could almost hear the panties dropping. I don't fuck anything under a nine though. She is just a whore who is after my money. I drive back home and return to the musty, damp basement. I fire up my custom gaming rig and pick some crumbs off the keyboard. I open reddit with a speed that can only be described as blinding. Few people can type 45 words per minute like me. I go over my replies and begin the daily task of downvoting sheeple who can't see the real truth like I can. I lean back and take a gulp of dew as I hit enter on a reply to a guy who says religion isn't bad. What a sheep. I then go to gonewild and tell all the women there that it is gross that they have small tits and wierd nipples and I would never fuck them.

{"body": "PhD Candidate in Molecular Biology here:\n\n- The calories determined on the side of your food are determined by tests like calorimetry where they literally burn the food/substance in a very precise manner (they know how much energy they put in) and see how much excess energy is released. So calories are based off of the assumption of 100% absorption.\n\n- The body is pretty damn good at what it does, so most of the time, if you're healthy, you'll be at or near 100% absorption. For instance, I have Crohn's, so if I get a flare up I can expect my damaged ulcerated and inflammed GI tract to be pretty inefficient. Another more common example would be a bad gallbladder, which would make you very inefficient at digesting fats (you would have runny burning greasy shits and probably immense pain in your chest/shoulder blade). Another example might be runner's shits, which is like the compounding interest of the diet world (it's a real thing). But for most healthy humans, you can conservatively assume that your body digests a very significant portion of the food. There is undoubtedly variation amongst healthy people. I don't have a source for you, but from my general experience I would estimate it at plus or minus a pop tart.\n\n- Shit is not *completely* calorie free. Bugs eat that shit, because there's still a very small amount of undigested food substances in there. Also, shit is ~2/3 dead bacteria, so that's \"calories\" as well. 0/10, would not recommend if stranded on an island. 2/10 with rice.\n\nTL;DR These humans with inefficient GI tracts are usually pretty noticeably diseased (i.e. painful inflammation of the GI tract, chronic diarrhea, etc.). Undigested food + osmotic effect in colon = diarrhea. The variation from healthy person to healthy person is pretty small and nearly negligible. I'd say well within error of how well most humans are at counting calories, anyway.  +/- a pop tart.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425399846", "subreddit": "fatpeoplehate", "score": 33, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Each of the parts has slightly different origins:\n\n##360 quickscope##\n\nQuickscoping is a tactic used in shooters where you zoom in with a sniper rifle but shoot before the graphics actually show where you are zoomed. Certain games gave you an accuracy boost as soon as you started the zoom regardless of when the animation actually showed you zoomed in. Extremely fast quickscopes just look like you shooting the gun without scoping at all.\n\nThe 360 part comes from people turning their aiming sensitivity up and spinning around in a circle before shooting. It is just trick shooting in video games.\n\n##8##\n\nThere are a series of words that people like to chain together that all contain an \"8\" sound in them:\n\n&gt; gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8\n\nIt's a very specific variation on [textese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language) that intentionally takes it as far as it can be taken. Now it is mostly used as another way to say \"cool story bro\".\n\nEDIT: /u/E-Squid [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2y8hkr/what_is_the_origin_of_the_m8_gr8_360_quickscope/cp7jubk) that the \"b8\" chunk was especially popular on 4chan in case you were curious about that particular one.\n\n##MLG##\n\nMLG is Major League Gaming which is one of the larger eSports leagues. People like to claim they are MLG players because they think it gives them some sort of credibility.\n\n##Yolo / Swag##\n\nYOLO is You Only Live Once and it was a big tag on social media sites for awhile. Swag somehow became associated with it and now you see yoloswag. EDIT: /u/DarkDubzs [has a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2y8hkr/what_is_the_origin_of_the_m8_gr8_360_quickscope/cp7y8yt) for where the swag part came from:\n\n&gt; People who usually said Yolo or supposedly lived by it dressed and acted with \"swag\" with brands like Obey and other street/urban wear, flashy clothing, big shoes, accessories, etc, and one main thing... snapbacks, they were everywhere. It looked ridiculous and soon became a trend, then was ridiculed and anything associated with Yolo swag.\n\n##420 blaze it##\n\nBoth 420 and \"blaze it\" are references to smoking weed. A lot of kids who posted videos showing off their self-proclaimed MLG level skillz had names like \"XXX420blazeitXXX\" and it became a quick target when the parodies starting showing up.\n\n##Illuminati Confirmed##\n\nThe Illuminati is just a classic conspiracy theory and it gets trotted out whenever people are making fun of conspiracy theorists. Illuminati Confirmed references a specific group of parodies of the issue.\n\n##Altogether##\n\nSo the reason you might see all of these near each other now is that people are chaining jokes that were only somewhat related as a meta-joke on the whole subject. There is no particular reason this group of jokes is seen together other than:\n\n* Many of them are related to parodies of the ridiculous montages popular from shooters (specifically, 360, quickscope, MLG, 420 blaze it)\n* Most of them are poking fun at people who think they are better or more intelligent than average (specifically, m8/gr8, 360, quickscope, MLG, swag, Illuminati Confirmed)\n* Someone once chained them first and it grew as its own meme\n\nHope that helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425744500", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "score": 400, "controversiality": 0}

The song feels very repetitive.\n\nCompared to The 2nd Law, I would put it below Survival, Supremacy, Animals, and Panic Station. Above everything else though. Weird song to display first. \n\nedit: I'm just excited for more falsetto \n\nedit^2: I meant weird song to display first because I think it is the *least* shocking pre-single they have released in my opinion. And as the hours have passed (and I listened to it 22 more times), I think it is comparable quality to Supremacy. Gotta let that hype finish fluctuating though. I downloaded the non-sergeant version and it makes me like the song *so* much more. And the repetitive-ness is less bad than I expected. \n\nBut, lyrics are still garbage. Don't really care though, ignoring them is easy. I still think it sounds unfinished, like they forgot to do something. Its like they forgot how to make a raw sound, so they just make it sound half done.

I like the juxtaposition of the typical somber and depressive lyrics with the playful yet hard OF lines, i really do.

{"body": "My first real apartment was a fucking shitstorm of weird. Not all bad, but weird. \n\nROOMMATE 1: Had anger management issues, but downplayed how serious they were. He and I planned to talk to ROOMMATE 2 about his hygiene issues, and I took a nap waiting for 1 to come back from work. Woke up to the sound of screaming and breaking glass, 1 yelling the most horrible things at 2, 2 sounding confused as hell. After that night he ran away, broke his lease, and only came back once to grab some of his shit. Left a bunch that I wound up selling to make rent, since he didn't pay his rent for that month, either.\n\nROOMMATE 2: This one was unfortunate. He was a pretty withdrawn person in general, and we didn't find this out until months after all of this, but an aunt he was very close to died suddenly near the beginning of the school year. He became deeply depressed, and rarely left his room. The smell was astounding, and was what drove ROOMMATE 1 to such extreme retaliation. Eventually, 2 just sort of disappeared. We needed another roommate, so ROOMMATE 4 and I had to clean it. The carpet was coated - *actually coated* with an inch-thick layer of sunflower seed hulls. There were piles of old school papers and trash in every corner of the room. His bare mattress was still moist from sweat after a month by itself, and black mold was growing on the bottom. ROOMMATE 4 and I wound up having to buy arm-length gloves, aprons, and face-masks to clean the place, and had a fistfight over who got to use the shower first when we finished.\n\nROOMMATE 3: This guy was just weird. He could NOT sleep in a bed. Refused to buy a mattress, just slept either on his floor in a pile of dirty laundry or on the couch. Ate nothing but ramen and Vienna sausages, and smelled like them. Disappeared for two months, found out he'd met a girl and stayed over at her place, and just decided to keep staying over, without it ever occurring to him that maybe he should tell his roommates about it.\n\nROOMMATE 4: This guy was originally intended to replace ROOMMATE 1. I knew him vaguely from online stuff and mutual friends, and he was looking to get out of the Deep South, so I invited him to stay in the spare room and he got a plane ticket and headed up. His hair had grown past his waist, and honestly made his 6'5 self look like Bigfoot. He spent all his time playing World of Warcraft, or watching YouTube-poops and laughing like a maniac. Once came home high on mushrooms, and stood in my doorway while I was focused on a computer game, watching me silently for at least ten minutes before he just started screaming. I had no idea what was wrong with him, and was trying to figure out what he was on. He ate my feather collection, vomited all over himself, and then began undressing. That's when I went into my room, locked my door, and tried my hardest to sleep while I heard him thrashing around and screaming in the living room. The next morning, I found him just in his underwear. I gave him a glass of water, helped him into the shower, and managed to get him headed to work. He was actually the best roommate out of the four. 8/10, 10/10 with rice, would room again, he and I are still good friends.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426331905", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I loved the area you could explore, I loved the survivalist's backstory and all the cool gear you got from him, especially his combat armor. Because it looks like NCR combat ranger armor but I don't have to deal with the stupid faction thing. I actually liked the .45 auto pistol, I think it's cool because it looks like an actual normal handgun and is better than the other normal looking gun, the 9mm one. When I ran through as a unarmed guy, the bear gauntlets were great. The story is alright and the resources everywhere helped me out so much. I am big on the survival trait, it's one of my favorites so being able to make the recipes cuz I could actually get the ingredients was great. \n\nSo all in all I give it 9/10. 11/10 with rice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426454336", "subreddit": "casualiama", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

You then start to panic, thinking he will hit you again, so you right click and defensively raise your sword up for the parry, the vanguard knows this, and after he stabbed, he combos into a dragged overhead - he looks as far up as he can, and overheads, and what this does is ensure that the tail-end of the strike hits you just after your parry has expired and you go into recovery.\n\n\nSo, it's not nonsense. It's a series of well-executed mind-games, precision and skill, and is the reason why this game is still alive, a buggy fucking mess, years later.

I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10. 10/10 with rice xd, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS. ...this kills the redditor.\n\nOP will surely deliver. op pls, pls op pls respond that link is staying blue.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll show myself out.\n\nDirected by M. Night Shamallama.\n\nAs long as the 'fad' for plagiarising other peoples' witty comments doesn't die out, I guess I'm cool.\n\n*edit: I accidentally a word\n\nthis community is fucking shit, every comment section of every top post has some variation of this garbage re-iterated as the top comment. and you unoriginal idiots upvote it like it's the punniest thing you have ever seen. low effort jokes all day long.\n\nedit: LOL THX FRONT PAGE POST OBLIGATORY XDDDDD\n\nactual edit: removed thanks for the gold.\n\nDank memes", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426626210", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
