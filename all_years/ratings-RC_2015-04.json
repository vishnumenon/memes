{"body": "The story began last weekend.\n\nI'm not a HUGE fan of Mickey D, but I have to admit that the Jalapeno (I always make an effort to forcefully pronounce the \"J\") Double is actually pretty dang good. I walked in and saw that one of my friends was working the counter, so I decided to mess with him a bit.\n\nI've always been interested in knowing just how large of a sandwich McDonalds would serve, so I asked for a **J**alapeno Quadruple. I didn't actually want the sandwich, I just wanted to know how much it would cost.\n\nMy friend, I should note, is Mexican (this comes into play later). He couldn't figure out how to add the two extra patties, so he went to ask his manager about it. He walked up to her, and inquired about sprucing up this **J**alapeno (he forwent his Mexican instincts and said it the way that I always do) Double.\n\nHe came back so embarrassed that he forced me to order the Jalapeno Quadruple. He was seriously worried (probably frivolously) that he would be fired. As much as I didn't want the burger, I have to admit that I ended up eating the whole thing.\n\n5/10\n\n4/10 with rice would not Jalapeno again.\n\n[Pic for proof](http://i.imgur.com/lqpCaT0.jpg)\n\nEdit: I know the pic looks like it only has 3 patties.

I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once.

This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

I even was looking through old HS yearbooks and someone commented on it when they signed my yearbook! And then I got one a couple of years out of college. I'm extremely sad to report that some of the magic has worn off. In a good and a bad way...\n\nI've learned that sometimes ultimate speed is not the most fun. It's an extremely common misconception that speed and power automatically = **FUN**. And that's definitely true to an extent. But, woe is me, when my internal speed racer is itching for a hit, I can't really satisfy it with the Viper before my internal \"oh shit I can go straight to jail at these speeds\" voice chimes in. First gear goes to 60 in the blink of an eye. I think 120 or 130 in third. So what I really want to do, what I crave to do, is blast down a back road, wide open throttle. And then I do. But half way down the road I've doubled the speed limit and it's getting irresponsible. So I shut it down and use the rest of the back road to coast down to the speed limit. The analogy is basically premature ejaculation. At the end of it all you’re left thinking that wasn’t entirely as satisfying as you hoped and you wish you could enjoy it more. I'm left going, OK... Now what? It's a similar syndrome for the corners, because the Viper has *so much* capability that testing it on the street is pretty irresponsible because if something goes wrong, it will go wrong in a big way. I don't think the Viper is as scary as the magazines make it out to be, it doesn't behave as if it has a mind of its own, it is predictable. But, it's so, so capable and once you pass those capabilities due to your own error you won't just slide off into the gravel on the shoulder, you'll slide into the next state over. \n\nSo I've gained an appreciation for slow cars having owned the Viper. Sounds strange but true. And going slow in a Viper is a total tease. \n\nI also don't see it on as much of a pedestal. I don't see almost any car up on a pedestal anymore, except some of the really rare stuff. The Viper has given me access to see so many other supercars (strange how that works), often enough that during one particular day I saw a lambo on the highway and didn't really react because I just got back from a Cars and Coffee and a Ferrari and McLaren dealer with my friends in an Exige, Elise, M3 and Corvette. Because it IS just a car - they all are just (really cool, great, excellent) machines. My Viper needs maintenance just like any other car, and it's controls are just like any other manual car, and if you wreck it you’ll need to fix it just like any other car (except you’ll also have to pay the Viper tax = $$$$$).\n\nIn the beginning of ownership, I almost had a heart attack when I let my father drive it and I am ashamed of that - he is a huge part of the reason I even have a Viper because he taught me about cars. And I didn't even want to let him drive it because I was too paranoid. How terrible, to have this and not share it? That paranoia has worn off, thankfully, and now I'm glad to be free of that burden, because that is what putting a car on a pedestal really is: a burden. It then becomes something you have to protect, and how can you really enjoy something if you're constantly reminded that it's risky, or that you might incur damage?  It already has rock chips on it and some squeaks, and I felt like *I* was not a good owner for having a less-than-mint Viper. But now that I see it as less of a dream and more of a real car that I can use, I am getting adjusted to the fact that this isn’t the best Viper out there and that’s a good thing because I can use it, depreciate it, and feel less guilt. \n\nI’ve never tracked it, but absolutely will this year. I am really looking forwards to that, to see if it changes my appreciation for the car. I hope I can finally feed my speed demon.\n\nSo, **TL:DR:** It's better because I’ve realized it’s just a car and I am not afraid to use it &amp; share it with other gear heads. It’s worse because now the dream is real so by definition, it’s no longer a dream car. \n\nAll in all, 10/10 would do again. 11/10 with rice, snakes love rice. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428416662", "subreddit": "cars", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": " * before any comments, I'd like to share this [tweet](https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/587980415350112256). \n\n * Apparently subin wrote all the songs which was really impressive, she's a 94-liner too\n\n * I like To Darling but I think it could have been better if it was less hectic. It's a really sweet and chill song, I think it would have been better if they made it a bit simpler and cut down a bit on the drums actually. Wonder how it'd sound with just a bit of acoustic guitar/piano\n\n * I think Joker is an alright song. It's consistent in it's tone but the concept, dance and the melody just don't stand out to me. A bit disappointing.\n \n * 홀려 was my favorite song. It was a little funky which I liked. This album just doesn't stand out to me much and while that may be something to criticize, others may like their style. 홀려 in particular had a bit of a jazzy feel to it. I think Dal Shabet has sleeper talent, like good looks, talented artists, and decent singers but they don't showcase it well. For example, I wish they went further with the concept of their songs and experimented more, like making 홀려 even more jazzy/funky.

Nice conditioner! Just male sure to keep it away from anything but your pubes.\n\n4) Shave WITH the grind.\n\n5) You can't afford a waxing AND are afraid to shave? Buy Nair, if you don't have sensitive skin.\n\nEdit:\n\nI just tried coconut oil, shaving with the grain. My vagina feels like Varys the Spider's forehead, but still has stubble.

Instead of \"legs,\" the UT-AT featured 16 low-power repulsorlift skis that would shift to properly balance the vehicle depending on the terrain. Four additional repulsorlift plates were located under the main carriage for propulsion. The skis also had the ability to reverse their repulsion, causing gription fields and allowing the vehicle to ascend sheer surfaces if needed. The skis supplied superior stability when firing, and were particularly effective on unstable terrain.  \n&gt;Although the skis canceled out the weight of the vehicle, it was still difficult to maneuver due to its significant inertial mass. This limited the recommended speed of the craft to 45 kilometers per hour. The skis were blast-proof, which made them invulnerable to light blaster fire, but not to explosive charges. A significant amount of heat was generated by the undulating plates, which was compensated for by an air vent located towards the front of the vehicle.  \n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/GDqGyr8.png) [^(i)](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140430180744/starwars/images/8/8d/Eras-legends.png)\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/u3oMmrr.jpg) [^(i)](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100818194356/starwars/images/0/0d/UT-AT_sides.jpg)\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/7EdkeV5.jpg) [^(i)](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090124014414/starwars/images/f/f7/Ventress_vs_UT-AT.jpg)\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/NNebgU6.jpg) [^(i)](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130215051632/starwars/images/1/17/UTAT_Mygeeto.png)\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/75KU9z1.jpg) [^(i)](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100818192932/starwars/images/2/21/UT-AT.jpg)\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/xSmhiEn.jpg) [^(i)](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080121061130/starwars/images/3/36/UTAT.jpg)\n&gt;^Interesting: [^All ^Terrain ^Armored ^Transport](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Armored Transport) ^| [^All ^Terrain ^Scout ^Transport](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Scout Transport) ^| [^All ^Terrain ^Experimental ^Transport](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Experimental Transport) ^| [^All ^Terrain ^Scout ^Transport/Assault](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Scout Transport/Assault) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqigsp1) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqigsp1)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikiabot/wiki/index) ^|  [^Source](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py)\n ^(Please note this bot is in testing.

He walked up to the flower and stared when suddenly the flower caught on fire. The man ran for a bucket of water but it was to late.

{"body": "I'm 17, been playing games as long as I can remember. I thoroughly enjoyed the last MK, the gore didn't bother me at all- it wouldn't be MK without it. MKX... it's like they're trying too hard. They used to make them as over the top and ridiculous as possible, but it seems like they're moving towards just making them as gory as they can. Just look at the examples someone posted above:\n\n&gt;Bubble Head: Cassie draws her pistol and shoots her opponent's kneecaps, forcing them down onto their knees, then shoots them in the head. As her opponent's reels and blood spills from their head wound, Cassie walks up to them, pops her gum, then sticks the wad onto the bullet hole in their head, with blood filling the gum up into a balloon, and then pops, splattering blood on their face before they collapse dead. (MKX)\n\nNothing to write home about but I'd consider it a pretty good fatality. Could be better, 7/10 with rice.\n\n&gt;Selfie: Cassie draws her nightstick and hits her opponent's jaw with enough force to break it and leave it dangling from one side. As her victim starts to fall, Cassie grabs her opponent, pulls out her mobile phone and takes a picture of herself and her jaw-broken victim together in a \"selfie.\" She sends the photo to a social media site called \"Friendships\" where other users are seen commenting on it (some of whom appear to be other Mortal Kombat X characters; different comments appear every time). (MKX)\n\nWtf is this? Honestly? She just arbitrarily breaks the dudes jaw because hey, that'll look shocking, and takes a picture with him? The comments are kinda funny but other than that it's an awful excuse for a fatality.\n\nI think they're trying to be as edgy as possible because they know that controversy sells, and that nobody relevant is going to review a goddamn Mortal Kombat game and say it's too gory, because that reviewer would be laughed at.\n\nThat said, the game is fun as fuck, I just hope the next one focuses more on what MK has always been- a good fighting game laden with ridiculous, over the top gore- rather than a good fighting game with gore.

{"body": "I understand about the LKQ, it's basically the main gripe people have when they have an insurance claim. A lot of people don't take the time to read and understand what type of insurance they're paying for when they get an auto policy.  Here's the thing, no insurance company will ever put OEM parts on a vehicle that's not less than a year old (sometimes 2) or has less than 15k miles.  If your car ain't new, why does it get new parts?  The only exception is if that insured specifically purchased an OEM endorsement on their insurance policy, which is available at most standard insurance companies.  Safe Auto and The General, Non-Standard companies, won't offer this endorsement, but all the big ones typically do.  Also, adding to the LKQ argument, there's a LKQ plant in Columbus and they do a damn fine job.  They would be out of a job quickly if they sold crappy parts to insurance companies.  If you are unfortunate enough to have an insurance claim, look closely at the estimate that's written.  Those LKQ parts are lifetime guaranteed the majority of the time.\n\nI worked as an insurance adjuster for a few years at two different insurance companies in Columbus and have had both good and bad experiences with 3C.  They have a few bad practices where it felt like they were money grabbing from the insurance company.  Mainly the LKQ part you bring up, which 90% of the time the insurance company still won't pay for and it's on the customer/insured to cover the difference.  Never dealt with the Bob character, but there were a few decent people I've worked with there - the receptionist not being one of them - but ultimately i felt like they hindered the claim, and the relationship between the Insurer (there to help no matter what you may think) and the Insured.  Mainly, by telling the Insured how an insurance claim works, building false pretenses, when the Insurer is telling the customer how the process really works and the fastest scenario to get you paid and your car on the road.  Insurance companies lose money the longer claims are kept open.  They were by far, in all of the body shops in all of the states I've worked with, the most difficult body shop to deal with.

{"body": "Not Philippines, but china. You might still be interested in a read.\n\nAfter my parents divorce, my dad had a mail order bride from china. Half his age and very pretty. I was 16 or so at the time. Lets just start off saying it takes a lot of paperwork and documentation to get someone in the country. They talked online for about 6 months before she moved over. My dad visited china first and i think they actually got married there. It's really unclear. Now for the interesting part. She arrives.\n\nMy dad has an alcohol collection and was showing her some of it. He turns his back to get something else in the kitchen and she pours a 8oz glass and downs it. She wound up saying she loved everyone, especially our hair. She was fascinated with American hair that night... until the second wave of drunkenness set in where she was crying and screaminf saying my  dad loved my mother and my mother was prettier than her. Good first impression. My mom caught word od this incident and said she was uncomfortable with her kids being around that behavior. My step mother was banned from alcohol. \n\nMy father also had a long time friend, Norm, who resided in china (black man with a lovely chinese wife). They homestayed at my house for a good 3 months, and during the process, Norm's wife made us meals as a thank you for hospitality. She made the best damn breakfast ever. They slept in the trailer we had, so they had their privacy in that aspect. I respected Norm a lot. He helped out wherever he could and had a great positive outlook in life. Eventually, my fathers wife got jealous and started hiding things around the house saying that Norm was stealing. Against my and my siblings protests, he believed her. Eventually he confronted Norm, and Norms response was \"I think its time for me to leave.\" Ive never seen him since.\n\nLife continued as normal, and eventually, we were looking through some high cupboards and found one of the \"stolen\" items conveniently wrapped up in a paper towel. Even though my dad never admitted to being wrong, i think this was the turning point. One night, my dad's wife let out a shriek in the middle of the night (from the living room). This woke me up to my dad saying \"Julie! You cant yell like that in the night. People are sleeping!\" I tried to get back to sleep, and about 10 mins later i saw police lights. Apparenlty she took off into the street with a knife and my dad called the cops on her. We were henceforth banned from going to my dads house for as long as Julie was there.\n\nNow comes for the divorce. Julie started trying to claim abuse and whatnot, including trying to say that I was responsible for an old injury in her knee. The doctor said the force required to do that damage was that of a nfl linebacker tackling her... i was a 115 pound boy. Not quite NFL status. Still. Domestic abuse charges are hard to fight against. But my dad had a keylogger on his computer which caught Julie asking a friend in an email \"how to get a green card exemption by filing for abuse.\" The judge threw out that case. Still my dad had to prove marriage fraud separately which is hard to do, given how hard it is to get someone in the country to begin with. Eventually my dad had to make $700 rent payments for Julie for 3 years or something. It was hard on us as a family and we almost lost our house.\n\nNot a pleasant experience 3/10 would not do again. 5/10 with rice.\n\nTl;dr: she went from 0 to 8oz real quick, framed a black man for stealing, took off into the street with a knife, turned me into a NFL superstar, and pissed off a judge with an email... and still managed to get her way.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429972923", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 175, "controversiality": 0}

You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle.\n\n\nEdit: This blew up.

{"body": "Hullo chaps!  \nSaturday was the day of my little brother's confirmation, so of course I decided to go out drinking with my mate once the party had ended. As usual we went to Highlanders Bar (great place w/ 150 whiskies and 60+ beers). My mate was paying the first round, so I decided that we were having BenRiach Solstice. Also, I know the bartender, so we got double pours. Or, well, bigger pours than the other customers. Perhaps it was because we were suited up, but whatever.  \nI have been keen on trying this for a while, so I had high expectations for it! Here's what I got. Skål!\n\n#BenRiach Solstice, 17 y/o, 50% abv, NCA+NCF - 2nd Edition#\n_____  \n**Colour:**  \n*I usually don't include colour, mainly because I don't give a shit (except for Dalmore; fuck those guys), but this was absolutely gorgeous! I'm sure that IGN would r8 it 8/8 m8.* \n\n**Nose:**  \n*Port, peat, smokey wood, red grapes, ripe red plum, berries, thick jam.*  \nWow, quite fruity and thick. I was already a bit tipsy (blame it on martinis) and it was in a bar, so I feel like I didn't get the full experience. Still good. \n\n**Taste:**  \n*Plums, port, peat, salt, malt, strawberries - the artificial kind, vegetal and earthy.*  \nIt has a rather nice, oily mouthfeel, and it is very gentle for being 50% alcohol. Yummy! \n\n**Finnish?:**  \n*No I'm Danish. Joking aside, peaty and salty leaving a bit of the strawberry jam.*  \nThe finish is where the peat really shines. It's not the ravaging peat of Laphroaig, nor is it the bonfire of Lagavulin. It's more like a combination of the salty peat of Talisker and the sharpness of Ardmore. Not that long of a finish, though. This is what disappointed me. \n_____\nIt's a damn good whisky. There's something about the finish, though, but I still love it. I'm gonna give it \n#92/100#\n___\n**Postscript:**\n\nSo, my mate and I met with a couple of my \"high-roller, big-spender\" type friends after finishing our Bennies. Now, I have a rep on the high-school for being that guy with the scotch. So naturally, I wanted scotch. I spotted some Laphroaig QC, and ordered two pours in cognac glasses. The price was about $10 for 2cl, but it was a good place, and not too bad compared to the usual prices. Welp, this bartender girl had no concept of 2cl, so she poured about 6cl. Nice!  \nI immediately saw the potential in this, so after finishing the froggy, I ordered a dram of the HP21 that was hiding on the shelf.
