{"body": "This is really, really good so these are all little niggles, but on the whole fantastic job!\n\nIt's nice that you varied on i - VI - iv - V, but I think you could maybe vary it a bit more in the bit where the bassline is really prominent? It's the simplest part of your track and it's kind of unnerving how pop it is in contrast to the (excellently jazzy and awesomely counter-intuitive) rest. Vocals are cool, samples work really well to loosen the whole thing up, production is tight (though maybe the kick a bit loud? It's not my favourite kick in the world but if that's what you're going for, go for it!). \n\nAlso, the bit where your pitched-up vocal is paralleling your main one - could maybe make it a bit more the way it happens [in James Blake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBcCXX0aWhc) or in [Mumdance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaG2RyDxQlk)? I.e. crisp, pitched-down, rather than hazy and in the background. It'd maybe make the vocal a bit more alien which I'd see working well, but yeah, it works really well already and it's up to you :)\n\ni r8 8/8 gr8 b8 m8 no h8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430674569", "subreddit": "futurebeatproducers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No, I stopped going; simply out-grew it, and even if I didn't the $117 price tag for a table spot simply isn't worth it because you'll get just that - a measly table spot. If you plan on eating on site you're looking at $5 for [one of those shitty pizzas I mentioned earlier](http://www.laurenbkirchner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1010923.jpg), and with the sleeping halls usually being occupied you'll have to sleep at your computer which is not only uncomfortable (you're not allowed to sleep under the table, even though it's your fucking spot you paid over $100 for) but also close to impossible since they blast loud EDM music during the whole event. *\"But... what makes it worth?\"*, you may ask. *\"Surely the gaming aspect is an up-side, since it's essentially a huge gaming convention?\"* Well, yes and no. \n\nThe live artist performances are great, but they're located in the biggest hall of them all - [D hallen](http://www.techsweden.org/forum/uploads/monthly_06_2013/ccs-17481-0-55429800-1371310189.jpg) - and it's extremely hard to get a good main-stage spot unless you actually pay for a seat in the same hall. If you do chose to sit in D-hallen, however, people will bump into the back on your chair *all the fucking time* because it's always crowded, which not only makes gaming sessions extremely unenjoyable but also pisses you off to a point where you'll almost pop an artery. The other halls are pretty good if you actually plan on playing games without having your focus interrupted every few minutes, but then you'll run into the issue I mentioned earlier - not getting a descent spot for the artist performances, which really is a huge downside. \n\nThe tournaments held are presumably good, since you'll have to fork over *even more* dollaridoos if you want to attend them. The exhibition halls, on the other hand, are excellent and executed perfectly - hands-on play with soon-to-be released games, meeting many gaming e-celebrities you have a hard-on for, and loads of free swag. Sadly one trip to the exhibition halls are usually enough to satisfy your needs since you can cover it all in one day.\n\nDreamHack gets my rating of: **2/10**, and **-9000/10 with rice** because it probably would be overpriced and taste like ass. The rating would rise to **3/10** if I didn't, during my last visit, got seated next to an obese neckbeard who not only occupied his spot, but also half of mine.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430806552", "subreddit": "justneckbeardthings", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is what Anti-GamerGate actually believes. That's amazing. How much koolaid has Kameron Hurley been drinking?\n\nThey genuinely see GG as a group of 300 white, heterosexual, male, doxxing, raping, bro-fisting, backwards-hatted, woman-hating, slaving, poor-hating, gay-bashers.\n\nBut since nothing about transphobia was mentioned, as is required by The Narrative against GamerGate, I have no choice but to wonder if Kameron sympathizes with the transphobic. ^/s\n\nChoice passages:\n\n&gt;“Democracy? A few hundred people create dummy accounts and thousands of fake digital IDs, blowing themselves up like pufferfish to look larger than they are...” \n\n'GamerGate is 300 people!'\n\n&gt;Sorva held her tongue. She had once watched a colleague of hers, a female developer, stripped bare by her male colleagues and doused with a keg of beer. \n\nWe'd all be sex offenders, oh, if only we had the chance!\n\n&gt;In addition to married households consisting of one man, one woman, up to three mistresses, and six children, it is also permissible to include families with just four children now. Very generous, that change.\n\nWe're apparently for... polygamy? What? Someone's pet issues are showing. How precious.\n\n&gt;You are absolutely free to write about whatever religion you’d like. There are a half dozen Christian denominations that are CEO-approved.\n\nWe're Christians, too? Since when has GG ever had an interest in Christianity? If anything most people here overlap with the atheists who fought off Atheism+.\n\n&gt;“Yet this is the fourth year you’ve submitted ineligible work,” Marken said. “Are you stupid? Were your parents poor or gay or something?”\n\nThat's funny, it always looks like the prominent Anti-GG people are the ones who come from lives of privilege and wealth, typically cliquing it up in San Francisco. But yeah, we're rollin' in fat stacks of cash.\n\nThey've successively Otherized GamerGate by every single metric they could, applying everything they dislike to it to the point of absurdity. Anti-GG really are fighting their own imaginary monsters.\n\nI legitimately hope this story is gr8 b8, if so I rate 8/8. If it's a serious satire of GamerGate, I rate 'seek medication for your delusions'.\n\n**EDIT** Before anyone claims this is some Pro-GG satire or just a troll fanfic, this is a Hugo winner. The author is this person. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kameron_Hurley\n\nThe story is hosted on Vice Motherboard.\n\nThey're legitimately Anti-GG and believe this is a proper 'satire' of what GG wants. https://archive.is/HGeud\n\nAnd oh my god they're actually from *San Francisco!* Clique levels at maximum! My siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiides, awaaaay!\n\n**EDIT 2 Can someone do a dramatic reading of this story and put it up on youtube please?

{"body": "Norton had no idea what was coming. He had kept his mousing fingers on the pulse of what was going on outside but still didn't have the nerve to cross his threshold. All his life, all that had ever come from going out there was pain and mental anguish. Bullies, unsympathetic catcalls from the popular crowd, up-turned lunch trays and wedgies; always the wedgies... Life wasn't particularly easy when you were 168cm tall (5' 6\" to the Imperial heathens!), built like you were made out of toothpicks, and could mentally out-wrestle anyone in the room. The world outside was not a world for him.  \nIt was a day he would never forget. About two months after the virus had taken its toll, he was posting on his favourite forum, completely unaware of the large vehicles rolling up outside of his house. He had just hit \"save\" when the front door splintered in. He let out a high-pitched squeal as he turned to see a squad of soldiers come rushing in. He put up his hands, half in surrender, half for protection (whatever measure they would do...) before opening his eyes and turning to take a second look.  \nThey were all women. Every. Single. One of them. They didn't look like bombshells or the girls he would never admit to looking at on the internet. They all scanned the room, pointing their weapons to the corners, one covering their entrance.  \n\"Clear!\" One shouted and got a chorus of 'clears' in return. The leader then approached him with a confident gait. She had the stride typical of the bullies in school. Confident, collected, prone to violence. Norton recoiled and tucked himself into a half-ball in his rolling chair, preparing himself for the blow.  \n\"Norton Nathaniel Theodore Virous?\" she stated, stopped a half-step away from him. Norton opened his eyes and lowered his arms.  \n\"Y-yes?\"  \n\"Package secured. Prep for transport,\" the leader spat into her radio and set her team into motion. The sound of rotors started to become clear outside. \"Sir,\" she stated, looking him up and down, \"you're going to have to come with me.\" She took him by the hand and mostly dragged him through the hole they had made to get to him. A chopper was already on the lawn, befuddling the remaining neighbours. She shoved him into the back of the helo, boarded it herself and slammed the door closed. As they lifted off, Norton finally got enough gumption to speak.  \n\"Where are we going?\" He couldn't even make eye contact with the squad leader across from him.  \n\"Classified. All you need to know is you have been brought under the protection of the United States government as part of Project Easter.\" She took her helmet off and Norton finally got a clear look at her. An honest 8/10, 9/10 with rice.  \n\"Project Easter?\"  \n\"Government project to start repopulating the country. And boy,\" she started to take her uniform off, \"We're going to fuck like rabbits.\"  \n______________  \n  \n*Norton, no one is ever going to believe that.*  \n*Shut up, it's my story.

{"body": "I've had it for about a week. I tech my own guns and my squad's stuff, so I've been inside a gearbox or two. ICS's piston seems to be made out of the same sort of POM material as the lonex upgrade pistons I typically put in guns aftermarket. Teeth are half metal, instead of just the release tooth. I like that. The other, non-proline ICS guns don't come with this piston. Gears are quiet, indicates a good factory shim job. Rotary hop up unit moves smoothly and has some resistance to it, but not an unnecessary amount. Should prevent hop from coming loose. Hop up unit is also metal, not plastic. The rear wiring setup is very nice, comes with an automotive blade fuse and the wires are routed underneath the buffer tube to give you max battery space. In the crane stock variant, you can easily fit either a large 11.1 or multiple smaller 11.1's in parallel. Mine chronos very consistently at 355 with .28's, math says that's roughly 370 with .25's. Fire rate isn't amazing, but isn't slouchy either.\n\nExternally the gun rates 10/10. It is built like a fucking brick. The receivers are very beefy, lots of extra metal all over to match the real steel PAR series. Makes the airsoft version very satisfying to hold. The gun is also made out of CNC'd aluminum vs the crappy pot metal of most metal AEG's. The pistol grip is very comfy.\n\nOverall, I r8 8/8.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430958782", "subreddit": "airsoft", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Granted, it's not going to give you insta-cancer, but it isn't *good* for you and I would not recommend it as part of your morning routine. \n\nThe x-ray machine you go thru at an airport uses supper low quantities of radiation as it's only made to go thru clothes and maybe a bit of your skin. Baggage x-ray machines are made to penetrate most metals to some degree, so the dosage is much higher. The worst x-ray machines are the ones your checked baggage goes thru. They use a metric fuckton of radiation in comparison as they are designed to process baggage much faster. In order to do that, they need to turn up the dosage.\n\nKinda like taking a picture with a film camera, you need a faster shutter speed and your film (x ray sensor) isn't any more sensitive, so you have to up the quantity of x-rays being generated in the same period of time (Same as turning the F-stop lower on your camera to get more light in). \n\nSpeaking of film, never put it in a checked bag, the x-ray machine will expose the film.

The Poet and the Pendulum was so very well done, and I'm glad they even played the mellow part at the end of the song. Marco playing The Islander and the crowd singing along gave me goosebumps. Fantastic. They ended the show with The Greatest Show on Earth, Ghost Opera Song, and Last Ride of the Day. Absolutely fantastic all around. I had a massive dumb grin on my face the entire show.\n\ntl;dr - 9/10 on its own. 10/10 with rice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431199858", "subreddit": "nightwish", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Like I had already sure and burnt throat for like a week after... \nAnd I didn't feel much high at all honestly. I felt like my usual self but a little more prone to some giggles here and there, and like a craving for snacks. He made him and I a toast sandwich each, it was heaven. I was kind of nervous about doing it and I read that quite a few people don't really get high the first time. Sat with the stoner for like 5 hours discussing movies and classical movies and it was pretty great. My friends were sleeping of course. \n\nSo overall the environment I tried it in was good and such. The experience was decent.

{"body": "My favorite part about this episode was the science behind some of Thunderbird 5's operations that they put in. For example, when EOS began spinning the ring section of TB5, John was pulled to the floor because of the centrifugal force, instead of just spinning around out of control. And this effect doesn't go through the every area of the space station, since he clearly floats in the main room as we've seen in previous episodes. \n\nAlso, the fact that when I was watching it, my brother asked why didn't TB3 just grab the spinning section, and I pointed out it had to match it's speed first otherwise it would rip the station apart, and it actually happened! That was very impressive. It shows that the writers have actually thought long and hard about this stuff, and made it just as good as the original.\n\nAll in all, a well thoguht out, very interesting episode Gr8 m8 8/8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431892823", "subreddit": "Thunderbirds", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Trash chute regularly backs up on weekends. Laundry rooms constantly in disrepair. Frequent unit entries by maintenance for vaguely explained and generally silly seeming reasons. \n\nBut it is quite convenient to campus, obviously, and I fucking love having my own room, as compared to sharing a studio in on campus housing. Get everything in writing during interactions with the staff - literally write down what they have said, and have them sign and date it, or else you may find yourself in a bind later. The furniture is okay, and the appliances are decent. Considering the fact that it's on campus, the price isn't horrific. Yeah, you're gonna get a tiny-ass room, but you'll be right on campus. \n\nMy rent is approximately $700/month. Those moving in next year will have a slightly higher rate. Keep in mind that a PSU parking pass if you have a car will be an additional $300/term.

{"body": "I like Angle of Attack, their training material is extremely well done. I got the Captain's package a few years ago, kinda pricey at $79 but broken down by instruction hours, it's a good price of beer/hour ratio. I like learning about how systems work, I feel I got more details out of the AoA videos than the PMDG manuals. But then again, they have different purposes.\n\nGroundwork is great for learning how everything works (seriously, it's more than what you ever want to know), Flightwork was very useful in how all those systems come together in a flight. Linework was kind of meh two years ago, not sure how it is now.\n\nA few years back there was an issue of videos being accessible and downloadable for a limited time. Not sure how that is now - I grabbed all I could back then for offline viewing. Someone with a more recent experience might want to chime in.\n\nWhat I liked about AoA was that everything was in one place, the cockpit flow diagrams in PDF were a fantastic resource, and the Flightwork videos filled in a lot of gaps from Youtube videos. I was sure to get high quality material, which is always a toss-up with youtubers, very few of whom know their stuff. \n\nI just got tired of watching Youtube and have someone make an FMC programming omission, and then troubleshoot the issue in flight for ten minutes. That kind of unfamiliarity with systems  is what put me off trying to get in-depth training from Youtube, and I just didn't have the patience to watch newbie after newbie fiddle with the knobs. The very few great youtubers only had so many videos up, and of those, even fewer were training specific. I ended up getting the AoA package because I hoped it would be amateur hour no more - and it wasn't.\n\nAoA seems to be a one person gig (or at least was back a couple of years ago), some of its decisons and the way they were implemented or communicated were a little unprofessional for my taste. That has probably evolved in recent years, and at any rate the 737 material is top notch, 10/10 with rice, would buy again.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432446811", "subreddit": "flightsim", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

But if you go into it with an open mind, and pick up some other marketable skills (statistics, engineering, programming, technical writing) you can still be fairly competitive in other quantitative careers. There are a few more arrogant people who think that they will be the next Feynman than in other sciences, but that usually gets beaten out of them in grad school. Also, the LHC is only one of the awesome places to work at. Granted it is the hot one right now, but there is so much more to physics than just particle physics, and a lot of very great places scattered all over the world.

It's a compact downhill monster. \n\nPros:\n\n * Small, at 84cm this is one of the smaller decks available, makes for a very light and nimble topmount. A great wee streamlined racing board. \n * Moderate w concave, nothing too outrageous, but enough to get your feet properly dug into those comfy spots.\n * Solid construction. this board can and will take a absolute hammering. \n * 24.5\" and 26\" Wheelbase options, the smaller is great for slower speeds and techier slides, the larger for more serious downhill and racing. \n * Large wheel flares for those big wheels you've been choking to try.\n * Did I mention it was small?\n\nCons:\n\n * Small, I'm 6'1\" and have a naturally wide stance, I find unless I'm properly tucking I don't stand too comfortably on it.\n * Grip wears pretty quick. Mostly over the flairs, found it got worn out after 2-3 days of sliding.\n * No KT, does not a good cruising/commuting board make.\n\n\nOverall I am extremely satisfied with this board. It's my main ride right now as it fits what I do perfectly. \n\nIt's compact shape and light weight make it a breeze to slide. You don't have to be aggressive to control this board with the right setup. Use the lower wheelbase option, &lt;45 degree trucks and some good 68-70mm freeride wheels for sliding and drifting with almost no effort and no bullying. You'll be sideways all weekend.\n\nCome race day, swap back onto the larger wheelbase and stick some 75-80mm wheels on thar and watch as it turns into a fast, nimble corner hugger that's smooth and stable. \n\nIf you are a downhill fan who dabbles in sliding and drifting in between racing and bombing hills, this is a great deck for you. \n\ngr8 sk8 r8 8/8 m8\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432816339", "subreddit": "longboarding", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Let it boil for a bit until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. 10/10 with rice.
