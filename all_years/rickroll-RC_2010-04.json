{"body": "Yeah!\nA composer colleague of mine has lectured me about this topic many times - I'll try and condense his ideas. \nIn general, dynamics and transitions are key to manipulating emotions. Creating expectations through by repeating a pattern, building up to the fulfillment of that expectation, and then fulfilling them creates resolution but also satisfaction in the listener. The metaphor he used was the countdown to the space shuttle launch - you know it's coming, and when the clock reaches zero, and the shuttle lifts off spectacularly, there's a sense of satisfaction for those watching. Same goes for sadness or longing if the countdown culminates in failure to launch. \n\nThere's a piece of his that uses the deceptive cadence thing I was talking about: http://www.reverbnation.com/play_now/song_1750682\nIt happens first starting around 46 seconds in. He'd probably be annoyed that I'm sharing his most commercial work, but I think it illustrates the idea.\n\nAnother example of subito piano creating a sense of sweetness is in this song by the Limousines: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuXOao6jBoM. The moment in question happens at around two minutes and fourteen seconds.\n\nThis one produces negative emotions within seconds of its opening because of the jarring introduction. I haven't quite worked out why this one bothers me so much though:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n\nI chose these examples because they are relatively simple in their construction and tonalities, so that the techniques used are pretty obvious.\n\nHope this helps! :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1270113899", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
