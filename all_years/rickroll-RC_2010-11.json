{"body": "Okay. Quick Reddit-history lesson then.\n\nThis meme started with Lost. Remember Lost's title sequence? Yeah. You can see where\n\n&gt;**L O S T**\n\ncame from. This one was used specifically for when a comment thread hits an unexpected twist.\n\nFast forward a bit. The movie *Inception* came out around when *Lost* ended. People moved on to\n\n&gt;**I N C E P T I O N**\n\nAnd, being the punny bunch that Redditors are, we started playing with other words, like \"Deception.\" These were good too, like \"Intervention\" above, because not only do they fit the context of the comments, they also look/sound a little like \"Inception.\"\n\nBut then as the meme was dying out, we got hit by the Digg-refugee wave. I get the feeling most of them didn't know why words were being bolded and spaced out but picked up on the fact it's a meme. This is where most of the incorrect usage comes from.\n\nInstant_yoghurt's execution of the meme was pretty good, so he's getting upvoted. Although this meme was meant to die out a while ago, it can be fun to see old memes pop up once in a while, [as shown here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288751995", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}
