Too bad I am disobeying the rule of the internet to argue with a troll. \n\nLet me just say Cannabis is the jam. In many ways it has improved my life, opened me up to many things and in ways I feel has made me more perceptive and intelligent. \n\nMarijuana is a known expectorant but alluding to tar deposits being not a negative is quite the oversight.  Also quite the juxtaposition that you claim sleep is better on marijuana , in many ways I see your point and many people do say sleep is great on marijuana and it does help people. BUT claiming once your used to sleep on marijuana going back to normal sleep sucks would be considered a psychological or physical dependence either way you view it. \n\nHonestly marijuana perks me up and I have never been able to sleep right before I smoke, it keeps my mind going. It is also WIDELY known knowledge that marijuana prevents you from dreaming. Recently I was reminded of how amazing and realistic you dream sober when I was sick for a week last winter and did not smoke. \n\nI agree with him in some ways, I have smoked nearly every day for years and the smoke (unlike alot of people because everyone is different) would make me sick. From blazing too much id get a sinus infection every so often, sore throats constantly and I would always cough. \n\nHonestly bro you just sound like a classic overjustifying drug user. \"YO that shits not bad you don't know what you are talking about\" \n\nAfter getting a flight box my perma cough i have had for years is now gone poof.
