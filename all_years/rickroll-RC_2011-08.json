The state is not allowed to fuck with your speech.\n\nIncidentally, the origin of the simile itself is from a case in which the US government was trying to suppress the [free political speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater) of someone who disagreed with them.  I can't really put my objection stronger than that and I really can't see the point of trying to make you happy by continuing this nonsense.

{"body": "Oh man, I've been waiting for a chance to tell this story.\n\nAlright, so this was a few years back. I was out one afternoon picking up some groceries from the local Walmart, and while heading back, I noticed a small VW Beetle off the side of the road. Judging by several dents on the left side, it looked like it'd been pushed off by another car (I'm American, the car was off the right side of the road). I just made a mental note but didn't stop because there was no one around.\n\nFast forward a bit. I'm sitting on the couch, surfing channels, it's about 8-9 PM. The local news comes on and I see a story about, you guessed it, the Beetle. The anchor went on about a group of teens who had taunted the person driving the vehicle, and upon not receiving the response they had wanted, proceeded to knock him off the road. The guy was taken to the hospital.\n\nWell, it turns out this group of teens was living in the house two houses down from mine, and the next morning I witnessed them going from house to house looking for the guy, they kept yelling that they knew he lived on this street. Each time someone would decline to point them the right way, they'd COMPLETELY trash the house. I'm not talking basic TPing or knocking over mailboxes, I'm talking full-on assault with baseball bats and axes, no joke. They were causing severe property damage.\n\nNow I suppose you're asking why all that's relevant. You ask, and I shall answer. I quickly devised a payback strategy.
