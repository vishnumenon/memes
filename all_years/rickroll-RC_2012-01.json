When people asked why I was dressed up, I explained that I was going to a conference in Copenhagen to present a time travel machine I invented. They seemed to buy it.\n\nThe next Monday, I came in and asked my Discrete Mathematics teacher if I could present a video I brought back from the conference. She agreed. The next day, I brought in an unmarked DVD, and I got to present my `findings' at the end of class. For credibility, I decided to preface the video with an explanation of the science behind the project. I explained that the time machine worked like this:\n\n1. Some matter is represented as a long series of 1s and 0s. The format that this matter is stored in needs to be 2-way; in other words, you need to be able to convert matter to data as well as data to matter.\n\n2. That series of 1s and 0s is sent as a series of electrical impulses to a device that stores data in the magnetic flux in the area, also known as a flux capacitor. The flux capacitor is held in a Faraday cage to minimize interference.\n\n3. Later, when you want to get the matter back, reverse the polarity of the diodes in the flux capacitor, then attach it to some device for transforming data into matter. This will reconstruct the matter just as it was when you first converted it.\n\nTo explain my idea better, I played a DVD on the class TV of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1326498728", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Phd in womens psychology checking in\n\nHere is what womens shoes are all about\n\n* socio-economic status\n* personality\n* role in society\n* shows power-balance between males and females\n\n1: Status;\n\nIn this regard does shoes serve as normal jewellery and differs in no important way from a golden ring or necklace. It shows how rich and important the wearer wishes to be and thereby gives an accurate measure of her inferiority-complex.\n\n2: Personality;\n\nMost women believe that there is a wide range of characteristics that can communicated through wearing the correct pair of shoes. In actuality the wearing of fancy shoes only communicates one single personality trait; namely that the wearer believes that her personality can fit in a shoe\n\n3: Role in society;\n\nThis relates directly to number 1 but has been given it's own space since it also should hold interest in it's own right. Womens shoes are meant to function in much the same way as extremely long fingernails have traditionally functioned; that is that they are extremely impractical and therefore shows that the wearer does not need to do practical work - thereby giving her a high status. As we shall see in 4, this is view of, say, high heels, are not correct but instead a superficial idea that hides the true purpose.\n\n4: Power-balance;\n\nWhat the wearing of extremely unpractical shoes actually does, is that it guides males as to how they should percieve women. High heels are by far the most common example of extreme impracticality seemingly for sake of aesthetics, so we will continue to use this as we go along. The most prominent feature of shoes like this, is that they inhibit the freedom of movement for whoever wears them, thereby rendering them vulnerable in any situation where practical action needs to be taken. This exemplifies the true relationship between men and women which is now regarded as tabu; namely that women are submissive and that men are dominant.\n\nAll of the above are the *underlying* reasons for why womens shoes have gotten the focus they have in society. Most people (including men) will deny this, since the common interpretation of shoes have been perpetuated our whole lives and therefore is now accepted as fact.\n\n[sources](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;ob=av2e)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327500736", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
