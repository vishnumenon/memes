{"body": "If the problem happens exclusively in chrome and not in other browsers or media players, then this isn't a hardware issue, or a driver issue. The manufacturer does not cover anything software related under the standard 1 year warranty.\n\nFortunately this probably isn't to terrible of an issue. In chrome go to to:\n\n    Wrench &gt; About Google Chrome\n\nThis should bring up an about box that will check for updates. If there is an update available it will start downloading and installing it, just let if finish, when it's done it will want to relaunch.\n\nGoogle bundles into it's updates the latest version of Flash, which may fix this issue. Youtube videos have issues if you don't have a current version of Flash, or if Java isn't up to date.\n\nAfter making sure you have the latest version of Chrome, go to [Java.com](http://java.com). Make sure to go there in chrome, as chrome uses a different version of Java than IE. There will be either a big red button or big blue button on that page to update java. Click on that let it update, close out of chrome and reopen it.\n\nAt this point you should test a Youtube video. I suggest this [audio diagnostic test video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). If it was just an issue with plugins then the issue should now be resolved. Hooray!\n\nIf it's still busted, restart the computer and try again. Still bad? Alright we'll try something else.\n\nIt's possible that you have the HTML5 beta of youtube enabled. This will use non-flash video, such as .webm, .mp4, and h.264 encodings. The issue could be caused by one of these formats. You can disable the HTML5 video format at the bottom of [this page](http://www.youtube.com/html5), which will set you back to the normal Flash based video.\n\nIf that doesn't work, there may be a conflicting issue within windows.

You need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. When we die, our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great circle of life.\"\n\nSo maybe the line of thought stops there. Maybe I quit thinking about my death because one day I'll be grass. But then I think about what that actually means. I, as I am now, am compose of billions of years of materials. Maybe I'm a few atoms of Cleopatra or Caesar... It is likely I'm a descendant of Ghengis Khan, says the New York Times. And maybe some part of me is from the ashes of a slave or handmaid. But more likely I have some dog, tree, and rock in me. But maybe, just maybe, someone that had a shit life and never got to really experience the joy is apart of me. Maybe there are some atoms in me that have never gotten the experience of being part of something that loved life. \nSo in a way, I have an obligation to all of that, just as I hope what I will become is something great. Maybe my ashes will continue in the circle of life, so me and my atomical ancestors will be part of the never-ending, always relatively trivial attempt at making the universe a happier place.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with this.
