String manipulation is something that is present in almost every language and i think it should be learned first.  \n\nlearn to substring, reverse the letters, concatenate, change every other letter to opposite case, display the ascii character value, and whatever else.  If you aren't familiar with a string tokenizer, get familiar with it.  Learn how to format a string.  Learn how to format numbers to display leading or trailing zeros and also to display commas like: 1,000.01000  .   The java string class has so many methods and you should really learn how to use each one.  Just look [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html).  This should be in your bookmarks toolbar.\n\nYou want a project?  I have a good one.  Write a secure password generator and have it saved a hashed version of the password to a text file.  If you are serious about programming you should also be familiar with the hashing.  Very simple concept really... and a lot of different ways to do it.  But yeah I know I could go through my different online accounts and make some of my passwords more secure.. what is more gangster than making your own.\n\n1.  Generate a sequence of random numbers in the range of the ascii character set that represent letters and numbers.  \n\n2. Convert those to the appropriate characters and you have your random password.\n\n3.  Hash and salt your password. \n\n4.  Append it to a file that has a list of your previously saved hashes.\n\n5.  Make sure the records of this file are formatted into columns that are aligned.  If you are ever required to gather data for someone, you should know how to format it.  You will be able to appreciate the organization for yourself as well. \n\nCheck out [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)  little gem if you don't like my idea..  some have said it is inspirational.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334441366", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

But I will not be merciful.  Nor will I be overly cruel.  This is what I would do:\n\n\nI would stew in my hate for quite some time, but, being a loving and forgiving person, that hate would begin to ablate... until I saw his face and heard his voice.  Then that anger would surge rapidly to the surface.  And so I would build a basement in my home.  One that is completely hidden from view, with access only through a secret bookshelf (because they are awesome).  There would be false-windows, and the basement would be finished, and relatively nice with a small kitchen, a bedroom, a living room.  He would be allowed to exist, but fully under my control.  There would be times when I would randomly turn off the power to the basement, such as during his favorite show, just to drive his spirit down.\n\nHe is now weak.  Suffering only through lack of human contact.  And this is when I would make my appearance.  I would drug him.  And when he wakes, he will find himself strapped to a table... with an IV of ACh (to prevent movement) attached.  I would place a small incision in his body and attach an electrode, to stimulate an cause an immense amount of pain to one nerve.  All the while, one song would play.  Something that would eventually come to be associated with his torture.  A good song, about love and loss.  Something to reflect what I have lost.  And this would continue until my anger is gone.\n\nNow that I am at peace, I will show my mercy.  He will be strapped to my table once more.
