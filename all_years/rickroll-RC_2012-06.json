{"body": "I was driving from Portland to Seattle a few years ago. I had prepared my playlist by just dumping a ton of my favorite songs onto my GPS. \n  \nSo my friend and I are cruising through a really boring stretch of freeway. You know the kind, straight, flat terrain, no real scenery to enjoy. Some 80s music was playing on the GPS. The next track came up, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n  \nWe just cracked the fuck up. I literally had just rickrolled myself.\n  \nAnyway, OP, you should include this song mixed into your playlist somewhere.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340878276", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
