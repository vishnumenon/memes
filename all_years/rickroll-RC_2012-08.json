{"body": "1. [Robo's Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOWf_T0jdgQ) from Chrono Trigger sounds like the introduction to Rick Astley's [Never Gonna Give You Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), though Mitsuda has clarified that this is a complete coincidence\n\n2. IIRC, several tracks from the Wild Arms games sound like Ennio Morricone's works (though, I guess you could call it homage or whatever). Most egregiously, [Rudy's Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps1dfLMB1bg) is nearly identical to [The Ecstasy of Gold] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUZiLFPJhc) from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\n\n3. The [Legend of Zelda Intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyMKWJ5e1kg) sounds at times very much like Deep Purple's [April](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYsCAHLR_40) - I'm pretty sure Koji Kondo has confirmed this in an interview\n\n4. The [Title Theme from A Boy and His Blob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=top4-XlTdJA) is reminiscent of the [Indiana Jones Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVNNhBtBbOs)\n\n5. The [Metal Gear Solid Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqqq8uqSDnk) sounds like the [Snowstorm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JL4JXEv-RY) from Georgy Sviridov's Winter Storm. I remember reading somewhere that legal action was taken against Konami, but I'm not sure\n\n6. It is rumored that the track [Raid on Dollet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8ngpfUw_pg) used in Final Fantasy VIII's demo never made it to the full game due to a resemblance to Hans Zimmer's [Hummels Gets the Rockets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vo9pPP8-Fc) from The Rock. It was replaced by the (fantastic and better, imo) [The Landing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_HxjU8TolU)\n\nIn fact, here's a site dedicated to the topic (with some excellent examples): http://www.flyingomelette.com/oddities/musicalsim.html\n\n*Edits: More tracks as I think of them", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344206704", "subreddit": "gamemusic", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}
