{"body": "Good thing is it took us about 500 years to go from pre industrial to what we have managed so far- and that's without knowing any of it was even possible. I'm sure any rediscovering of lost knowledge would be far faster, and on a scale of 50,000 years just a blip on humanity's existence so far.  \n\nPeople would probably refer to what we have built so far as a hedonistic and naive society with broad sweeping generalisations about what we used to get up to. Due to most all of our information being kept in digital/paper files which don't last all too long on the scale of things, a lot of information about us would be skewed and based on what not only survived the nuclear holocaust but the ravages of time. How many hundred years would a skyscraper stand for? What about the sealed vaults of gold underneath crumbling ruins?  \n\nExpeditions into contaminated areas would bring back fascinating discoveries every day, but examples of *working* machinery and computations would be all but non existent.  \n\nBut one day it would be found. A computer left under such strange circumstances that it could be brought back to life. Like scientists try with the extinct species today. Men would work furiously to resuscitate the sleeping machine. Their technology already leaps and bounds ahead of ours today.  \n\nCould the lone file left unscathed be the first tangible view into the world of these people that came before?
