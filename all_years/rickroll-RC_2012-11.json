{"body": "**A small collection of my funny beta stories.**\n\n\n**Oh Hi There**\n                 \n I was running around the south side of TI Alloys, defending the recently captured area from heavy Vanu tanks and air. It this point in the beta I had unlocked the AA rocket launcher so I was trying my best to help out and knock down some scythes (this was of course before I had seen the light of Vanu). As I was locking on to my next target and dodging plasma from the Magriders I watched as two Scythes flew on the same path. With the entirety of the sky to fly in, these two pilots had decided to take opposing paths and play chicken; and neither of these pilots wanted to be the one to move. So inevitably they hit each other. The unexpected outcome of this was that they didn't instantly blow, oh no. The pilot flying from my left got away from their little game unscathed  and continued to kill and laugh his way to many cet points. The pilot coming in from my right however hit the other scythe in just the right way so as to be launched at an amazing speed, right into a nearby tree and promptly blow to kingdom come.\n\n**I Need A Ride**\n\nI was playing with two of my mates on Amerish and I had spawned a Lightning before they jumped on. These two idiot mates of mine decided it would be a good idea to continuously jump in front of my moving Lightning. This went on and on until I became weapon locked which leads me to my next, short, story to share.\n\n**It's Not Over Tell The Heavy Sings**\n\nDue to my weapon lock I could no longer shoot the enemy. This put a hamper on my plans for the next base. I was killed a couple of times and then I eventually got a great idea. **I** would improve moral. Thats a great idea. I decided to [sing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). After about two minutes of my atrocious voice polluting the proximity chat I was promptly shot in the head by a friendly infiltrator.\n\n**Get Out Of There Liberator**\n\nToo finish up, I will tell you the story of my amazing piloting skills. Playing around in the beta with my two aforementioned idiot friends, I had the great idea to spawn a liberator on one of the nearby bio-labs. Did you know that if a liberator falls between the landing pads it can get stuck there and will not budge? Did you know that I'm a terrible pilot and I couldn't land a plane if it would save my life? Guess what happened.\n\nWell I hope you enjoyed my stories.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353636509", "subreddit": "planetsidefunny", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
