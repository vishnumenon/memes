{"body": "Much of this debate has been focused on economics, and possible social factors. I think we're framing it wrong. A philosopher at Colorado has written a paper on rights theory and [immigration](http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/Immigration.pdf). I'll summarize an example he uses that we can all relate to: South Park. \n\nIn many of the South Park episodes, there is a character named Starvin Marvin. If Marvin is, indeed, Starvin and is asks me for food, I ought to give it to him. I fail to confer a benefit if I don't. Thus, some might say I might as well have killed him. We can all agree on this, right? \n\nNow, assume Marvin is still alive, and wants to walk to the market to get some food. People are willing to trade with him, it's an open market, ect. Now, imagine I see him going to the market and I shoot him. Again, I'm acting unjustly. I am acting unjustly even if I didn't shoot him and just restrained him from going to the market. The actions of governments in restricting immigration (by-say-closing the market) are analogous to me when I shot Marvin. Governments, therefore, harm (and subsequently violate prima facie rights) by not allowing immigrants to stay in the country. \n\nAlso, [this is not a rick roll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354690833", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
