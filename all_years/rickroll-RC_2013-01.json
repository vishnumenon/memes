We ended up going into Null around Jita, and GENTS sure weren't appreciative, seeing as we got a big fleet dropped on us. I was burning back and jumping through the gate which was Low &gt; Null. I end up jumping into low sec, spamming warp, and a Rapier slaps a web on me, and my Loki instawarps to a station, in 97% hull. Fun stuff. I repair and we keep on roaming, far away from the null. We run into a guy running a livestream. We couldn't catch him, but we ended up grabbing an [Oracle](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=18418820).\n\n After we sat playing station games, we end up joining their fleet and reship to go into a Null roam into Test Space. We are holding on the last HS when a guy took an alternate route and got jumped in his Vigilant. He died, we warped in, Proteus jumped through and the BC support warped out. We snagged the [Loki](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=18419896), he went nowhere, and popped. Fun stuff. We go into Null, all the while the fleet was just making fun of Test, apparently; Test intel channels are infamous for being slow/shitty. Anyway, we end up engaging a [Maelstrom](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=18421153), he jumps, I jump through because he's going to make it to the jump.  A keres points him, I'm able to burn in and pew pew while everyone sits out the 30 second timer.

{"body": "&gt;I guess the scenario I'm imagining is that Ruth takes a bath, puts on perfume and nice clean clothes. She knows what she is meant to do - she isn't a virgin or in any way a stranger to sex or male desire.\n\nYou might say...[they were no strangers to love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n&gt;Once he falls asleep, she comes over and (apologies for the explicitness) whips out his dick and starts giving him a handjob, possibly is rubbing her ass into him, etc. Dry humping stuff.\n\nIt's *possible*, but it's rather speculative to draw that from the extremely opaque Hebrew phrasing.\n\n&gt;This wakes up an understandably confused, still partially drunken Boaz. \"Who is it?\" \"It's Ruth, you are my guardian-redeemer, marry me!\" \"Oh, well, hrm, there is this other guy who essentially has legal dibs on you, but if he doesn't marry you I will. Just stay here tonight and we will sort it out in the morning\". So now you have this old guy lying next to this younger girl who was just dry humping him 20 seconds ago. Both of these people are widow(er)s, and presumably both have sexual desires. They have sex, or at least continue the dry humping. Maybe it goes on for an hour, maybe it goes on all night. Certainly not impossible or even improbable either way.\n\nWhile I agree that it's possible, if they had sex Boaz would've just stopped talking at verse 11.  He essentially says \"dayum, girl\" in verse 10, and \"I won't hurt your reputation\" in verse 11.  But then he says \"there's another guy who can marry you, so figure things out with him\".  It sounds to me like he at first wants to sleep with her, and then decides to wait it out between verses 11 and 12.\n\n&gt;I could easily see them having sex regardless of whether their marriage would be a sure thing or not. People do that all the time, and I think this would qualify as particularly tempting.\n\nYes.  But given the wording I'm not sure that's what happened.\n\n&gt;I also don't see why she would sleep over. Why risk being caught for a longer period of time? \n\nShe does leave before it's light out, and before artificial lighting there wasn't much risk of her being caught in the morning anyway.\n\n&gt;And as for the length of the sexy times, there are certainly times where I say I \"had sex all night\" but didn't have 8 straight hours of intercourse.\n\nFair enough.\n\n&gt;Again, I have to fall back on 3:14. I can't imagine a scenario where they would be using \"feet\" to mean something quite sexual and then randomly decide that feet actually means \"sleeping at his feet\" a few verses later.\n\nThe author could be playing with the double-meaning.\n\n&gt;Anyways, thanks for the discussion. I'm well aware I could be wrong (the nature of such things, eh?), so I hope you don't take offense.\n\nNot at all.  I'll happily concede that your view is possible, I just think mine is somewhat more likely.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358817547", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
