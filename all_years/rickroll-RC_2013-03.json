{"body": "\"Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing; A hundred mother fuckers can't tell me nothing\" -Nicki Minaj, 'Beez in the trap' \n\nI find this very insightful and has changed my outlook on life.\n\nFirst off, Nicki point out that there are certain people in your life who will try to bring you down. They will try to drag you down to their  level and beat you with experience. These individuals spend their time and effort in an attempt to make your life worse, and that you should ignore these people and cast them out of your life. Furthermore Ms. Minaj goes on to explain that these people are just sheep. They don't act on their own free will and they just conform to how everyone else around them acts, and since they are in a clique of degenerates that is the life they have been sucked into. \"Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing\". This is some powerful stuff right here and these are words I live by.\n\nThe second part, \"A hundred mother fuckers can't tell me nothing\" is equally important in it's own way. Here she outlines how you should just be yourself. You should act and treat people how you wish to be treated, and you will become surrounded by people who care about you and who are similar to you in how they behave. You shouldn't conform to how society and the media say you should, be an individual, the world would be boring with ought you! \"A hundred mother fuckers\" is referring to society and the media and how they try to warp you into how they perceive what people should be, and when she says \"Can't tell me nothing\" she is standing up for herself and saying that you need to be yourself, because that is who you are.\n\nThat opening line from \"Beez in the trap\" by Nicki Minaj will forever be the most powerful lyrics in music history for me. The words of wisdom she presents within the first few seconds of that masterpiece have changed my life for the better, and for that i am grateful.\n\n [Here is a link to her music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). I think this is the one song everyone should hear once in their lives, and it is an honor to be the one to have shared this with anyone who has never been kissed by the works of Ms. Minaj.

{"body": "\"Babies are born with the natural ability to swim and dive, reaching depths of up to 10m as recorded by the *Instituted For Infant Research* in 2008. Like other animals, Human babies are able to swim on their own within as little as 6 hours after birth. It is encouraged by Dr. Hiroshima Nagasaki to start letting your child swim as early as possible to allow their aquatic skills to develop early on. As humans are the most intelligent of all the known animals on our planet, human babies are actually born with many survival skills/instincts already fully developed to give them the greatest chance of survival.

{"body": "I had a really sound computer science teacher, who usually laughed along with us when we pulled pranks and suchm so we decided to go all out one year. We had a big group of students in on it, and got a few people to distract the teacher while the rest of us set up. First of all, we did the classic duct-tape-under-optical-mouse-trick, then we took the batteries out of every clock in the room. We then uploaded [this bastard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to her pc, which we copied and pasted into a ton of different locations. Then, we changed the target of every desktop shortcut to a different copy of the video, deleted/hid any folders, and got rid of taskbar icons and stuff. After all that, we daisy-chained three sets of speakers from the pc to the other side of the room, and cranked them to max volume. We disguised this admirably, running it behind posters on the walls, etc. **Time for the big payoff.\n**\n\nThe mouse part of the prank was pretty shit to be honest, got a chuckle out of the teacher, and only provided minor amusement to the students. We didn't mind though, the next part was about to unfold, and it was going to be *glorious*. She sat down at her pc, about to start the lesson. Loundly remarked about how dissappointed she was with our unoriginal prank. We sat in our seats silently, the excitement and tension building as she turned on the projector so the class could see her screen. Everyone was totally focuse at this point, waiting to see what would happen. The teacher didn't pick up on this, and got ready to open *Internet Explorer*. As her cursor swooped across the screen, one girl asked to go to the bathroom, where I assume she fainted from the mental stress of the situation. The teacher, almost in slow motion, double clicked the icon on her desktop, and I braced myself for impact. A few agonising seconds pass, as nothing happens. Suddenly, vlc media player loads up to the teacher's confusion. boom. The opening drum beat of Rick roll starts blasting with the intensity of a fucking jet engine from three corners of the room, what I'd imagine God's farts to sound like. The teacher, and most of the class jumps, and for a few seconds nobody knows what to do. The teacher breaks into laughter, and claps, having got the reference. She closes vlc media player, tries a different desktop shortcut, same result. She still laughs. Tries another. This time, she falls victim to the curse of having windows XP, and her pc freezes. Eventually, it gets sorted out, she knows what we've done and she applauds us. Job well done. Except it turns out that our prank had some hilariously awful consequences. Apparently, there was an assembley going on a few rooms down, for a different group of classes about a guy who had won in a battle against heroin addiction. Just as he had started a moment of silence for a friend of his who died of overdose, Rick Astley had started blaring extremely loudly. He waited for it to stop, and tried again. The teacher then tried again, with the same result. The third time, the man had come to the conclusion that it was being done on purpose, and launched into a rant about how disgusted he was with our disrespectfull antics. Cue me and a few friends being stuck with the blame for the whole thing, and the heads bitten off us by the \nheadmaster. \n\n*TL;DR: Accidentally Rick Rolled a heroin addict's moment of silence in a different room.*\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364103975", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1306, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I work for the internet, I can explain this. It's not as evil as you might think.\n\nThink of internet content like a kid's toy box. The stuff the kid plays with the most is going to be on the very top, easy to get out now matter how big or unwieldily it is, because the kid is constantly playing with it. The stuff the kid never plays with is going to be at the very bottom, dirty, sticky, and hard to find and get out.\n\nThis is actually how big webapps, including video streaming apps, actually work.\n\nSince advertising is not only frequently accessed, but also valuable, it is always the most available content. It's ready to go out at a moments notice. They don't sit on disks, they sit in RAM. They sit on multiple cache/CDN servers. Ads are always at the top of the metaphorical toy box.\n\nThat 240p video you want to watch that hasn't been viewed in three days? Well, it's not in cache, so the cache servers have to ask the app servers for it. The app servers don't remember even how to get it (they have their own cache), so they have to ask the database servers for it. The database servers (again, with their own cache), take awhile to find it. The database servers tell the app server that the content is sitting on a network share with a certain weird filename that makes no sense to a human. The app server opens the file, which is sitting on the slowest disks at the bottom of the network file server's toybox, so it comes through really slow, through the app server, to the cache server, and all the way from there to your browser.\n\nThen again, if you had instead chose to watch something like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, it might actually load faster than some of the HD ads, because it is accessed so frequently.\n\nEDIT: Phrasing", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364419320", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
