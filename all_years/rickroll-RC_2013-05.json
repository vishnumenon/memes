He kept throwing references to Nibiru into questions; like, \"what is the name of one of the moons of Mars?\" or, \"What happened in December of 2012?\"  I violently marked out all of those and wrote \"NO\" underneath or next to them on the actual exam.\n\nI eventually work my way to the final page.  The page before was \"intentionally left blank.\"  On the aforementioned page was one question: \"The picture below explains one of the surprising facts about the solar system.  What is the most amazing thing?\" The picture was that of a comet, with a quote by Neil deGrasse Tyson: \"Half of Pluto's volume is comprised of ice.  If you drag Pluto to where the Earth is now, heat from the sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. **And that is no kind of behavior for a planet.**\"\n\nThe answer choices were:\n- You can save a bunch of money by switching your insurance to Geico\n\n- Astronomy gangnam style!\n\n- Students Christmas tree exams without reading all the options and miss the fact that (e) is the right answer to this question.\n\n- That people can be bothered to watch Honey Boo Boo\n\n- One day we may be able to surf on Pluto!\n\nThe kicker?  He let us remove this page from the entire test booklet and take it home with us.  It has a [QR Code](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) on it.
