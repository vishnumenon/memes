{"body": "Well I would like to share my point of view into this...  \n  \n\nFirst of all I really hate gutturals, growling and screaming in music it's like WTF? I just don't get it, I mostly reject everything with that way of ''singing'' but I can have my own exceptions.  \n  \n\nThen, I also really hate when people take for metal, only Death/Thrash/Black/Grind and calling metal that screamo/emo/scene/hardcore shit. That drives me nuts! I will affirm that metal as a whole genre is the most diverse thing you could even imagine, seriously everyone can have a place in the metal genre, so as you say keep your mind open and you easily could find something that makes you say ''Wow! It is like alien made!''  \n  \nThat said, I truly love metal, but just as music, call me a faggity fag, but mosh pits? lolno. What’s the whole point of smashing you with other people and left the concert more retarded that when you came? I don't dress all in black ''because I’m a rebel and I’m so hardcore'' please, stereotypes are dumb and a lot of people like metal plus a bunch of different kind of music.\n  \n  \nSo what happens when I say that metal is huge, metal can coexist with other genres and even merge? Well then you can have the most amazing experience in music!\n\n  \nI can agree just in a part with /u/DrDerpberg, the growling/screaming voices have their effect more like in emotions and feelings than into their ''quality or skills''. Here we go with the examples...\n  \n   \nYou are now going to enter in to a new universe of music that you provably ignored because all that trash music and ''satanic summoning shit'' that ''defines'' metal.\n  \n  \n* What about some Tango violin and a Hispanic like acoustic guitar merged with some blast beat battery and growling? Then you have this masterpiece: [Ne Obliviscaris - And Plague Flowers the Kaleidoscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMorAdnCixg) \n  \n  \n* Who says that growling takes the first place? Here you have some slowly symphonic metal, with a powerful background voice and an awesome breath taking opera like leading voice! [Within Temptation - Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEKD0nlwVU)\n\n* Another grate example of the leadership of voices, a duet between a female and male singers, both taking the first place! [Eluveitie - Slania's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWB5yQESe5o)\n  \n  \n* Pure growling with opera chorus, plus cellos and epic percussion's? Here: [Haggard - Per Aspera Ad Astra ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSFEv9eaoh4)\n  \n  \n* Want to feel in the ancient ages? This ''Band'' will make you travel in time with Varg Vikernes new and more mature material, his deep voice narrating epic slices of the Nordic mythology. [Burzum- Umskiptar (Full Album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9za4GFaQ)\n  \n  \n* Keep it folkish, fast and loud! [Equilibrium - Unbesiegt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWZYvALtHpk)  \n   \n  \n* Back to basics, the always awesome S.O.A.D: [System of a Down - Psycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJTi_I_Q_tU)  \n   \n  \n* Not really gutturals but kinda harsh and loud for some ones :P [Rammstein - Mein Teil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGKXo-IBj8)  \n  \n  \n* Trendy nowadays, super melodic and heavy song: [Wintersun - Sons of Winter and Stars ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbFu457jGs)  \n  \n  \n* Are you into trumpets and awesome violins? This is your place: [Turisas - Rex Regi Rebellis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBh-LDZPSbY)  \n  \n  \n* One of my favorites gosh, what a chorus, that atmosphere, so much into this song! (Just live performance, never recorded in studio) [Metsatöll - Raua needmine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXcup1ZsJXA)  \n  \n  \n* A very funny one, just found this in their official channel, not a track upload with the album cover :/ [Knorkator - Ich hasse Musik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-3PQf10myk)  \n  \n  \nAs you can see from now I'm squeezing my library to give you some examples, but this is not my element, I just have a few ones to show you. So I kept the best of all for the end!\n[Surprise Song! ;)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)  \n  \n  \nHope this is helpful, there are a lot of different styles, you have the Nü Metal and the Neue Deutsche Härte with though lyrics and some techno beats in it, I just want to tell you that you need to push effort not into forcing your ear and listen to the ones you already know but looking for new ones till you found the style that fits you.  \n  \n  Keep Rocking /,,/,\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370860696", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey I don't know if you have figured this out yet but you are wrong. A klondike bar is a rectangular prism with a square base made of ice cream coated in a chocolate shell. It is due to ice cream's tendency to melt in above freesing temperatures that  /u/eyeoutthere said 15 mins tops and its klondike soup. \n\nThe Klondike bar was created by the Isaly Dairy Company of Mansfield, Ohio in the early 1920s and named after the Klondike River of Alaska and Canada. Rights to the name were eventually sold to Good Humor-Breyers, part of Unilever. It is known for its jingle slogan, \"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\".\nThe first recorded advertisement for the Klondike was on February 5, 1922 in the Youngstown Vindicator. The bars are generally wrapped with a silver-colored wrapper, upon which the mascot for the brand, a polar bear, appears. Unlike many similar frozen treats, the Klondike bar does not possess a stick for a handle, as opposed to a traditional ice pop, a point often touted in advertising.\nThe Klondike Bar was also the first created ice cream bar with Good Humor taking the idea and adding a handle or stick to become the first ice cream bar on a stick.\n\nMany types of Klondike bar have been sold:\n\nSix original Flavors in 1922 with chocolate coating:\n\n* Vanilla\n\n* Strawberry\n\n* Chocolate\n\n* Maple\n\n* Cherry\n\n* Dark Chocolate (Dark Chocolate Shell with Vanilla Ice Cream)\n\n* Orange\n\n* Krunch bars (with crisped rice in coating)\n\n* Heath bar bars (with Heath toffee in coating)\n\n* York peppermint patty bars (with peppermint ice cream)\n\n* Neapolitan bars (with neapolitan ice cream)\n\n* Planters caramel and peanut bars (with nougat-flavored ice cream)\n\n* Triple chocolate bars (Chocolate shell with chocolate ice cream plus \nchocolate syrup between the shell and the ice cream)\n\n* Butter bars (with vanilla ice cream)\n\n* Caramel pretzel bars (with caramel coating)\n\n* Cappuccino bars (with coffee-flavored ice cream)\n\n* Chocolate bars (with chocolate ice cream)\n\n* Hershey with almond bars (with Hershey chocolate and almonds)\n\n* Whitehouse cherry (vanilla ice cream with cherries)\n\n* Strawberry cheesecake bars (with swirls of strawberry syrup and pie crust)\n\n* Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (with peanut butter cup pieces)\n\n* Oreo (with \"cookies and cream\" ice cream) (USA only, though this same product exists in Canada, it is not under the Klondike brand)\n\n* Rocky Road\n\n* Mint Chocolate Chip\n\n* Double Chocolate\n\n* Fudge Brownie\n\nAdditionally, the following products have borne the Klondike name:\n\n* Minis Snack Size Vanilla Ice Cream Bars\n\n* Slim-a-Bear Premium Fudge Bar\n\n* CarbSmart Ice Cream Bars\n\n* CarbSmart Fudge Bars\n\n* Klondike Nuggets – similar to Bon Bons and sold during the late 80s[2]\n\n* Choco Taco\n\n[A classic Klondike commercial for your entertainment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372574282", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
