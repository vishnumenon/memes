I personally program, listen to music a lot and I got myself a drawing tablet to well... draw with.\n\n- Learn programming. If you're into computers, then it's just awesome to do.\n\n- Go learn to draw. Creating pieces of art out of nothing is just plain awesome.\n\n- Listen to/play/write/create/embrace/evaluate/share/deny/hate music. There's just so much in music that can help.\n[This song helped me initially.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahjMrcHAVaw) Don't worry if you don't like it. I got some more.\n\n- Read books. \n\n- Write books\n\n- Become a linguistic expert by studying linguisticity\n\n- Become a neologist and come up with argulacting new words.\n\n- Go socialize. Many of us fapstronauts (I still hate that word) are/were somewhat sociophobic. Just go do something with friends, don't think of going to a bar or 'going out' if that's not your thing. You can game at a friends house with a couple of friends, that's awesome too.\n\n- Swear a fucklot more, it's fucking awesome.\n\n- Don't swear too much, it can hurt some people's feelings.\n\n- Don't take all advice on the internet too seriously, take it into safe consideration though.\n\n- Build a fucking time machine because why the fuck not you're only limited by the laws of nature, and those seem to support the idea of a time travelling machine.\n\n- Sports, if this is not your thing, like how it's not mine, it's still a good idea to do workouts to stay healthy and get a bit more into shape.\n\n- Eat healthier/Eat less unhealthy crap. You seriously do not need every single snack you eat. You'll forget about them 3 minutes later and in return you got unhealthy crap in your body. *If you really feel the need to eat something, eat some fucking carrots those are fucking delicious.*\n\n- Study. Not something you don't like, but study something you do like. \n\n- Play some games, online is awesome, online with friends is more awesome. Offline (board/card/other) are more awesome with friends and or family.\n\n- Talk to other idiots who can't seem to do this challenge, like me. Take advantage of the community.\n\n- Send your future self email via [futureme](http://www.futureme.org). It's somehow very helpful to send yourself failures and wins of the past. And it's somehow a lot of fun to do.\n\n- Get a porn blocker [for example k9](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/)\n\n- This one is actually really important for an overall better life. Devote some time, every single day, to some small tasks. Like cleaning your room, washing dishes, doing homework.\n\nIf your room looks like mine, or other tasks are bigger than normal for you, devote just 5 minutes a day to that task. 5 Minutes is not a lot at all, and it'll still have results if you do it daily. You will mind less doing 'boring' tasks.\n\n- Gardening. Eating your own fucking fruit/spices/~~flowers (some people do this, don't judge me)~~ is awesome as fuck. It will attract life as well (but you're 18 only, getting some plants for in your room is awesome as fuck anyway. It really changes the way your room looks and feels. It's healthy as well.\n\nIt can really make some big differences, just one - three simple plants inside your room.\n\n- Compliment good behavior. That of yourself, and that of others. People will fucking love if you give legit compliments. (You can start out with faked ones,** fake it until you make it.** It actually works for this)\n\n- Do not give up (like me every 2-3 days ^^)\n\n- some other songs that helped me \n\n    - [New age (might even be Christian, not sure :O)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nioflv9Xn5I)\n\n    - [My favorite song of all-time. Extremely relaxing and just takes me away from everything in existance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYiFa8TBQUU)\n\n    - [Something completely different. Maybe you're into harder styles?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FTz45BX4go)\n\n    - [some positive trance vibes are ALWAYS extremely welcome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMNO7je-y6U)\n\n&gt;I'm pretty beta by nature\n\nNo you're not. You're pretty beta by upbringing, your own beliefs and lifestyle. Believe me, I've been there.\n\n- Watch birds outside. Birds are awesome to look at.\n\n- Take some time to look at the smaller things in life. This becomes automatic for me from about 5-6 days in.\n\n- Don't be afraid to enjoy whatever orgasms you have. Don't take yourself down when you relapse. Don't fear wet dreams. Don't fear nudity on television/ads/whatever. It's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n- Pick a few things to do, don't try to do everything.\n\n- Get a pet to care for (I got a budgie. It's fucking awesome to talk to the little fucker.)\n\n- Important one again. Be your-fucking-self. If you really dislike something*, then simply don't do it. If you really want to do something but didn't have time/money/other weak excuse to do it. Then you're lying to yourself, and you go make the fuck sure that you do it anyway, if you really need the money, work for it.\n\n- * Learn the difference between not liking something and being afraid of trying something new. I always thought I hated outside (I'm pretty sure the internet over here is familiar with this). It's really not as bad as I always thought. I always thought I hated going out, but it's not as terrible as it sounds as long as you do it with people you're comfortable with.\n\n- respond with 6k characters to a random post in /r/nofap new.\n\n- Origami. All you need is some fucking paper, don't even need a pencil/pen/brush or anything like that. There are some really cool things you can make with origami (I made some cups you can actually drink out of from one piece of paper for example. If you get good at it you can make [dragon sculptures](http://epicfail.xepher.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/origami-dragon-1.jpg). Or actual animals if you don't like fantasy stuff)\n\n- /r/getmotivated\n\n- /r/projectreddit\n\n- /r/bored\n\n- Read this whole crappy post.\n\n- Don't take the broscience too far, nofap is a good thing, but there simply are people who don't need it, people who balance PMO well. Don't force it on anyone (And don't bother going into discussion in other subreddits, nobody will care. Only do it when people are mildly interested. Feel free to annoy your friends with your streaks though. They'll laugh at you while looking at themselves in vain. They'll call you back the next day to get them involved with this crap. Trust me)\n\n- Tell someone. It helps.\n\n- Drink craptons of this magic fucking drink called tap water. It's fucking delicious, refreshing and has a huge impact on literally everything you do.\n\n- Get involved with something. Anything. I joined a project to help code a website.\n\n- I don't even know, come up with your own shit.\n\n- Check [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/kud1z/alright_rnofap_lets_get_a_list_going_of_why/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ykjle/gravity/) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n- Go to festivals/concerts of artists/bands you like, it's the friendliest introduction to 'going out' if you used to dislike that like me. (I went to see Lindsey Stirling, had some bad excuses to not go to some other festivals. Don't not go to festivals by me)\n\ntl;dr No. Fuck you, read this shit if you're interested. No tl;dr.\n\nThis might kickstart you a little bit, maybe.\n\n^This post is obviously partially satirical and sarcastically self-hating. Please do not take this post 100% seriously, but try to find your own truth in whatever you may have read.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373499001", "subreddit": "NoFap", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
