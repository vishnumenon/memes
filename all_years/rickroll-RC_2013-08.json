I've been to plenty of parties and bars where the band plays covers without announcing who wrote the song.  You're free to make the assumption that they did not write it, but then, you are also free to make that assumption of the most banal of pop stars.\n\nSecond: under that definition, who do you give \"artistic\" credit to for a song someone writes but never performs?  In these cases, the composer can't perform and the performer can't write -- the piece as a whole could not exist without both talents.\n\nAnd lastly, and possibly most relevantly: credit *is* given to the song creator / composer.  It's in both the credits and the royalties.

{"body": "I can shine some light on this. This video takes place in Osaka, Japan and the people in this video are hosting a LAN qualifier tournament for the upcoming national championship (Starcraft S5X). The man that is getting beat up was in charge of delegating the minion spawns via bluetooth network. As the player (the assailant) was in midst of destroying one of the enemy towers the man behind the bluetooth headset made a misjudgment and yelled out to the player to discontinue his gameplay because of a violation; which eventually cost him the game. After the other referees reviewed the call, the player was deemed in the right and because of qualifier tournament rules the player was handed his loss without a redo. He was a favorite going into this tournament but unfortunately due to a an error on the referees part this young man was sent home empty handed.

And the [GTX TITAN](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121724) is better for multi-monitor gaming at the $1000 price-point. The TITAN can also achieve better performance through SLI than the GTX 690 can.\n\nKeep in mind, these are all single-card suggestions, and there are a lot of cheaper dual or triple card solutions that might give more performance at the high end. I can also not vouch for the exact performance from each card linked, as I haven't personally tested every variant from every OEM.\n\n**This is what happens when OP doesn't specify a budget.**\n\n**EDIT:** If you pick out a card/price-range you like, reply to this comment and I'll get back to you with more information on other OEM cards in that range. We can also talk about expected performance and if it'd cause bottlenecking with your current system.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377969304", "subreddit": "buildapc", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
