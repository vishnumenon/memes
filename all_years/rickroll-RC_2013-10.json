{"body": "You are clearly just being petty and arent getting the point.  I like you edit to the parent post, solidifying the fact you dont understand what I am saying. \n\nThere are two types of almonds, bitter and sweet.The almonds in snickers bars and for general cooking are sweet almonds and do not contain cyanide.  The cyanide is from the bitter almond, and is the reason why they taste bitter. You are making yourself look foolish and stupid with even suggesting that.\n\nYour fact that concentrated nicotine is fatal is not wrong, but everything around that is moronic. You are just merely suggesting that dosages are lethal and going 'SEE DO YOU SEE POISION!!', trying to infer the point that in can kill you instantly.  After doing some research on the matter, the most common cause of nicotine poisoning, the result of coming in contact with concentrated nicotine, is from using nicotine as an insecticide, not from smoking or using an e-cig or using a patch.  That DOES happen yes, but the majority of causes are from industrialized farming.\n\nThe reality is that it doesnt happen the way you are trying to make people believe. Does it happen? Sure, in isolated niche cases people have died from putting o ntoo many patches or a child eating cigerettes. The majority of cases are much more sane, much more treatable. and people dont come in contact with it and die instantly, they have an onset of symptoms and they can receive treatment easily.\n\n\nSo in the end, your point is that it CAN happen. and that doses CAN kill you.  Do you realize you are making essentially the same argument that you are calling moronic? Thats called ironic.\n\n[Source 1](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101027124734.htm)\n\n[Source 2](http://www.health.am/ab/more/nicotine-poisoning-common-in-tobacco-workers/)\n\n[Source 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\nEdit: Spelling", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380588877", "subreddit": "news", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "He was sitting in a chair, sweating profusely while the light from a single bulb swung wildly above his head.\n\n\"So... Mr. Pime, I'll ask you again, what have you been doing all day?\"\n\n\"I...I told you already, Mr. Smith! I came in at 8, sat down at my desk at 8.10 and started to work on that project that you assigned last week!\"\n\n\"Lies!\" His boss shouts \"I was hoping that it wouldn't have to come to this, but it seems that I have no choice. Lisa!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Smith?\" A voice from overhead, it's Mrs. Johnson, Mr Smith's *personal* secretary.\n\n\"Bring me the strongest stuff we have. I need to know what Pime was doing today.\"\n\n\"Right away, sir!\"\n\n\"Please... Please Mr. Smith, I have a wife... Children! I just want to go home and see them! I've done nothing!\"\n\n\"Silence! I'll hear no more of this nonsense until the truth serum gets here. Then I'll be all ears to everything that you have to say.\n\nSeconds... Tick... Minutes... Tock... It felt like forever to Pime, who sat in his chair, fruitlessly trying to slide the handcuffs off of his hands. But it was no use. His boss had found his wife's special handcuffs in his drawer. The purple fuzzies had him in a bind. It was useless.\n\nThe door slams open, and there, silhouetted against the light, was Mrs. Johnson, in her hand, a small vial.\n\n\"Here you are, Mr. Smith!\"\n\n\"Thank you Donna, you may leave for the night, I'll see you in the morning; and remember, you didn't see a thing.\n\n\"Of course not!\" Donna leaves with nothing but the scent of her flowery perfume to even suggest she had even been in the room.\n\n\"Now, I'm going to put an IV in, then I'll inject the truth serum, you'll have no choice but to tell me the truth, so I'll ask you once again... What did you do all day??\"\n\n\"Please! I told you, I worked all day on--\"\n\n\"SILENCE! I've had enough.\" Mr. Smith pulls some duct tape out and covers up Pime's mouth, and the only sound to be heard is Pime's whimpering, and Mr. Smith whistling out of tune to the themesong of Law and Order: SVU.\n\nHe wheels around a table, and pulls the cloth back, revealing a number of surgery tools. He pulls out a needle, and ties a band around Pime's arm so that he can see the veins even more clearly. He slowly and deliberately pushes the needle into Pime's arm. Now sweating like a 13 year old who had just found porn, Pime is struggling with all of his might, and trying to talk, but with his mouth taped shut, nothing but incoherent babble is escaping.\n\n\"Quiet!\" Mr. Smith shouts while hitting Pime on the top of the head. Pime's head slumps forward in defeat. Knowing that he only has seconds, maybe minutes left before the truth will be known. His dirty secret. The one thing he can't bear to let anybody know. He thrashes around, trying everything that he can to escape the chair and fuzzy handcuffs, but it's useless. Everything... Is useless. Mr. Smith slowly pushes a needle into the bottle of truth serum, slowly pulling back on the stopper. He withdraws it and pushes the plunger ever so slightly, expelling the tiniest amount. He flicks the needle twice, a horrible, maniacal grin on his face.\n\n\"After I inject you with this, you'll have roughly five minutes before it starts to work, and then, everything that you think, everything that you covet, you'll tell me!\"\n\nMr. Smith slowly inserts the needle into the IV line, and with a smile like an evil clown, he slowly pushes the stopper, releasing the truth serum into the line.\n\nPime slowly starts to feel a warmth spread over his body. It's as if all of his cares have floated away. So what if Mr. Smith knew what he did? \"No!\" A voice in his head shouts, we must keep it secret! \"But what if... What if it doesn't matter? What if it's all ok? A second voice asks. \"Maybe he won't care!\" \"Lies! When he knows, we don't know what will happen to us! Think of Jodie! That beautiful woman that we married fifteen happy years ago! Think of Maxwell, and Julia!\" Sweet, sweet Julia. She had just started her first day of Kindergarten this morning. How he had hoped to be the one to pick her up! But alas, it wasn't meant to be.\n\nPime's eyes are fixated on the clock, slowly watching the second hand move around in a circular motion. A circular motion of death. Pime knows that he's watching the precious seconds that he still has drift away. How he had wished to go skydiving!\n\n\"So... Pime, I'll ask you once again. What were you doing this morning??\" Mr. Smith asks as he yanks the duct tape from Pime's mouth.\n\n\"Nothing!\" Pime shouts. Surprised that his voice hadn't betrayed him, Pime looks up with a smile.\n\n\"Keep smiling, son. It's only been two minutes. In three more, I'll know it all.\"\n\nEach second seems to speed up. A minute feels like a second, and before he knows it, that minute hand is pointed straight up at the 12. It's 6:00 in the evening, he should have been home, having dinner with his family. Maybe Jodie would come looking for him! Maybe she would call the police! No... She knows that I work late on Monday's, she won't expect me until later... Much, much later.\n\n\"Now... I'm going to ask again, and this time, I'll know that what you're telling me is the truth. Tell me, Pime. Tell me and I'll keep Jodie safe. If it's reversable, I may even let you live. But I need to know. What were you doing this morning?\"\n\n\"Bring me my computer... Please... I'll show you..\" Pime murmers. Knowing that it's useless. He couldn't lie if he wanted.\n\nMr. Smith walks casually over to the door and starts to twist the doorknob. \"Know that trying anything is fruitless, you'll just waste what energy you have left.\" And with that, he's gone. The door closes with a *snap* and silence. Silence that presses in on the eardrums. Silence that will drive a man crazy.\n\n\"How long has it been since he's left? It feels like hours!\" Pime looks up, it's only been 10 seconds since his boss has left the room. \"But, but, that's impossible! I feel like I'm going mad! It's surely been longer than that!\" Another quick glance at the clock, he's been gone for 20 seconds. \"The clock is defective. It must be,\" he tells himself.\n\nSeconds later, the door opens, and there's Mr. Smith with Pime's laptop.\n\n\"I'm going to uncuff you. Try anything, and the last thing that you'll see will be me.\" Mr. Smith threatens as he places the laptop on the table, and slowly unlocks the handcuffs.\n\nPime lowers his hands to the computer, and types in his password \"JodieandPime4ever!\"\n\n\"Seriously? That's your password?\" His boss snickers as he's watching over his shoulder.\n\nPime doesn't tear his eyes away from the screen, but slowly navigates through window after window. Barely breathing, barely thinking, barely alive.\n\nFinally, Pime pushes himself away from the table, and all that's left open is one folder. Mr. Smith cuffs Pime back to his chair, and slowly walks over to the screen with his brow glistening from the fluorescent bulb.\n\n\"Ha... ha... hahahahahahaha! Have fun with this one boss!\" Pime shouts with his last remaining breath, and with that, his head drops to his chest which no longer rises and falls with life. But instead, a shell, a shell of a proud man once sat.\n\n\"Enough of this...\" Mr. Smith mutters, \"Nobody shall know that it was I in this room.\"\n\nHis finger slowly navigates the trackpad and clicks on the [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381450656", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Awwwww, thanks boo &lt;3\n\n**EDIT** In case anyone is interested. (Protip, use RES to expand all the gifs while reading for full effect.)\n\n   **Game of the Week: Sorry Fantasy Gods vs San Fran Cracka Killas**\n\nWell, we adopted the decimal scoring system to avoid situations like this. With about 5 and a half minutes left in Monday night’s      game,  caught a 10-yard pass from Philip Rivers. The result was 1.2 more points to Cody to bring his game against Justin to a 116.58-116.58 deadlock. Woodhead didn’t get another touch in the game, and this game finished as a tie. Kind of an anticlimactic yet exciting end to a game that was projected to be close the entire weekend. Both teams needed a win for playoff positioning, and it’s easy to imagine this is how Cody and Justin feel because of this one.\n\n http://i.imgur.com/ZaRMXGN.jpg \n\n\n**Team of the Week: The Real King in the North**\n\nThere was no dominant team this week as none of the other eight teams who didn’t tie put up more than 104 points. Tim’s 101.4 performance was a gritty effort that put his team in the final playoff spot for now. It was a very close effort for him. Vernon Davis’ near record-setting day put him in position to win, and DeMarco Murray’s touchdown before getting injured sealed it for Tim. The team, for the most part, struggled, but it found a way to win. It’s got to be gratifying for a team that’s been up and down this season.\n\n http://i.imgur.com/EAObD9K.gif \n\n\n**Surprise of the Week: Get Behind Me Sanchez**\n\nTwo weeks now this team has failed to score more than 90 points. Only three players scored more than 10 points this week, and everyone else laid an ostrich egg. Another shocking performance for a team that was so great the first four weeks. I wouldn’t throw up any red flags yet, though, because Brandon’s eight bench players scored more points than any teams starting lineup this week. He will need to manage a lineup a bit better if he hopes to stay in the running for the top seed. Otherwise, this team might coast into a window.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dKmWGC9.gif \n\n\n**Buttfuck of the Week: The Bluth Boys**\n\nHe had the No. 2 team right there. Finally got some support from his team as , MJD and Fitzgerald all had good games. So how did he lose this game? Peyton Manning scored 13.1 points against the NFL’s worst team. It was the first time this season Manning got less than 20. The only reason this team has been competitive in the first five weeks in now the main reason this team isn’t 3-3. That’s gotta be more painful than going to a party with the Duke lacrosse team. Sometimes, you can just stare in horror.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VTzlZ8T.gif \n\n\n**Power Rankings**\n\n\n**1. Kip Me Baby One More Time (5-1) (+0)**\n\nTravis keeps chugging along. Third highest score this week and an easy win against The Team That Shall Not Be Named. His San Diego players struggled, or else Travis may have been our top scorer. Moreno continues to benefit from having Manning as a QB, putting up 30.4. Couple that with DeSean Jackson’s big game, those two players alone outscored his opponent. That’s three straight wins, and Travis can seemingly just kick back, have some popcorn and wait for the postseason to start.\n\n http://i.imgur.com/SsZ8pbG.gif \n\n\n**2a. Get Behind Me Sanchez (5-1) (+0)**\n\nAnother disappointing effort, and this time, it cost Brandon his honor of being the top-scoring team in the league. Luckily, Emerson was on the schedule so it wasn’t two straight losses. A trade for DeMarco Murray should stabilize the RB2 position, depending on his health. And the depth on this team is scary. Counting players left on his bench, Brandon had five players break 20 points and seven who eclipsed 15. Games against bottom-feeders Cody and Murphy follow before the schedule tightens up.\n\n\n**2b. The Cleat Foxes (5-1) (+0)**\n\nThe last of our 5-1 teams, Bryan has quietly won five straight games after losing in week 1. That loss against Brandon is still enough to keep him slightly behind in the rankings, but there is hardly any separation now. Bryan hit 100 for the third straight week and has averaged 132.5 in that span. He is quickly kicking it into gear, and with five games left against teams with losing records, the playoffs seem to be a guarantee. \n\nSeriously, just look [how stacked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) this team is.\n\nIt's about as stacked as honorary Club member, McKayla Maroney \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/750L8vG.jpg \n\n\n**4. The Real King in the North (4-2) (+2)**\n\nWe already mentioned his clutch win earlier, and it was enough to catapult Tim into our upper-tier. The only 4-win team in the league, he is holding on for dear life to that final playoff spot. This team doesn’t always win pretty, but he wins, and that’s what counts. Tim made a big trade this week, getting Jay Cutler, Chris Johnson and Jordy Nelson, which should do wonders for his team’s depth. It should only improve going forward, despite the injury to Julio.\n\n\n**5. San Fran Cracka Killas (3-2-1) (-1)**\n \nSo close to winning, until the man from North Platte, Neb., ruined Justin’s hope of going 4-2. It’s a really bitter pill to swallow, as the highest-scoring team in the league has won only half of its games. That’s just how fantasy works sometimes. It’s not always about how your team does if you get scheduled against tough competition. Just gotta learn to make the best of a bad situation, like this:\n\n http://i.imgur.com/2r6eCq8.gif\n\n\n**6. James Starks of Winterfell (3-3) (-1)**\n\nTrenton’s team has seen its scoring dip its past two weeks and has lost two of its past three. Aaron Rodgers is having a bad season by his standards, and he isn’t getting much from the skill positions. Trent Richardson has been nothing but a disappointment so far, and the receivers are good but not great. Four of his next five are against teams with losing records, so there is still hope for a playoff berth. It will be an uphill climb, though, for an owner seemingly at wit’s end with his team, just like Jürgen Klopp.\n\nhttp://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/809704033.gif \n\n\n**7. Sorry Fantasy Gods (1-4-1) (+2)**\n\nHow close/bad are teams 7-9? Cody moves up two spots this week for tying Justin. Hell, it isn’t a loss, so it’s progress. But still, it seems like a loooooong time ago that this team was 1-0 and looking good. Cam Newton’s breakout game eased any concerns of Vick’s injury, and the rest of the team had a really solid week. Scoring 116.58 is no easy task. He’s three wins behind the final playoff spot with seven games to go. It will be an enormous feat if Cody can sneak in. The schedule is difficult, but this team does have a lot of talent, despite its record.\n\n\n**8. The Bluth Boys (2-4) (-1)**\n\nOh, what could have been. If Peyton Manning just equaled his worst week so far this season, Emerson would have won. Alas, Manning fell 7 points shy of that benchmark, and Emerson lost again. Fitzgerald finally had a big game, and his running backs got him 24.2 points. With Morris healthy, Emerson could easily pick up a few wins and come close to finishing with a winning record. The biggest problem on this team, still, is lack of depth. With 7 weeks to go, does Emerson FINALLY make a trade to try to get back in this thing? Until then, this team is stuck in its current place.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/V9zJl8D.gif \n\n\n**9. Dos Auto Draft (1-5) (-1)**\n\nWhat can you say? All year, the rankings have boasted about the potential on Jackie’s team, but she is third-to-last in scoring in the league. Matt Forte has been the only consistent performer on this team, which has been getting next-to-nothing from its wideouts and Tom Brady. Injuries have also been ravaging this team. Jackie has yet to play our top three teams, as well as Justin, the top scorer. Things could get a lot worse before they get better.\n\n\n**10. Bob Stoops’ Left Pinky (0-6) (+0)**\n\nI imagine this is the reaction of owners when they see Murphy is their next opponent.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IGZkN9N.gif ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382124461", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
