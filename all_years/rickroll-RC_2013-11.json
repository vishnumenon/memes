{"body": "It was a dark and stormy night as I rolled in my unmarked explorer down 95 south just before the 495 split. Normally I don't like the rain, but on this night it matched my mood and the hunt was on, so to speak. A red Toyota Camry sped by on my right, the vehicle reminded me of my cheating bitch of an ex-wife. As I reflected on the fateful day that I decided to come home early my thoughts were abruptly  interrupted by a black Mazda that unnecessarily cut me off - It would appear the prey came to me.   \n\nSo I notified dispatch of my location and ran a 10-29 (wanted check) before lighting the asshole up. I always get an adrenaline rush when I flip on the 360's and that stop was no exception, as a police officer you never know what's going to happen. There could be a little old lady  in that car or that vehicle might be occupied 4 times with gangbangers looking to blood in. Traffic stops are inherently dangerous and even a moment of laxity could be fatal. \n\nI pulled up 30 feet behind the vehicle and then slowly approached the vehicle, one hand on my 9mm. The adrenaline pumped even harder when I saw the tinted windows, \"fuck I can't see what's going on inside\". The rain picked up as I approached the driver's side window that had yet to be lowered. My senses were sharp, the smell of moisture in the air mixed with the smell of rubber and oil. The window began to lower, the distinct smell of CDS (marijuana in this case) hit me like a brick. \n\nI was surprised that the driver of the vehicle was none other than Jennifer Lawrence. Before I could even say a word she grabbed me by the balls and we had filthy animal sex on the hood of her car on the side of 95, It was glorious [For those of you who don't believe me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

{"body": "Yes. I think he did. Looking at those pictures alone, one can tell what a cold blooded and evil man he truly is. Look at the way he has his right hand wrapped across his abdomen with his left elbow covering the wrist of his right hand; and the way he has left index finger massaging his temple. BELIEVE YOU ME, that right there, is malevolence and evil personified. He's probably wrapped-up in self-consuming, ego-boosting thoughts, about how his Machiavellian plans have come into fruition because the media, courts etc al. **are** blaming the Talwars for the crime.\n________\n\n\nThere's this one documentary-styled video uploaded on Youtube by an anonymous (voice has been morphed.. the video was originally uploaded to an account that goes by the name \"IndianDeepThroat\") journalist who followed and reported the case very closely. Even he/she theorises that Praful is actually, **the one**, behind it all. \n\nIn this video:\n\n* IndianDeepThroat firstly talks about how the attention given by the mainstream media to the case bloated it up in the collective mind of society/nation and made \"Aarushi\" a household name, whom almost everyone and anyone identifies with. The case had taken up the form of a Reality TV Drama; it had intrigued and aroused the curiosity of society, and had some sickening sense of \"entertainment value\" to it.\n\n* IndianDeepThroat secondly talks in detail about how the investigation was botched up by the Investigative Agencies (the police and then the CBI); and how the evidence, from said botched up investigation, was then shared with the mainstream media to be broadcast to households across India. At every turn and every new day, a new theory was being discussed in the full glare of the TV Cameras.\n\n* IndianDeepThroat thirdly discusses the evidence used and talks about how most of the evidence used by the Investigating Agencies to pin the blame on the Talwars is merely circumstantial. (This part makes up most of the length of the video).\n\n* IndianDeepThroat then tells us that the Talwars are being targeted to appease the collective conscience of a society hungering for the punishment of a crime everyone and anyone had followed at some point or the other. Thus, society &amp; the media wanted and **needed** to see someone being punished; to finally provide closure to the multitudes who have heard about the case i.e. Society needed a **Scapegoat/Sacrificial Lamb** (the Talwars). It was all done to make society at ease, to maintain appearances, to maintain the illusion of a society/governmental machinery that is capable of finding wrongdoers and **delivering, not \"upholding\",** justice.  [](#s \"DAE believe in an omnipresent, ever watchful Supreme Being/Beings??\")\n \n* IndianDeepThroat finally, in a brief 5 or so minutes, talks about his theory of  how Praful was the actual mastermind, and provides some stirring evidence.\n\nIf anyone is interested, here's the [link to the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385479549", "subreddit": "india", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
