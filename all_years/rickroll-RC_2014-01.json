I had to download it from Kazaa. And it would take 30 minutes to download. But you could watch the beginning if it had already downloaded ~10% or so.\n\nAnyways, I came home from school for lunch one day and nobody was home, so I started downloading a whole bunch of porn (because sometimes a video is actually a [Rick Roll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). Therefor you need to get a few going to ensure a decent video is found. Anyways, so back at this time of my life, I had an obsession with blowjobs. It's what really did it for me. So I've got about 20 videos downloading (and again you have to base your picks off of title alone, no previews whatsoever) So there are some disgusting sounding picks. (Whore sucks big dick, College girls share one dick, etc..)\n\nSo I'm fully charged and going to town while I sample the first 10 seconds of each video, when my Sister (who is around 17) comes home with some of her friends as well to have lunch. So I'm upstairs in the family room and I flip out. Tuck my boner into my waistband as they come running up the stairs and I close the videos and applications. She asks if she can use the computer (there was no sound playing at this point) and I just look at her confused and terrified. (mind you I'm sitting here staring at my desktop wallpaper). I get up and go downstairs to the kitchen and as I'm leaving hear my sister say to her friends \"This song I'm going to download for you guys is so good\" Which translates to me as \"Hey guys, let's check out all the porn my brother is downloading.\"\n\nI hear stone cold silence for a few seconds, then a whole bunch of \"ohhhh myyy goood\" Needless to say that was the most embarassing moment of my life.\n\nThank you for your time Reddit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389366615", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I didn't ignore you, it's just easy to edit that out.\n\nJust so we're clear, I'm not talking about [Interstitial Ads (animated)](http://i.imgur.com/WsTL6Hl.gif) I'm talking about a [Lower Third Ad (animated)](http://i.imgur.com/FJhyDw2.gif)\n\nInterstitials are relatively simple to remove if you can accurately detect when they have occurred. You just cut and stitch the remaining ends back together. Compared to having to re-encode the video stream, this one is practically a gimmie, but it's still going to be a decent amount of work to process the stream, identify the ads, cut them, and place the whole thing back together in one piece. It's not as CPU intensive as re-encoding, but you still occupy a great deal of memory in the process, and without human intervention, it's not going to be perfect. The detection algorithms out there for ads are mostly tuned to broadcast TV. Much of what makes it to YouTube is exactly the same sort of thing that these algorithms are trained to cut out, you'd have to invest a ton of time to tailor them for the difference in content, and even then it's not an exact science. Some people go to YouTube to see funny ads themselves, how does your algorithm figure out which content is which and cut only the right one? It's not even possible to be anything approaching 100% accurate with automation.\n\nOn to the real argument that I've been making, if YouTube really wanted to force the matter, they'd just use Lower Third ads. As you can see from my linked image above, they are running with the video occupying the \"lower third\" of the actual video stream, you could cut them, but you'd lose an equivalent amount of content to what you cut in ads. Alternately you can black out or blur that portion of the screen, but then you have to re-encode the whole thing to put it back together \"sans advertisement\" and you'd still have no recourse if there were some audio drops running with it, you can't automatically remove that overlayed audio. At best, you've expended a whole shit-ton of resources, time, and energy to replace an add with an equally intrusive black bar or blurry smudge, who would bother?\n\nI reiterate, if Google wanted to force the issue on ads, they'd do so and there's nothing you could reasonably do about it without seriously diminishing your user experience. If they encrypted and added the ads to the video streams themselves, either as an interstitial or a lower third, the results wouldn't vary because the bandwidth, processing, and resources needed to make any of what you have suggested with this alternate distributed PirateTube thing possible would require either an extremely well off benefactor to pay for your huge army of servers, or you'd have to start placing your own ads in the video to cover your costs. The first is laughably unlikely, and the latter is wholly defeating of the point itself. The only other alternative would be to let the player decode the video stream for you locally on your own PC in realtime, a process that would take as long as it would to watch the content in the first place, then take that stream and run it through the ad detection algorithm, cut the ads, reassemble it and watch it sans ads some 5 minutes after you could have simply watched the content in the first place.\n\nThe only reason that the existing AdBlock solutions are able to do what they do so easily is because Google chooses to serve the ads from an alternate URL which the AdBlock software can easily identify and simply tell the browser not to load. If YouTube even went so far as to serve ads from the same [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) URL structure as they do now instead of http://ads.youtube.com/adidentifier, you'd have a hell of a time making a system that would be capable of only blocking the ads 100% of the time, because the actual content and the ads would have no easy marker delineating the two as they do now. The best you could hope for is a game of cat and mouse where Google would always be a step ahead in thwarting your efforts.\n\nYou couldn't be more wrong about this. It's not as if Google doesn't employ some of the best engineers and computer scientists in the world. The barriers to what you are proposing are stifling just on the basis of how the technology works as is, and that's before you start to consider that were you to manage to breach those barriers (which would be practically unassailable if Google chose to implement them) you'd still have one of the most well trained and armed forces in the IT world to contend with were you going to attempt to maintain the breach. A force that has nearly limitless money, time and engineering to throw at just about any problem. The fact that you are able to block ads on YouTube is only because Google doesn't care to force the matter, the changes that they would have to make to force those ads to play with your content would be trivial to implement and nearly insurmountable to defeat.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389769715", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
