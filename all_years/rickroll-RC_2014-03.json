{"body": "In the middle of the 19th century, an man by the name of Charles Renwick road into the City of London on the back of a shabby, malnourished horse.  He approached the gates of Buckingham Palace and demanded of King William IV that his horse be fed, groomed and and roofed at his own expense because he felt that as an Englishman, who served King and Country for 15 years, fighting in Spain, France and Africa, he, and his horse, had a right to the the same treatment as the Kings ceremonial parade.\n\nHe waited outside the gates for 8 days.  Each day protesting more and more, to the delight of the locals and business men on trips to the city, gathering support and attention from local media.\n\nFinally, on the 9th day, after several attempts to have the horse and the man removed, King William approached the gates himself and asked to speak to the man privately.  After about 20mins, both the King and Mr Charles Renwick, now with a smile on his face and a skip in his walk, returned to the gates where the King made the announcement that the new appointed Sir Charles Renwick of Kent would take over the position as Head of the Horse Guard, situated just off Whitehall.  The reasons he gave were \n\n1. That Sir Renwick had shown much courage, determination and patients over his 9 day 1 man protest\n\n2. That now he was a firm favourite with the common men of England and popular with the local and national media it would be remise of him, as King, to waste a good public figure\n\n3. The former head of the guard had sadly passed away the previous evening from asphyxiation. Rumour has it he lost a bet on how many peanuts he could hit into his mouth whilst being tickled by a naked midget. \n\n[A statue of Sir Charles Renwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) now stands proud outside Horse Guards Parade, as a monument to all the bullshit that is in the world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394577942", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was 22 I went through a \"bisexual phase\" (I'm happily married to my husband of two years now).  I put a listing on, and within a week I had a full inbox, mainly creeps and obvious fakes. After two weeks, I was about to remove the listing when I finally got a (seemingly) legit reply. The girl was interested in meeting up, which I hastily agreed to. Looking back I was very stupid and careless, and am very thankful things turned out the way they did. After exchanging phone numbers, I agreed to come over to her apartment the next Friday night. \n\nI was extremely anxious the week leading up to it, but also very excited.  We exchanged pictures and I was practically soaked from Wednesday on. Looking back I should have probably been abducted with how careless I was, but I was hormonal and desperate. I had a friend drop me off, who tried to talk me out of it once we got to the complex, but I was determined. The apartments themselves weren't too bad, albeit in a sketchier part of town. I anxiously waited outside, and ended up calling her instead of buzzing the door. I could hear footsteps approaching the door, and I realized that things were really happening. I panicked for a bit, but once I saw her open the door my worries melted. \n\nShe was shorter in person than I expected, standing only to my sholders, but she was cute and had nice....  assets. She smiled and stepped aside and let me in. Her apartment was cozy, but nothing special. She asked if I wanted some wine, which I quickly accepted. I hated every sip, but I knew each drink we took would bring me closer to feeling underneath her clothes. Several glasses later, and we are sitting on the couch shoulder to shoulder. By now the wet spot in my panties was uncomfortably noticeable, so I excused myself to the bathroom. I tried to unfluster myself, and walked back out to find she was waiting for me outside. Long story short, our lips touched and the rest followed. It would be the first and last time I tasted another girl, but I don't regret it one bit. Afterwards was...  Interesting. We crashed in her bed for a short while, and I came to and realized that I might not be a lesbian after all. My friend picked me up shortly after, and I crashed at her place. I woke up the next morning and she had left a voice mail thanking me for the time, and asking if I wanted to hang out sometime again. I said it was fun, and lied that I was only in town to visit my family on break, and we broke off contact after that. \n\nAlthough I regret being so reckless, it was a eye opening experience and I feel it shaped me into the person I am today. I met my husband half a year later, and we have been in a committed relationship since. \n\nEDIT: I may have worded things a bit...  Provocatively. On the couch I was turned on, but I doubt it would have actually been noticeable. I went to the bathroom to try and calm down a little bit and make sure I actually wanted to keep going through with what was happening. \n\nEDIT2: To give a little more insight, I had initially thought I would like being with a girl as much as a guy, but afterwards I realized some fantasies should just stay fantasies. I was more interested in the taboo of the act, than the act itself. I felt this wasn't fair to any girl I would be in a relationship with, and decided this would be my first and last hookup. I do sometimes still feel curious, but thankfully my husband and I have other ways of handling that :-).\n\nEDIT3: If I had to give one piece of advice with Craigslist, it would be to BE CAREFUL. Under the piles of spam and creeps, there are some honest people looking for a fun time. Try to confirm that the person is real as best you can, and don't ignore any bad feelings you have going into the experience. Make sure a friend knows where you are and what you are doing, and try to have a plan to get picked up at a certain time. \n\nThis all seems like common sense, but I was so caught up with getting an actual person's reply that some of my judgement went out the window. Think with your head, not with what's between your legs. \n\nFINAL EDIT: I made a vlog a few months back better explaining the physiological aspect of our short relationship. It's nothing much, but I do a better job describing my thought process during the whole ordeal. I also go into the sex itself, and try to explain what I found enjoyable about being with someone of the same gender, even though it made me realize I wasn't bisexual after all.  I appreciate all your comments, and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of creepy PM's. \n\nI'm wary of showing my face and such, but I feel sharing the video will help you guys better understand the situation as a whole. I don't make videos anymore, so like or dislike, I don't care.
