{"body": "&gt; Sponsored Gifts: There was a clear intention with gifts such as GPUs and or RAM from our sponsors. On the day this was fully intended for the crowd only, the plan for follow on tournaments was always promised by sponsors to feature these prizes for the players (these dates will be announced soon). The partners are fully committed to their program with us for more hardcore players, but also bringing casual players / spectators closer to the experience is a refreshing focus, when at times they can feel left out or alienated when things get to serious.\n\n*Am I the only one around here who does not fully understand how this works? Bringing casual players and spectators closer to the experience is achieved by throwing GPUs and RAM into the crowd? Please take note, at IEM these 'crowd only' winners are invited onto the stage and a proper photo is taken. Comic-Con was not a parade nor a snackbar, it might having been a spur of the moment thing and appeared [awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y), but it hindsight it appeared very unprofessional. We are certain that the sponsors are committed to their program, but why are players always left wondering when they will get to play? Why are there always so many unannounced dates and last minute changes to the schedule and the event itself. /u/P3TC0CK was able to find earlier versions of the same event page, which was changed very closed the tournament date.*\n\n&gt; Technical Gremlins: We are investigating with the venue services and technical team some issues encountered, this is for the good of all events in future. Our partners and sponsors are seeking answers from the venue as to why we had sudden network down time while internet connections were very stable. Players and fans look to PLG to ensure these things do not happen on the day or in the future. With such inconsistency in the region, it starts with the experience at each venue looking to host such new activities. No conclusion has been reached yet as to where the issues originated and until we know for sure no one is pointing fingers. The venue is being extremely supportive and professional in proactively investigating to improve conditions for the future.\n\n*Every single e-Sports event will suffer from technical problems at one stage or another. DreamHack, MLG and Gom EXp experience issues on a regular basis and they are the best in the business. However the difference between these organizations and 'Power League Gaming' is that they actually admit to these technical difficulties either on live stream or via social media. Furthermore, difficulties are expected and some of the set-ups are very technical, PLG could benefit from hiring professional IT personnel to help avoid these issues. \nWhat exactly does PLG mean by such inconsistency in the region? This happened at the Dubai World Trade Center with Etisalat providing internet and network access. The issue probably lies within the fact that a 16MB line was the only source for the entire venue. The only possible solution towards this problem is for PLG and/or others to spend money on an appropriate and stable network for future events. Otherwise spectators, sponsors and players and expect this to happen every singe time. It is not only about preventing them, but knowing how to deal with them once they arise, moving and scrapping entire parts of a tournament is not ideal for PLG or any of the players.*\n\n&gt; Titanfall and eSports? Featured for the full three days in partnership with Xbox and EA, we had our fingers crossed for the private lobbies to enable us scheduling team match ups from our top FPS players, but sadly this did not arrive in time for the Comic Con. EA works very closely with PLG to ensure we do our best for the regions players, and we considered a 6v6 for Battlefield 4, but due to the focus on Titanfall from Xbox and partnership with NVIDIA GeForce for the PC version, it was not viable at this event to run our AMD setups for Battlefield 4 (note that AMD are committed to showing this off very soon to fans).\n\n*Keeping your fingers crossed is not the way to go when it comes to running a professional tournament in-front of 'thousands' of spectators. You either have everything set-up and in place or you don't, it's that simple. Taking into consideration that 6 months of alleged planning went into this event, it casts further doubts on PLG's ability to not only plan, but more-so execute a live tournament. \nThe other detail that strikes me from that paragraph is the conflict of sponsorship. Because Titanfall was the main attraction, it was considered 'not viable'? or were you simply unable to because of contractual agreements. Again, the 6 months of planning did not cover the eventuality of Xbox and EA being unable to deliver on Titanfall.*   \n\n&gt; League of Legends: Finally, the League of Legends prize of 25,000 AED was announced with a 10,000 AED for the runners up. 8 teams pre-selected by TTesports were sorted to brackets on the Saturday and final matches began on the same day. Due to the network conditions at the venue that arose, a swift decision was taken to put the continuation of the tournament to a vote. Players voted publicly, and unanimously to suspend the tournament, prize money intact and inclusive of the full years sponsorship communicated pre-event. PLG and the sponsors fully intend to honor the request of the majority of players and fix a date for players to conclude this competition.\n\n*Network conditions affected game play and and the tournament itself, to be exact over three full days. PLG held a vote for the League of Legends to be rescheduled. I do not believe that players should have a say in tournament decisions which do not directly effect the game itself. There are technicians and referees at other e-Sports events who can determine if a match or tournament can go ahead of not, you will never see Sundance go up to the players and ask them for their vote.*   \n\nIn conclusion, take into account everything you have seen, heard and read about PLG over the last few weeks. It's up to you to make your opinion, but keep in mind that e-Sports will never ever be on par with what we see in South Korea, Europe and the U.S. as long as you have an organization such as PLG at the helm. Frequent players will know that the rescheduling of tournaments, late prizes and no prizes are the norm.\nMany of you travel long distances, splash your hard earned money on entry and tournament fees, spend long hours waiting for your turn. It is your right to demand change and it is now up to you, to let PLG, their sponsors and partners, know and change will come. I am convinced that e-Sports can thrive across the region, but it should not come at the expense of us, gamers, in order for a few individuals to make large sums of money.\n\nThink twice before attending another PLG event, think again if you really want to spend your money at one of their zones, vote with your wallets and let others know.*\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this piece, it's a shame that IGN is unable or unwilling to be more forthcoming, their headlines are nothing more than [click-bait](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).  \n\nI welcome comments and feedback from IGN, PLG or any others who care to shed light onto recent events.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397666076", "subreddit": "MEGaming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
