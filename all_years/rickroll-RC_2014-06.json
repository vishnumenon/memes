{"body": "I gripped the bar in front of me, uncertain about where to go from my current position. Cameras flashed obnoxiously from the Press Gallery opposite, and people surrounding me variously read the program in front of them, tapped holographic handheld devices or stared blankly into space, waiting.\n\nI found it curious that none of them, however they chose to waste their time currently, found the fact that the most evil man ever to exist in recorded history sat nonchalantly at the mahogany desk below.\n\nI should probably explain my position at this point. I'm sure that all of, one way or another, have found out about the invention of the time machine. I should also probably mention that I was one of the \"Beta Testers\". This was my beta test. I couldn't possibly have had the audacity to imagine that what I would see could be this monumental.\n\nBut anyway, as I implied before, Hitler sat before me, unaware of my intent stare on his slicked back hair. From what I could gather from non-suspicious questioning, Hitler had been taken right after Eva Braun pulled her trigger, and just before Hitler was about to pull his. Right now though, he was flanked by a pair of armed guards, each holding some sort of futuristic device that I couldn't hope to decipher the use or function of.\n\nAs I pondered these things, and by what method I could descend the stairs and kill Hitler before anyone else reacted, the judge entered from an erstwhile unseen door. I don't pretend to understand how a court proceeds, or what the words that were said meant. You can click [here to get a full transcript of the proceedings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\nHitler climbed up to the witness stand. The jurors glared at him as he moved slowly to his seat. He audibly sighed. He knew the inevitable would come.\n\nA disheveled man strode towards Hitler, doing his best to exert an aura of confidence, and failing miserably. This was obviously the defence lawyer.\n\n\"Adolf Hitler?\" he questioned.\n\n\"Ja-yes,\" Hitler murmured, unconsciously using German but catching himself in time. I should add, it was definitely convenient of me to arrive in a country that spoke English. You could argue that it is too convenient, but in what cases do languages spoken by so many people die in a hundred years? Yes, some words were new and unfamiliar. What is a \"Dumbbullion\" or a \"Surnjin\"? I don't know. But it didn't matter. Meaning gets its way across.\n\n\"The events which you have been charged happen over a number of years. Twelve, to be precise. Do you deny that they in fact took place?\"\n\n\"No. I do not.\"\n\n\"What defence do you have to your actions?\"\n\n\"Insanity. Caused by medication.\"\n\n\"Expand on this, please.\"\n\n\"For many years I had suffered from...\" Hitler's voice slowed to a halt.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Syphilis. I suffered from syphilis. I was prescribed for many years that I should take a concoction made of mercury to cure it. I tried for all my adult life. I have recently been informed that this could be the reason for what I did. However, I have no recollection of these events, only vague feelings of making decisions.\"\n\n\"When did you take these pills? At what points during the day?\" The defence lawyer prompted.\n\n\"Every time before making important decisions. My maid would remind me because I would always forget and she would always meet with me before I went to visit the fellow leaders of Germany.\"\n\nThe trial wore on. More questions were asked. My initial adrenaline rush faded, cold beads of sweat no longer coursed down my back, tickling my skin. I became bored with the proceedings. Witnesses were called. Mostly Jews, mostly sixty plus years old, transported the same way as Hitler, promised to be returned safe and sound.\n\nThe jury's hatred was tangible. What they assumed was justice was calling to them. But it was obvious it wasn't justice, it was and could only ever be hateful vengeance. Hitler could never, ever receive a fair trial. He knew this. The defence lawyer knew this. The judge knew this. everyone in the court knew this. And they proceeded anyway. It would have been better for Hitler if they had allowed him to die. But they had to \"Bring him to justice\". Not let him \"End things on his own terms\". He ends up dead either way.\n\nEnd dead he became. The jury filed out, and several minutes later filed back in. Hitler's head was buried in his hands. His lawyer vaguely patted his back.\n\n\"Guilty,\" came the verdict. No other verdict would ever have been given.\n\nHitler was lead out. Public executions had been illegal in every country in the world, apparently. An exception had obviously been made for Hitler.\n\nAn iron chair was fastened on a large wooden platform, which Hitler was fastened to. A small jerk, an audible moan, and he was dead.\n\nI know some of you reading will get a lot of satisfaction from reading this. Hitler was executed! The world is better! But it didn't end as some of you would have hoped. He had a painless death. He would otherwise have had his brains blown out, painfully lingering on the moment of death. He might have missed a little, and bleed to death. But no, a wave of pure death ended him instantly. Not to over use the cliche, but, he died, not with a bang, but with a whimper.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEdit: typo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402165757", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Part 2**  - Doing updates in reverse order this time, like I should have in the first post.  Most recent is now at the top.\n\n-------\n\n* 5:16 - [*Please look forward to it.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) [End of Presentation]\n\n* 5:14 - Parting remarks - Where should fans look for the next big reveals?  Do they have to wait super long?  Maybe tune back in for more at E3? - Yoshi P laughing because this question wasn't on the script (improvised by Bayohne).  Rest of E3 is mostly on 2.3; Fanfest will also have lots of big stuff too.  In-game bonuses for Fan-fest tickets most likely.  New information will be forthcoming.\n\n* 5:12 - Possibilities of different hud settings/presets, ex. based on class/role? - System-wise they can do it, and it's on the task list, but it's a lot of work to do.  It may take a bit, but they definitely want to get it done.\n* 5:09 - Duty Finder &amp; Chocobos - Yoshi P face onto desk at this question and making whining sounds.  They know players really want to be able to queue with their chocobo out, and/or use their chocobo in dungeons, but it's a huge hurdle for them systems-wise.  They're trying a lot of different options to see if they can get it to work, but they're worried it's such a big change they may have to temporarily stop content creation while they get it in place.  Regardless, it's coming, just ETA on it is a bit in flux while they try to find the right way/time to get it to work.\n\n* 5:06 - Is there any future purpose planned for the EX Primal tokens (Rowena Tokens)? - For 2.3, nothing is planned for them.  In the future, there will be more Primal battles/etc. though, so maybe they can find some way to use them in the future?  They said don't worry about collecting a pile of them or hanging onto them forever though, anything they do with them is a long way away, if ever.\n\n* 5:04 - Will Relics ever visually change? - Yes, the step after Novus will have more significant visual changes to Relic weapons.  Eventually, there will be a 'final' version of relic weapons; that truly represents the original/ancient 'Zodiac Braves' weapon.\n\n* 5:02 - PvP/Dueling/Frontline - Not really thinking about duels as a major system; don't really feel like it could be made into something that's really very fun.  They do want to at least find some basic way to include a dueling method to at least gauge each other's PvP prowess and statistics etc.  (Kind of a weird response.)\n\n* 4:59 - Marriage System Info - Lots of stuff for 2.3(4? I didn't hear clearly) planned.  Is going to be open to any two players, regardless of race, region, gender, etc.  After discussion, the Dev team felt like there should be no restrictions on it in Eorzea.  Considering special mount(s) for married couples, possibly a two-person mount.\n\n* 4:58 - Roaming Primals - What about the idea of roaming/capturable FC summons in the overworld that was originally planned back before release?  Haven't canned the idea.  It's still on their plate, but they want to find a way to make it actually feel good in the lore/story, not just spontaneously be a giant wandering Ifrit.\n\n* 4:54 - Airships / FC Airships - They haven't forgotten about them.  Yoshi P holding up a concept art piece of an estate basement/airship engineering bay.  How do they fit in your basement?  Magic.  Once you release it out of your basement it becomes full size.  Airship scale is actually shown in the image with a little tiny white outline of a person.  Airships are huge.  Airships are intended to be an investment/task a whole FC can get behind.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402433740", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "score": 85, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Similar situation, but in 11th grade.\n\nOur final exam was to draw a map of the world.  From memory.  I didn't study for it, but we did spend all semester talking about history and countries and stuff, so I felt I had a pretty decent idea where most of the relevant countries were.  On the day of the exam, the teacher allowed us to look at a world map for 5 minutes, then we would take the exam for the rest of the period, where he handed each of us a large sheet of paper and a set of colored pencils.\n\nNow I should preface this by mentioning that this particular teacher was very anal-retentive.  The smallest imperfections in any assignments we turned in often resulted in points lost, no matter if it was grammar, punctuation, spelling, harsh handwriting, etc.  He often belittled the students if they answered a question wrong.  So, as a result, I didn't take any of his classes seriously.\n\nI used the relevant 5 minutes to look at the map, then spent the first 10 minutes of the exam with my eyes closed.  Then, I drew a perfect map of the world.  Countries, capitals, lines of latitude and longitude, lakes, seas, oceans, islands, everything.  Even my handwriting looked like I had taken lessons in cartography.  The coloring was impeccable.  When the teacher allowed another 5 minutes to look at the map, I continued drawing and coloring without looking.  The teacher had an impressed look on his face as I masterfully busted out a perfect copy of a world map, which was reflected in the perfect grade I received for it.\n\nThere was a small school ceremony as my map was framed and hung in the school's main lobby, next to a copy of the Mona Lisa and some Picasso painting.
