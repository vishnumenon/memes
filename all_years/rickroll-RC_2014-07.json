Back then I guess we were really friends.  When nobody else gave enough shits about me to wait through a buffer or even send me a goddamned gif, you had my back you son of a bitch.  Is it the Vines?

What has become of this world?\"  *cries so hard blood comes out* \"just go.  I can't handle this anymore.\"\n\n3 months later he was surfing the web and he got an email notification.  It was a YouTube link.  \"Who was it from?\" he wondered.  \"Oh. Him.\"  He reluctantly opened it.  The video was 1 minute 34 seconds long.  By the 1 minute mark, he was howling with laughter.  As the video faded out and the recommended videos popped up, his mind settled on the fact that his friend was trying to make amends.  He didn't harbor any ill will towards his friend and all he wanted when breaking off the relationship was for him to wake up and realize he was changing for the worse.  He emailed back: \n\n\"Hey, man.  I just saw the video.  That was... fucking hilarious actually.  I don't even know what to say.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long while.  Neil kind of just quit sending me videos a while back.  I'd like to get together with you soon and maybe have a few beers.  You know, watch a few Fail Compilations like the good old days?  \n\nBut I've got to admit something... This is hard to tell you, but I started watching Vines about a month ago.  At first it was just Vine compilations on YouTube.  I know, I know.  That's the first mistake everyone makes.  As you know, the quality of those are not great, but they are the best thing Vine has to offer.  I didn't realize that and when I started using Vine, the quality of the content I was watching just plummeted.  I've been scraping by on a few racial joke videos a day just to keep myself going.  Buddy, I know I wasn't there for you when you needed me most.  But I'm afraid of what will happen if I can't get out of this situation.  I need your help or I don't think I can make it.  I know this is a lot to put on you.  I understand if you want nothing to do with me.\"\n\nMinutes turned to more minutes as he anxiously waited for a response.  His shaking hand nudged the mouse as he searched for a quick Vine.  *Boo doop* an email notification popped up.  He opened it immediately.  There was only a link in the body of the message.  *click*.  He held his breath and waited for the video to start.

I thought we were doing well. A few rough hiccups aside, there was truly a lot to hope for.\n\nIt was strange walking into the United Nations general assembly. I've been here before... but never in an official capacity. But this... this... was a little too much for simple UN representatives to handle.\n\n\"They're arguing again\" Angela said, half in disgust half in exasperation. \n\n\"What did you expect?\" Russia was first. A test? It proved to be a successful one. \"If that stubborn fool Putin had informed the world what they were dealing with maybe he wouldn't have to be here yelling.\"\n\n\"I suppose..\" She trailed off. Likely as drained as I am.\n\n\"I will have all of you settle down! This in-fighting is getting us nowhere.\" Ban Ki-moon was leading the deliberations. A good man. Not much charisma but he's one of the best administrators around. \"Gates wants the terms of our surrender by 8 tomorrow and we've made no progress. There's so little discuss, we've been left with no choice.\"\n\nHe was right. In this age of technology it's hard to be surprised that everything started with a tweet. A simple practical joke, brought back from the stone ages of the internet, to play on friends that went viral at an ungodly speed. Michelle sent it to me. I sent it to the girls. All in good fun. The trick was that you had to both send and receive it for the program to get into your finances. That's how we went so long without catching it.\n\n\"The only money he didn't get a hold of was from those interested in or unable to use the internet. He has us all by our bloody purse strings!\" Cameran. A little over dramatic but he's not wrong.\n\n\"Is he really asking for so much?\" Of course, it would be Mark Rutte. \"A unified world government? Global subsidized healthcare? An end to wars and genocides? Na regen komt zonnenschijn.\"\n\n\"Obama\" Putin, respectful as always. \"Where do you stand?\"\n\n*sigh*\n\n\"I stand where I always do, on the side of change. We must forget our prides and look to the future. Bill has proven before, although extreme this time, his heart is in the right place. We should surrender to his care, and provide as much support as we can in the times to come. The collective view isn't wrong... we really have no choice.\"\n\nThe most frustrating thing, far and beyond everything else...
