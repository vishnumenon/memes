This struck me as odd because I had that one guy who worked at home and was always on the computer. I didn't assume anything out of the usual, I just thought maybe they went out or something. I took off my backpack and turned on the TV and it immediately went to that damn emergency setting due to a flood warning. I then over and saw a shadow standing perfectly still. I thought maybe it was one of my friends, but when I called to him, he didn't respond. I then walked over to this odd shadow fellow. I walked up to him, but even with the lights on, this man was still shrouded in shadows. I tried to stay calm, but then he turned around to me.... and.... said those...

{"body": "Tell me about it. There was this one time where a mining company of in my small town had to dispose of truck loads of old explosives (tnt or whatever), and they did end up contacting the city, and by city I mean Sheriffs dept. The local Sheriff and deputies thought it'd be a good idea to stack it up on rafts and push them into the middle of a flooded rock quarry pit and take turns shooting at it. [rock quarry pic for reference](http://imgur.com/QdhqUM6) \n\nThe Sheriffs dept didn't end up telling anyone else about the ordeal; citizens, mayor, anything.  It would have been good fun, had they taken into the account the fact that the explosives were old and were leaking flammable liquid all over the place.  They stacked some of the explosives on a raft, and nudged it into towards the middle of the rock pit. In doing so they ended up splashing a bunch of water on the pile and raft, so there is a bit of concern if it'll go up once in the middle. \n\nThe mascot for my highschool football team was actually out there, Chief Kick-em-butt ( I couldn't make that name up if I tried), who was also a friend of mines dad. He was really into the Native American history and would come out onto the field with homemade spears and the like. Our team name was the Chiefland Indians.  Anyways, he was close with the Sheriffs dept., his brother was a cop in Gainesville for the University of Florida. \n\nThe Sheriff and deputies start unloading on the two floating stacks of explosives but nothing happens, very anticlimactic. My friends dad, Chief kick-em-butt, pulls out a bow and ignites some of the arrows he usually would use the halftime show at football games. This dudes a crack shot. Nails the first stack right in the middle, but it doesn't blow. Instead, it engulfs in flames. \n\nThen something weird happens. A ribbon of fire is snaking its way across the water towards the shore. The cops and my buddies dad don't really see it at first, not until it was too late. The explosives on the raft were too wet to combust, but the liquid seeping out was impervious to the water, and so immediately caught flame and ignited the trail of liquid that leading from the raft to the shore, across the water, and straight towards the dry explosives stacked on the shore. \n\nThe explosion was so great that it shattered windows half a mile away and shook peoples trailers (trailer park trailers) of their cinder block supports.  8 of the 10 guys there were pretty much vaporized, including my buddies dad and some of the mining personnel. There was a whole thing in the paper about it, and how if they only would have told others about what they were doing, someone would have stopped them. \n\nThe other 2 guys who ended up surviving were up on the top of the pit. They were both in the hospital for a long time in comas, burnt up and hit with rock debris from the explosion. No one knew what happened for like 6 months.  There was talk about it having been a terrorist attack and everything. Once the guys came to, they explained everything, and that they had been recording everything from the top of the pit when it happenend, which is why they were probably still alive. Nobody believed them at first, and thought maybe even the 2 survivors had planned to kill those other guys for some reason or another. \n\nThe guys ended up taking their camera to some specialist who pulled the data off the damaged SD card, and turned it over. The whole recording apparently wasn't able to be recovered, but about the last 2 minutes or so was, including the explosion. You can see the trail of fire heading from the raft towards the shore and briefly catch a glimpse of the mens panic once they realize what is about to [happen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) NSFL", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408255581", "subreddit": "GlensFalls", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If there is someone on the team who is being a maximum dookybag, say ( I do it over voice chat so they can hear a cool, collected non snarky tone ) 'I'm have to mute you [teal], I won't have negativity in my game.' And then ( possibly the hardest part for some) mute him.  Don't be that guy that doesn't mute to they can continue to have shit talked at them, you don't need that.  \n\nAlso I encourage my team to be not bad mannered.  The number of 'omg that is not bad manner I only said get rekt' is astounding and I truly believe that the majority of the people don't even realize how toxic they are being when they say even innocuous-ish things like 'lol' in all chat when a tide misclicks and blows his ult for example.  Don't press the issue if they say that, I'm still learning the best way to deal with these situations, I've gotten the best results so far from saying something like 'imagine you were that nyx, if you missed that easy stun would you want the enemy to say 'bye lol' in all chat as he tps away?' And then LEAVE IT AT THAT.  Letting them to think on has gotten me a surprising amount of 'sorry I called you a returd' at the end of the game.  If they continue, mute them.\n\nNow when the game is over,  I'm still not sure what is Best Practice to say.  I think it is 'ty for game gg' and either some sort of compliment to a specific player if it was a close game, or nothing if it was a blowout ( blowout wins make compliments seem insincere, and no one other team needs to know they did good when they wrecked you.)\n\nI read the short story ['The Egg'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) about once a week, I think it keeps me a bit less wrathful than I normally would be.
