{"body": "Welcome back to days 13-14 of the Tellius draft!\n\n[Last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/2fc8g3/everyone_plays_fire_emblem_days_1112/ck7w462)\n\nDraft Members: Titania/Mist, Nephenee, Mia, Elincia, Brom, Fiona, Ranulf, Calill/Largo, Ulki, Ena/Nasir, Gareth\n\nChapter 18 - [Zelda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) – New People!\n\nChapter 19 - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) – Death by Windy Ravens\n\nChapter 20 - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) – How did that happen?\n\nIke - Level 7 Lord\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 42 | 24 | 12 |21 | 20 | 14 | 18 | 10\nAverage Stats | 42 | 21 | 8 | 21 | 23 | 15 | 18 | 12\nStat Difference| 0 | +3 |  +4 | 0 | -3 | -1 | 0  | +2\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 26 | 20 | 27 | 28 | 40 | 24 |22 \n\nThoughts – Finally Ike has promoted, meaning he can now gain more speed! It seems his strength has gone up again, which means he will do incredible Aethers \n\nTitania - Level 13 Paladin\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 38 | 19 | 7 | 23 | 19 | 16 | 17 | 10\nAverage Stats | 43 | 17 | 7 | 20 | 20 | 16 | 16 | 12\nStat Difference| -5 | +2 | 0 | +3 | -1 | 0 | +1  | -2\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 25 | 20 | 26 | 27 | 40 | 27 | 26\n\nThoughts – Wow... How is it that you fail to get HP so many times? Geez. Otherwise not much else to say, gained some more strength, which is nice, and some more defence\nMia - Level 10 Swordsmaster\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 44 | 18 | 5 | 24 | 26 | 16 | 15 | 11\nAverage Stats | 37(+7) | 17 | 9  | 22 | 27 | 16| 14 | 10\nStat Difference| 0 | +1 | -4 | +2 | -1 | 0 | +1  | +1\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 22 | 20 | 29 | 30 | 40 | 22 | 25\n\nThoughts – For some reason, Mia has very low magic. Not that it matters. A +1 in strength is pretty good, and +2 skill is a nice touch. She currently has very nice dogde, which is cool.\n\nMist - Level 1 ~~HORSEMAGE~~ Valkyrie\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 29 | 13 | 19 | 10| 17 | 20 | 8 | 18\nAverage Stats | 29 | 10 | 18 | 10 | 18 | 17 | 8 | 17\nStat Difference| 0 | +3 | +1 | 0 | -1 | +3 | 0 | 0\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 20 | 26 | 24 | 26 | 40 | 20 | 29\n\nThoughts – Mist Is quite the character. Having gained her pony ~~for christmas~~, Mist is now able to be an effective, fast healer. Magic and strength being up is a great bonus, which means she can heal AND deal decent amounts of damage. Horray!\n\nBrom - Level 9 General\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 45 | 27 | 5 | 25 | 22 | 8 | 26 | 9\nAverage Stats | 46 | 22 | 5 | 21 | 14 | 8 | 25 | 10\nStat Difference| -1 | +5 | 0 | +4 | +8 | 0 | +1  | 0\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 29 | 20 | 27 | 24 | 40 | 30 | 25\n\nThoughts –  Yay Brom! Brom is turning into one of my best units! Having insane amounts of speed and strength, Brom is going to kill all in his way, without any harm. One of my better ideas was giving Brom the Provoke skill... I am glad I did. He know takes all hits like a champ, and no one else gets hurt...\n\nNephenee - Level 8 Halberdier\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 39 | **25** | 7| 24| 25 | 12 | 21 | 9\nAverage Stats | 37 | 18 | 7 | 23 | 24 | 11 | 18 | 10\nStat Difference| +2 | +7 | 0 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +3  | -1\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 25 | 20 | 28 | 26 | 40 | 28 |25 \n\nThoughts – Holy fuck Nephenee, you've capped your strength..... +7 in strength is silly ridiculous.... Defense is up rather high also, along with almost everything else... You see why I like her?\n\nUlki – Level 8 Hawk - **NEWCOMER**\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 42 | 16 | 4 |14 | 13 | 10 | 14 | 9\nAverage Stats | 44 | 16 | 4 | 15 | 13 | 10 | 14 | 9\nStat Difference| -2 | 0 |  0 | -1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0\nMaximum Stats | 65 | 26 | 20 | 35 | 36 | 40 | 26 |26\n\nThoughts – Our first laguz! Unfortunatly, Laguz are not as good in this game as the next one. As a positive, the demi band is more vaible in this game then its equivelent in the next game. In PoR, Laguz rarely cap stats, with the exception for strength and HP, which have a slight chance of capping. Currently, Ulki has almost average stats, with a few points off in the HP and Skill.\n\n\nCallil – Level 9 Sage - **NEWCOMER**\n\n|| HP | Str | Magic | Skill | Speed | Luck | Defense | Resistance\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nCurrent Stats| 33 | 9 | 21 |20 | 19 | 18 | 9 | 19\nAverage Stats | 34 | 9 | 20 | 19 | 19 | 17 | 9 | 18\nStat Difference| -1 | 0 |  +1 | +1 | 0 | +1 | 0  | +1\nMaximum Stats | 60 | 25 | 30 | 28 | 28 | 40 | 20 |28 \n\nThoughts – We have our first sage! Callil is a decent unit, who can take care of units fairly easily. Her usefulness is let down by the fact that she cannot use staves in this game...(stupid knives...) Otherwise Callil has average stats, having a slight gain in magic and skill. Callil will be one of our major characters in both games!\n\nUnfortunatly, due to the new school I will be unable to continue the picture updates. I will continue to update, now that I have the average stats, but you will have to use your imagination", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409952101", "subreddit": "fireemblem", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I just run \"mpv http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" or whatever in the console and it plays. `mpv` has much more performant software video decoding, and the hardware accelerated video decoding is enabled by default, unlike in chromium. (note: many youtube videos are VP8, which isn't supported by a particularly wide variety of video cards. My Ivy Bridge doesn't support it.)\n\nAlso, I get sane controls for fast forwarding and rewinding. There are no ads. It also buffers as fast as my internet connection will allow, which is nice.\n\nI watch a hell of a lot more youtube videos now.\n\n`mpv` is a fork of `mplayer2` which is a fork of `mplayer`. It might not be available on all distros, but you can use [`quvi`](http://quvi.sourceforge.net/) to download a youtube link as a video file. You can do the same thing with browser extensions in Windows of course. But it's a two step process: download then watch, so `mpv` is a lot more convenient.\n\n*****\n#Unrelated rant:\n\nLinux doesn't have a killer feature. And it has some rough edges. It also has uncountably many teeny, tiny improvements over, say, Windows or OSX. Each of these improvements, such as the expectation that if youtube makes a shitty interface for watching videos, it's expected that someone somewhere out there builds youtube support into a video player, each of them by themselves are pretty meaningless. But when you take the sum of them, it's just such a wonderfully better experience as a whole. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410918751", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The French Army entered Amsterdam on the 19 January 1795 to stay there over winter. Well informed, the general found out that a Dutch fleet was anchored at Den Helder, approximately eighty kilometers north from Amsterdam. The ongoing winter was extremely cold, so much so that the rivers and seashores were frozen solid. General of Brigade Jean-Guillaume de Winter was ordered by Pichegru to take the head of a squadron of the 8th Hussar. This Dutchman was fighting along with the French since 1787, and would later command the Dutch fleet in the Battle of Camperdown. He arrived at Den Helder with his troops during the night of the 23 January 1795. The Dutch fleet was there as planned, trapped by ice. Each hussar had brought on his horse an infantryman of the 15th Line Infantry Regiment.\n\n&gt; After a very careful approach to avoid awakening the Dutch sailors, Lieutenant-Colonel Louis Joseph Lahure launched the assault. The ice did not break up, and the Dutch ship were boarded by the cavalry that managed to get on the decks.\n\n&gt; **Result**\nThe French Army captured 14 ships of the line and 880 guns.
