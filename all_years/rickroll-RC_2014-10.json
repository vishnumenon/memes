{"body": "I apologize in advance for the wall of text, but here goes nothing...\n\nI started looking into internet dating after my 3rd failed *serious* relationship.  I've been around the block a few times, but at this point I'm just looking to hook up.  Not the type of guy to rebound and try internet dating, but a couple of my buddies of had a lot of success, and I *need* a rebound.  Soooo &lt;insert popular dating app&gt;, here I am. Set up profile, sit back, play some vidja games.  My life goes on.\n\nA few weeks go by.  I get a couple messages from some randos... cute, but no thanks.  I don't know what I'm saving myself for, but I wait for some reason.  Then I get to talking to this one girl... she noticed that I put \"Princess Bride\" under fav movies in my profile, and she's a huge fan.  Bingo!\n\n&gt; SIDENOTE: Hey, if you don't like The Princess Bride, fuck you.  That shit is a masterpiece. \n\nAnywho, one thing leads to another, and I ask her for a pic.  Nothing crazy, I just want to see what she looks like ([Can she fit in a rowboat?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SricpmKQd3U)) (Not that there's anything wrong with that, just not my cup of tea.)  Well, she sends one and... holy shit.  8.5, 9/10 easy.  I'm kind of funny, can hold my own in a conversation, been hitting the gym lately... about a 7/10.  Looking like I hit the goldmine.  I send her a pic back, compliments are flying every which way, and we agree to go out for coffee.\n\nFAST FORWARD: Date night.  I'm nervous.  Originally I just wanted to hook up with a chick, but this girl is really, really cool.  I don't want to screw this up.  I take a look in the mirror: looking as fresh as can be for a coffee date, I have pants on, good to go.  I head out.\n\nWell we meet up and I can already tell I'm falling for this girl.  Insane right?  But I figure I've been here before.  I'm no stranger to love.  So I just play it cool.  We start talking about movies, and of course Princess Bride comes up, and we sort of start talking about True Love (a major theme in the book and movie).  Well, this of course, leads to us talking about exes, and here's where things get interesting.\n\nTurns out her ex is a grade A BITCH.  In a scene straight out of How I Met Your Mother, she admits to me that she was actually engaged... but he got cold feet and took off.  He lied to her about being late to the reception, gave her the run around, then just... never... showed... up.\n\nWell by the time she finished the whole story, she's in tears, and I *feel* for her.  I understand what it's feels like to never be appreciated, to invest so much time and effort into a relationship, only to watch it all fall apart and crumble.  It hurts man, it fucking hurts.  So without even thinking about what I was doing, I slide over to her side of the table, put my arms around her and just hug her for a minute while she cries.  Then I whispered into her ear:\n\nWe're no strangers to love.  You know the rules and so do I...A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.  You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just... wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand.\n\nNever gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you\"\n\n\n**TL;DR** If you want to get laid, follow [these simple steps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n**EDIT:** Formatting.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413410860", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The NBA is currently in partnership with the  Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) and we are considering a league wide education program to educate players on the dangers of sexually threatening contact. RAINN considered Thompsons behavior inappropriate and we wholeheartedly agree. As part of the league wide initiative commisstioner Silver has placed Thompson on a conditional suspension and reeducation program which will be lifted once all conditions of the suspension are met.**\n\nThe conditional suspension program, which is based on his completion of a sexual assault education program which is funded through RAINN, was applauded by both victims of domestic violence and women's liberation groups. \n\n[ESPN video discussing the issue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413658429", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If I'm correct, downloading only audio from youtube is possible because youtube uses [DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) streaming. Video and audio are available in different qualities and formats that can be switched out as the video plays.\n\nThe idea is that your browser can swap out different versions of the video in real-time to respond to slowing or increasing network speeds.

{"body": "Kinda close, but not quite.  What happens on normal browsers, is the whole URL is sent to the Youtube server, and the server essentially says \"Hey, try looking over here instead\", and so the browser then instantly tries the other address.  Here's a copy/paste from some actual server communication:\n\n*Browser says:*\n&gt;    GET /watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ+ HTTP/1.1\n\n*Server says:*\n&gt;    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other  \n&gt;    Location: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n\n*Browser says:*\n&gt;    GET /watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ HTTP/1.1\n\n*Server says:*\n&gt;    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nAnd at that point, the server starts sending the actual web page for the video.  (And another set of GET-&gt;OK requests is made for each picture, part of the video, etc.)\n\nSo, why doesn't it work in all those apps?  Well, there's a good chance that the apps send the same content the browser does, but when it gets something back, the app simply looks for the video, and doesn't have code to understand the response properly (like a real browser would).  So the app will simply give up.\n\nIf that's not the case, there's another possibility.  The apps may rewrite the URL themselves (or perhaps pick it apart and use Youtube streaming API's or somesuch), and whatever form their request takes, is one where Youtube doesn't (and perhaps can't) do the same correction.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414799347", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
