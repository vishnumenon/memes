NightSlash makes memes about the /r/ultrahardcore subreddit. He has a relatively small channel with only 7 videos, but the quality of those 7 videos is amazing! All of his videos have over 1000 views and 2 of them even have over 2000 views! If you've started watching his videos, you'll never stop watching them, you'll just click that replay button over and over again! \nHere are some of the 'highlights' of his channel:\n\nA few days ago he made a video called [The Average Community Post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdA1l7Zxa6Y). If you read the community post often then you'll probably get a good laugh out of this video, especially with the really well done voices!\n\nHe also made a very funny compilation of uhc rage moments called [Ode to UHC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-zwc0Ih1ic). Make sure to lower your audio before watching this one!\n\nThen last but most certainly not least, his most viewed video with 2.581 views, [/r/ultrahardcore in a nutshell!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEF9aoBeL1Y) This video is about all the stereotypes of /r/ultrahardcore you come across every day. Though, please keep in mind that, as he says himself:\n\n&gt; Triggerwarning: This is an exaggeration\n\nThese were some of his best videos, but the other ones are also really good, so you should definitely go check him out on YouTube! NighSlash currently has 223 subscribers, but he deserves a lot more, so go subscribe to his channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/NightslashPlays\n\n*In UHC YouTuber of the week, every week, we feature a small UHC YouTube channel with good videos, who deserves more views and subscribers.

{"body": "Funny story actually.  I used to do a web based food film series on mobile vendors a few years back.  This was really before the food truck thing really gained so much popularity, so back then I just approached one of my regular halal guys.  He let me take over his cart and mess around in there for a while in return for a few bucks. It was actually pretty great and fairly informative.\n\nFast forward a few years, I'm doing another halal shoot, but this time more of a character role, much like what you're describing.  My halal guy isn't around any more and I hadn't made a new connection like the one I used to have so finding someone to let me take over and shoot was proving to be an issue.  Luckily, there is a street food vendors coalition (SFVCNYC) which was able to help me get in touch with someone who let me film in their cart for a reasonable fee.  Check out their site [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), more specifically the contact section and try to get in touch with Alice.

You came right up to me and asked what I had on my shirt, flicking me on the nose when I foolishly looked down. We have been together for most of our lives, you even convinced me to rent a place with you when we finally got into college.\n\nYou were always fun to be around. You always knew what to say, always knew how to make the best out of any situation. You were one of the most clever guys I knew and probably will ever know.\n\nI can't believe it happened. You left to go to some party, to go hang out with some friends while I was stuck at the house studying. \n\nYou call me in the middle of the night, except it isn't exactly you. Something is different, something is... wrong. \n\nYou explain to me what happend, how that drunk asshole crashed right into your car and walked away without a scratch while you were trapped inside, bleeding, until finally death came for you.\n\nOut of anyone in the world why the fuck did you have to call *me*? I am doing exactly as you told me to do. I went onto your computer, and went directly into your documents. \n\nYou said there is a folder in there called \"Tax Refund Information\", and inside that the folder that I needed to select the one labeled \"2013\". \n\nInside the folder you said there would be another folder, an invisible folder, which there was. You told me that was your \"stash\" and that I needed to delete it. Delete it to make sure no one would ever find it. You even warned me not to look inside.\n\nI couldn't help myself... *I had to know* what it is that you couldn't even show your friend. *Your best fucking friend in the whole fucking world.*\n\nInside you had a single file. Just a simple video file simply labeled \"My Will\".\n\nI *had* to click it, despite you telling me not to. I had to know what it was, despite you telling me to simply delete it. I had to see with my own eyes what you left behind.\n\n[God damn it Freddy.

{"body": "Ah, I think we're close to understanding each other. There are a couple of other things I'll point out, though. You may know these things, so I hope this doesn't seem condescending.\n\nFirst: If I put just a path in the URL for a Reddit comment, the domain is assumed to be reddit.com. So I can put things like \n\n    [Reddit's rules](/rules)\n    [The Mass Effect subreddit](/r/masseffect)\n\nand get \n\n\"[Reddit's rules](/rules)\"  \n\"[The Mass Effect subreddit](/r/masseffect)\"\n\nTherefore, if I spoiler something in the ordinary way\n\n    [this is a spoiler](/spoiler)\n\nI just get a link to reddit.com/spoiler, which does not exist.\n\nSecond: After I post a comment, what's displayed on the page is HTML, not Markdown. The CSS only 'sees' the page HTML - it never gets to look at Markdown. How I make that HTML is ultimately irrelevant; if I put www.reddit.com/spoiler you can see that it still gets spoilered. \n\nThe usual way of having spoilers on a subreddit is to have the CSS apply the spoiler behavior to links to reddit.com/spoiler. In the case of this sub, it's actually just applied to any link whose path ends with /spoiler. Because of this, I can add the fragment '#/spoiler' to most URLs, which doesn't change the actual behavior of the URL, but indicates to the CSS that I want that link to be spoilered.\n\nExample: [This link is a rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ#/spoiler \"Rickroll\")  \nwhich is the result of `[This link is a rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ#/spoiler \"Rickroll\")`\n\nAgain, any link in this sub, whether it's in the title, the sidebar, or a comment is treated this way. If the OP had made a text post, the title would not have been spoilered by the CSS. Of course, I'm still not sure what drove our darling OP to use the URL he did - reddit.com/spoiler would have given the same results with less effort.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417217039", "subreddit": "masseffect", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
