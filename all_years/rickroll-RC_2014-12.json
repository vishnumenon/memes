{"body": "Madness! Clawed from our minds, sanity has fled! Madness! We speak to the deaf! Madness! Begging for the past while hoping for a future! Madness indeed...\n\n\nI keep seeing it, all through KC, there is constant banter about the past. It was a great time, I've looked to the old ways many a time. And now, I will do my best to bring back the grandiose, the creativity, and the general happiness that once was.\n\n\nI know for a fact /u/GhostOfWhatsIAName loved the old days, and I also know how much I want not just to see them, but to live those days. I hope this case helps all of you see what was and, hopefully, what will be again!\n\n---\n\n\n*bursting through the court room doors, /u/iolpiolp8 wastes no time in taking the court room floor*\n\n\nThank you all for being here! I'd like to thank my mother, my catfish Rascal, Tom Petty....\n\n\n\n*/u/GhostOfWhatsIAName tackles /u/iolpiolp8 before he can further make a fool of himself, then whispers something in his ear*\n\n\nWhat the hell do you mean I'm not accepting an award??\n\n\n*more whispering*\n\n\nOh... Ummm... Shit. I had a speech prepared for the case, but I seem to have brought a different one.... I've never won an award... Why the fuck did I write this??\n\n\nI guess I'll just... Gentlemen of this fine establishment, beautiful women (and ugly ones I guess), thank you for joining me today in court. Today is a very special day, as I am reborn. You see, on my way here, I died from pure disbelief as to what the accused has done. But, I was reborn (and aged at an extremely sped up rate) for a reason. That reason was to see this man pay for his crimes.\n\n\n/u/rickrocketed is just a man, but he is also in the wrong. I won't sit here and try to tell you he's evil, or he stinks, or looks just like [Rick Astley]( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ ), because that would be unfair. I have seen his crimes in past instances, so to verbally abuse his his character would help nothing. It would seem we have an endemic, and he got caught up in it. Does this excuse his behavior? Absolutely not, he must pay for his crimes. But try to feel pity for him, as he is merely imitating what he sees those around him do.\n\n\nYou see, this is the 3rd case in such a short amount of time that someone has failed to deliver. First, we had /u/crisothetank (what up again, you're in my examples a lot) failing to drink pubes, then there was /u/lonelyboyisme not eating a sock (I did it, chicken shit, and I'm still alive! SHOCKER!). So it's understandable how /u/rickrocketed would think it to be ok to follow suit.\n\n\nHe stated he would eat horse semen if he received Reddit Gold. And of course, if you make such claim on reddit, people are bound to make it happen. As with the other two liars, it came to pass! He received gold! But, also like the other two, he never came through. \n\n\nWhile normally, claims like this are given time before the maker of the claim is labeled a liar. But most people don't go into lounge bragging about how they cheated someone out of their precious metals...

I feel this may be the only way he'll see the his faults and truly atone for his crime.\n\n\nWe must also find a way to stop this in the future... What if your children all become liars? All because little /u/rickrocketed lied. We must end this chain here and meow! Thank you...\n\n\n*starts somersaulting, going out the court doors and straight into a fountain.

{"body": "**Chapter Four** \n\nAnd so down he went, unhooked the station's metal panels and placing them to the side. He groaned as he did so, to really show his dissatisfaction with his personal choices. \n\nNo one else cared to listen or even pay heed to his actions. They were simply programmed to monitor their own monitors and respond to queries if need be. \n\nAndy1013 had found the cable line running from the monitor. It was an old VGA cable, he realized. An antique! It was short, and led him to a small black box that sat very quietly. It almost said, \"Hey, leave me alone!\" But that's silly, because black boxes can't talk. And if they did, poor Andy1013 might go into total power failure! Andy1013 jiggled the cable, and touched the black box. It had no reaction. He turned it around. \n\n*Curious* he thought to himself. He began running operational diagnostics, and found what he was looking for. A manual describing antique operation instructions. He reached around and found the mouse and keyboard. Plugging them in and taking them out of the small enclosure as he stood back up, he sighed again, this time with a sense of pride. \n\nNo one cared. \n\nHe hit a button on the keyboard. \n\nThe monitor changed. From a slideshow of images of humanoids - mostly small ones - all smiling. Oddly, they did not look anything like the small android models that Andy1013 had seen before in the databases. The monitor changed to a white background with many words on the screen. A small black window sat in the center of the screen, with an arrow pointing to the right. \n\nAndy1013 moved the mouse to navigate. Input recognition was so slow he almost gave up. But Andy1013 had never given up on his monitors before and he wouldn't now. Slowly, the mouse navigated over the black window.

{"body": "Credentials? Am I to assume you want me to provide some proof of authority?\n\nThat's... a fairly unique approach.\n\nI criticize because there is a set of blatantly false assumptions.  As a Psychologist (I'm doing my postgrad) I need to be very aware of self-deceptions. It's not a huge problem for most people, usually these are self-protective rather than self-destructive, but it's still really obvious once you've studied it for a while.\n\nPeople don't see the world objectively, and frequently we use various non-truths to back up a view of ourselves and actions as positive.\n\nFor example, you would have a *very* hard time accepting that you just asked for an argument from authority, if your username is anything to go by.  I suspect that you won't take that request back, and will instead come up with a variety of creative re-interpretations and post hoc explanations of what you meant in order to maintain a consistent self-identity.\n\nEDIT: I also found the following link that I believe should demonstrate just how useless most [business owners are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418541546", "subreddit": "australia", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It has come to the attention of internet users that Redditors, particularly /r/funny subscribers, recently traumatized by editorialized news headlines and vague threats over humorous films, have grown too jaded to approach this topic with rational discourse and fair analysis. Callous attitudes promote a culture of insensitivity, which ultimately leads to the exploitation of minorities and other groups. I am not among these groups, and as a white male I am privileged to be able to isolate my own biases from the social trends which jeopardize the funniness of /r/funny. That is not the case for many of my fellow subscribers.\n\nI do not know if you have browsed the front page recently. I do know, however, that the /r/funny moderators have done very little, if anything, to mitigate the daily (and minute-by-minute) stream of disparaging sarcasm and negativity of new submissions and comments. New Redditors and other lurkers are subscribed to /r/funny by default, and may not have the navigational skills to remove such comments from their main page. Experienced users may feel impacted by the dismissive and violent comments as well, but not to the same degree, as they can tailor their subscriptions to areas of interest and focus their attention elsewhere.\n\nI am asking that you create a policy to protect users who are unable, either technically, intellectually, or physically, from unwanted vitriol. 4Chan has already done this ([www.4chan.org/rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). If this trend were actually recognized by Reddit as low-effort and un-funny content, like memes or reaction gifs, I expect that the moderators would have already added it to the sub's official rules and banned users for violations. Just because sarcasm doesn't (seem to) threaten the very fabric of our society does not mean that it is not severely impacting subscribers and newcomers to Reddit. I know that you have the moderation powers to make this rule happen, and I am asking that you make the hard decision to protect the very essence of humor itself. We just want to laugh, and our happiness needs to be prioritized.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\n/u/sielingfan", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418884220", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Fair enough.\n\nWith the recent pandemic of ebola in the world, many scholars and scientists were actually relieved, citing the notion that we were \"long over due for a catastrophic illness,\" as can be seen in history to occur every so many generations.  Now as we all know, the ebola problem still lingers but is currently considered contained.  The scientists are no longer thinking that ebola is the sickness that will take out a large portion of the worlds population.  \n\nOne brave scientist, Dr. Sixtynine MaGoo P.hD.M.D.M.A., recently published an article in a highly regarded back page of the Playboy magazine stating that we are already unknowingly amidst the sickness that will in fact wipe out exactly 50% of the worlds people.  It's not an illness that makes you feel unhealthy, in fact there is no change at all to the way your body functions.  You simply, inexplicably, become a fucking cunt.\n\nBecumacunt Flu, as Dr. MaGoo has dubbed it, has been rampant in all cultures of the world for upwards of 100 years now, but with no changes in the bodies behavior, no one has been testing for it.  Yet every person on Earth has witnessed a countless number of times someone in the thralls of Becumacunt, and were dismissive of it.  Dismissive because Becumacunt has already affected 100% of the Earths population, and they too have already \"Becumcunted.\"\n\n\"So how is this a pandemic?\" you should fucking be asking yourself.  Well, when one person in the ravages of a Becumacunt fit happens to encounter someone else who is also in the ravages of a Becumacunt fit, a fatal outcome is currently predicted to happen 16% of the time.  This 16% will grow as more and more people Becumacunt until ultimately, one of the two people will end up dead.  Thus reaching the 50% mortality rate of the entire planet.\n\nIt will never surpass 50% though, because once 50% of the population dies, people will only die in units of 50% until there is only one human left.
