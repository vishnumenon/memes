You attempt to ctrl-alt-del, but nothing comes of it. The screen continues to blink red, filling the room with the harsh light. You reach for your phone, but it reads no service in the corner. Frowning, you set it back down on your desk and stare again at the screen\n\nTERRORIST ALERT. KEVIN RICHARDSON. CLASS 6. TERRORIST WATCH LIST SINCE 2015. TERRORIST ALERT.\n\nYou gulp, taking a drink of water. Is this something new, some sort of warning system against terrorist attacks you were unaware of? You attempt to click again, but nothing.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" you lean in closer as the words continue to flash on your screen. There is a loud crash and suddenly gas is filling your room. You begin to cough, waving your hand in the air to clear the smoke, but nothing works. You attempt to stand to get closer to the now broken window, but you feel a sudden blow to your head and everything goes black.\n\n-------\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\n\"Kevin Richardson, age 27, has been captured.

{"body": "Look at you. Big ass shades on, spikey-cool hair, iPod fuckin' blasting in your ears, radical pants, all while blowing those pretty octo-coil micro-coil cotton-pickin-built 0.0001 ohm clouds through a crowded public space. You're awesome, haha, not. Vaping is the newest and most annoying douchebaggery since glass packs on your hand me down 6cyl mustang. Here are some points I’d like to make.\n\n1) You didn’t quit smoking asshole, you are basically still smoking. Stop telling us your “quit date,” you basically are a cheater. You still puff nicotine, I’d sure F’ing hope you could “quit” cigs. These are like those boozers who say “I quit drinking” only to find out they still drink wine because that somehow doesn’t count.\n\n2) No one gives three shits about your clouds. Clouds are for the sky. Clouds are not for my coffee shop. Clouds in my coffee shop usually signifies some shit is burning down. And that’s never good. No one but you is impressed by your clouds. Are cam girls impressed by your cocksize also? Oh man, you must have the life!\n\n3) Stop saying “mod.” Its F’ing dumb. None of us even know what that means. Just say “battery.” Its a battery asshole. That’s all. I may start calling my watch battery my “time empower” now just to be a stupid asshole.\n\n4) If your vape shit taste like candy, you are a creepy shithead. If it taste like milk, you are disgusting. If you tell other people what it taste like, I hate you.\n\n5) Stop pissing on smokers. Some of you have become the Jehova’s Witnesses of addictions knocking on everyone’s door. Vaping is not a cult, not sure you got the message.\n\n\n6) Vapers are assholes.\n\n[Supporting document 1](http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/19/the-5-most-annoying-things-about-vaping-4953458/)\n\n[Supporting document 2](http://www.churnmag.com/features/9-ways-youre-probably-damaging-the-vaping-movement/)\n\n[Supporting document 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422394120", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; My gut feeling is, you had an app, you made a fair bit of money of it (or inherited a bit from your dad when he passed on), you used that $$ to buy a flashy car now you make $$ \"selling the dream\" to others.\n\nAhh, sheeeeht. You got me! This was my whole plan all along. To study four years of CSE to create one of the most downloaded apps in 2009 to make millions of dollars to buy a Lamborghini Aventador two years later in 2011 so that I can make a 11 second video four years after that in 2015 to try to get 2 people on Reddit to click my Facebook, then follow me for a few months, then somehow realize that I wrote a book back a few years ago because someone mentioned it in the comments, then decide to buy my book... which after Amazon and my publisher take their cut end up with $8 in profits... which doesn't even cover the cost of the gas used to make this video. But, it's all about that long con! Amirite, guys?\n\nAnyway, your whole argument falls apart because of any one of these three major points:\n\n1) Proceeds from my book are donated to charity. Or people can donate directly to charity and get my book for free.\n\n2) My book is not a \"get-rich-quick\" book. It's an autobiography of my family. There's even a whole chapter in the book denouncing get-rich-quick schemes. In fact, a part of the reason why I wrote this book was to counter all the scammers who were selling get-rich-quick books. I was getting tired of people getting scammed, I wanted to do something for charity, and I wanted to give people **real** advice. This book took care of all three.\n\n3) My book makes less than 1% of what I make from apps, even though the book took about 10 times longer to write than any of my apps did.  Observe:\n\nOpen up the App Store on your iPhone and look: #2 news app. Me. #3 news app. Me. #9 free news app. Me. #2 sports app. Me. #18 free utilities app. Me. Etc. Etc.\n\nNow open up Amazon and see where my book ranks: #722,377 in Books\n\nAny capitalist would look at this and say, \"Forget books. Stick with coding apps.\"\n\nAnd yes, thanks for pointing out that the Facebook/Instagram of a young gear head is full of pics of exotic cars and hot girls. I'm an exotic car and model photographer. So there's bound to be pics of exotic cars and models. What do you want me to post pictures of? Cats? What I ate for dinner? Selfies?\n\nAnyway, you're right about one thing, though. I post these pictures/videos to drive people to follow me on social media. Except the reason isn't to sell books. It's for Facebook/Instagram likes. Gimme likes. Me likey likes. Oh and for reddit karma. Ohh that sweet sweet karma. Actually, just internet points in general is what I want. After I hit a million points, I'm going to trade it all in one day for a 3D-printed dickbutt.\n\nBut, seriously, I do it because people enjoy my pics/vids.\n\nLet me prove it to you. Look at my submission history. My most upvoted photo was a drawing I made of Superman/Batman/Totoro/etc. on a sidewalk with a pressure-washer. I spent entire days drawing these. Why? Because I love making things that people enjoy. Are you going to say that I drew them to somehow sell books? Bitch, please.\n\nBy the way, why are you wasting so much time trying to vilify me?\n\n&gt; That said, I don't hate you for it, in fact I've thought about doing pretty much the same thing...\n\nOh, I see why. It's because you're projecting yourself onto me. But not everyone does things to earn a quick buck. Not everyone has a hidden agenda. Sorry, bud. But I'm not you.\n\n**tl;dr:** Buy my autobiography that I wrote in 2012, because an 11-second video of a two guys cursing somehow makes you want to go out and read a book. And since it's a bit hard to find a link to my book because I don't link to it anywhere in the video, [here's a direct link to it on Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).\n\nEdit: Typo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422525621", "subreddit": "cars", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Buzz Bullets. They aren't known for hucking because they don't score a lot of points with sweet full-field bombs, but they chew up tons of easy yards on smart, mid-range shots. Their hucks are generally short, blady, and cross field.\n\nBy throwing cross-field, they put the disc on the break-side of their receiver, minimizing the defense's ability to make a play. This normally necessitates throwing something closer to an OI or blade. OIs have little flight time, as well, further decreasing the defense's ability to make a play. Last, their huck choices are fairly conservative. You see more twenty-five to thirty-five yard puts to small windows than full-field bombs. Factor in the cross-field nature of the throw, and it might take two or more hucks to make it to the goal line. This is the perfect recipe for completing lots of hucks, and not being known as a 'hucking team'.\n\n[There's a more in-depth analysis of their game in this Ultiworld Article](http://ultiworld.com/2014/08/01/breaking-buzz-bullets/)\n\nAnd check out some of these sweet NGN games:\n\n[vs. Johnny Bravo WCC 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyE-B91FzO0)\n\n[vs. Sockeye WCC 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5JCGBLRPwM)\n\n[vs. Rhino WCC 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIhviMk6zOc)\n\nAnd this sweet SKYD coverage:\n\n[vs. Ironside WUCC 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gz19DtP8v8)\n\nAnd this sweet video of Phoenix upsetting them at World's that I just found:\n\n[vs. Phoenix WUCC 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422625118", "subreddit": "ultimate", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}
