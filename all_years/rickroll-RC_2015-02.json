{"body": "Yeah, bronies and muppets just don't mix. It has (and probably will be again) a big controversy in the brony community about it. The whole thing started in 2013 (ish) after one of the more prominent artists (Ezra Andrews, he's disappeared, sadly) in the brony community caught another artist (I forgot his name, sorry it's been a while) plagiarizing and selling his art. The other artist was actually an artist (I guess a lazy one though) and made quite a good bit of muppet pornographic art. Many of the well-known bronies began reporting and almost going on strike (? not sure what to call it) the other guy's art anywhere they found it. By the time the entire community found out they began doing the same and it somehow led to a feud between the muppets and the muppet community (fans of the plagiarizer's artwork especially).

{"body": "First off take /u/1mhotepp's advice (it works!, just take volunteers to start calling in detachments; reguardless of teir) here is a calling guide my friend made, it's easy to understand and was well received by the community: http://forum.worldoftanks.com/index.php?/topic/407627-theory-guide-to-calling/page__pid__8258739#entry8258739  \nMy clan uses wotmanager and gives out the attendance codes, each code is a ticket for a gold lottery. We also give out gold awards with \"medals\"  (special ts server group icons) to show appreciation for a player's outstanding contribution toward the clan. We take donation from our members to pay for teamspeak and raffles, you get thanked and awarded tickets in the raffle for X amount of $ donated. (Its totally donation based and that affects the time frame of raffles/awards but it works) We also have collected a bunch of gold from doing the CW map exhibitions. I really recommend participating in the exhibitions even if your not that good, it can really give you insight on how the map and top clans play. That guide was made for beginning calling, not too advanced but its all you need to start practicing. The author of that guide is a former member &amp; friend of our clan, he has taught our callers alot.  My clan is statisticly similar to SABOT, i even think my DCO has been looking for a scrimage partner when we have the time.

Señor Lujon himself\nwent out toward the servants' quarters to hurry the candidates for\nthe marriage sacrament.  The women were giggling and snatching up\ntheir best shawls.  Some of the men had even gashed their hands.\nThe household crowded into the sala, and Father Vaillant married\ncouples with great dispatch.\n\n\"To-morrow morning, the baptisms,\" he announced.  \"And the mothers\nsee to it that the children are clean, and that there are sponsors\nfor all.\"\n\nAfter he had resumed his travelling-clothes, Father Joseph asked\nhis host at what hour he dined, remarking that he had been fasting\nsince an early breakfast.\n\n\"We eat when it is ready--a little after sunset, usually.  I have\nhad a young lamb killed for your Reverence.\"\n\nFather Joseph kindled with interest.  \"Ah, and how will it be\ncooked?\"\n\nSeñor Lujon shrugged.  \"Cooked?  Why, they put it in a pot with\nchili, and some onions, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is the point.  I have had too much stewed mutton.

They quickly dispersed, leaving old Rosa\nby her fire-place, where hung a kettle from which issued the savour\nof cooking mutton fat, all too familiar to Father Joseph.  He found\na half sheep hanging outside the door, covered with a bloody sack,\nand asked Rosa to heat the oven for him, announcing that he meant\nto roast the hind leg.\n\n\"But Padre, I baked before the marriages.  The oven is almost cold.\nIt will take an hour to heat it, and it is only two hours till\nsupper.\"\n\n\"Very well.  I can cook my roast in an hour.\"\n\n\"Cook a roast in an hour!\" cried the old woman.  \"Mother of God,\nPadre, the blood will not be dried in it!\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it!\" said Father Joseph fiercely.  \"Now hurry\nwith the fire, my good woman.\"\n\nWhen the Padre carved his roast at the supper-table, the serving-\ngirls stood behind his chair and looked with horror at the delicate\nstream of pink juice that followed the knife.

In fact it is a pretty blatant example of compositional video editing, where two separate shots are edited to look like the same shot i.e the guy jumping on the road and the car driving on the road.\n\nA car moving at that velocity would be pushing out a serious amount of air and if you look at the clothes of the guy jumping they move in a completely unilateral matter (vertical only, in line with his jumping) showing no signs of the massive turbulent force that has supposedly gone underneath him.\n\nSecondly, There is quite clearly digital artefacts left where the two images have been 'stitched' together, put the video on 1080p and look closely around the guy as he jumps, I found focusing on his right arm makes this easiest to spot.\n\nIn short, this video is a fake and I for one am glad, it would have been a monumentally stupid undertaking and after a little bit of googling it appears this isn't the first time these guys have faked stunts in their videos.\n\nLast but not least I typed the title of the video with 'fake' at the end and lo and behold, I'm not the first person to spot this.

{"body": "4\n\nThe first thing Christo is aware of is the truck engine is still running. He is sprawled against the back of the cab, aching but alive. Ivan is tangled in the cargo net, trying to get free. \n\nChristo can see the cow in the field across the road. It has stopped to eat grass. In the cab, Riley is moaning. His arm is now definitely broken, he landed on it it when they hit the ditch. Clowes has a busted lip and a bloody nose from the impact. She has the truck door open and rolls out. Riley follows, trying to protect his arm.\n\nMartinez is not on the back of the truck. They find him in the field beyond the ditch, dazed and muddy and somehow completely uninjured. His helmet is gone and his wet hair sticks up at crazy angles. He points towards the communication tower. It’s less than a kilometre away. They gather what remains of their guns and equipment and start to climb the hill. In the distance behind them, the crazies are still coming, running along the road towards them, howling.\n\nUnprompted, Ivan settles against an old dry stone wall, raises his rifle and takes the closest pursuer down with a single shot to the chest.\n\n“All-right,” exclaims Clowes. She crouches down next to him and raises her M4. Her first shot catches a crazy in the throat. It staggers, spewing blood before collapsing. Ivan shoots another in the thigh, and then has to re-load. Clowes misses the next one. It has a feral loping gait, low to the ground. Her second shot catches it in the eye and it collapses, tumbling over dead in the grass. The last two make it to the foot of the slope near the truck, but instead of running up the hill, they change direction and begin to chase the cow. Soon a chain of crazies are running down the valley after the unfortunate animal.\n\n“Save your bullets, they’re not coming this way,” says Christo.\n\nOn they climb, the field gives way to trees. Big drops of rain spill from the leaves with fat plopping sounds around them. The tower is hard to see through the tangle of branches, but finally they emerge onto a track not far from the gates of a fenced compound.\n\n“Looks pretty secure,” says Martinez.\n\nThey skirt the fence, Christo and Ivan making a full circuit. Satisfied, Christo orders them in. There is the radio mast, a couple of service buildings and a small military office with bunks and a cell. There is evidence of use, tins are stacked in the office and there is ammunition and equipment around the bunks. In the medicine cabinet, Ivan finds a morphine auto injector with which they dose Riley. His arm is now swollen and the skin looks tight and angry. Christo orders him to lie down in one of the bunks. Within minutes he is asleep. Ivan speaks to Christo quietly in the corridor outside, telling him what he already knows. The arm is looking infected. There isn’t a lot they can do about it right now, so Christo goes to find Martinez and Clowes.\n\nMartinez is outside securing the gate with rope.\n\n“It won’t stop a person, but those crazies are pretty dumb. It should slow them down if they turn up here.”\n\nHe leads Christo over to the generator room for the antenna. Clowes is poking around inside.\n\n“Out of gas,” she says, “Other than that it looks okay. There are spare fuel drums out back, all we need to do is refuel and restart the generator then we should be able to transmit back to command.”\n\n“Good, get it started,” replies Christo. He leaves her to it and walks back to the main building.\n\nIt takes just under two hours in the end, but finally the generator grumbles into life and lights around the base begin to glow. They all jump at the sound of a Russian voice from the speaker on the wall, but it gradually becomes clear it is a repeated message. They listen quietly in the fading light as Ivan scribbles on a sheet of paper. The message stops abruptly when Clowes finds a tape machine tied into the broadcast system and shuts it off.\n\n“What does it say?” asks Martinez.\n\nIvan looks puzzled at his own writing, then reads aloud, “Pattern Seven is active, advise final protocol implementation begins, may God have mercy on us all.”\n\n“What the fuck happened here?” says Christo, then looks round at Clowes, “Can we get in touch with command?”\n\n“Sure, there’s an auxiliary radio room in the tower. Now I’ve disabled the message we should have no problems contacting the outside world.”\n\nThey all go to the tower and crowd in around the radio set as Clowes finds the correct frequency. Christo broadcasts for five minutes before they get a reply.\n\n“Christo? Shit, please stand by, sergeant,” says a voice.\n\nThe radio goes silent for another ten minutes before they get another response.\n\n“This is General Arthur Crowe, who is this?”\n\nChristo tells the voice his name, rank and serial number. He has no idea who General Arthur Crowe is. He asks if they can expect a rescue. The general takes his time to reply.\n\n“Sorry sergeant, no can do. All our birds went down over land. At first we thought they were shot down, but observers and radio suggests something else. We don’t know what happened to the other crews; you’re the only one we have had contact with.”\n\nChristo asks about a recovery by boat.\n\n“While you were out of contact we got new intel from the Russians. That won’t be possible, I’m sorry.”\n\nChristo asks about Pattern Seven. \n\n“That goes way beyond sergeants’ pay scale, son. Over my pay scale, understand? But I think it doesn’t really matter anymore.”\n\nThe radio goes silent for a few moments.\n\n“People thought up some nasty stuff back in the cold war, sergeant Christo. Things like Pattern Seven[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8&amp;list=LL1aJSEHdrD_de1a4bWFBBPQ&amp;index=1)\"\n\n\"Pattern Seven was a broadcast visual designed to provoke a psychopathic episode in anyone that observed it. The reaction was tested on Soviet prisoners during the early 1970s; the results were more than successful. An entire prison camp was bombed when the meme broke out and either killed or drove the entire population of inmates cannibalistic and insane[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug83fGYm-YI&amp;list=LL1aJSEHdrD_de1a4bWFBBPQ&amp;index=76)”\n\n“The files and all relevant research were destroyed. All evidence of Pattern Seven was excised, apart from a classified report held by the KGB and a few rumours at the CIA. That should have been the end of it, but in the 1980s pirate copies of western films started to find their way into the Russian black market. In December of 1984, a copy of Pattern Seven somehow found its way onto a VHS tape pertaining to be a copy of the Steven Spielberg film, ET. Thirty six people became psychopathic murderers during an illegal screening in the basement of a Moscow apartment block and tore themselves apart. The KGB sealed the building and used explosives to collapse the whole lot in on the basement, killing all the occupants in the process. The destruction of the building was blamed on corruption at the state construction company and 47 people were executed in the resultant cover up.”\n\n“You can see how that sort of thing could get old really fast, so the KGB set up a monitor program to try to prevent Pattern Seven spreading any further. For a while, it seemed to work.”\n\nThe general pauses before continuing.\n\n“Six months ago[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQgUVRzFNtI&amp;index=123&amp;list=LL1aJSEHdrD_de1a4bWFBBPQ) either by accident or design, Pattern Seven was broadcast on Chernarussia’s state television channel during a prime time showing of CSI Miami dubbed into Russian. The Pattern Seven broadcast warning was activated by Russian operatives in the Gorka Brigade 3 hours after the outbreak and repeated for 48 hours before the compound you are in ceased broadcast. We can only assume the base was overrun and the operatives presumably killed or eaten.”\n\n“The Russians could not allow Pattern Seven to spread, so all power and telecommunication links were severed. As far as they knew, it did not get out, nor could it ever be allowed out. If Chernarus wasn’t so close to Russia, the Russians wouldn’t have hesitated to drop a nuke on it. I’m sure they’re still considering it as an option, at any rate; it’s far too late now. There will be no rescue for you or your people from Chernarus.”\n\nAs the general speaks, in the background there is gunfire.\n\n“At five a.m. eastern standard time yesterday, someone in a location in Eastern Europe uploaded a copy of Pattern Seven to YouTube. The file was taken down an hour later, but it’s been replicating and re-uploaded over seventeen thousand times. So far we’ve lost New York and Washington. There are outbreaks reported all over the world.”\n\nThe gunfire behind general Crowe is getting louder. There are screams as well[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfmPREbTd8&amp;list=LL1aJSEHdrD_de1a4bWFBBPQ&amp;index=136)\n \n[“May God have mercy on all our souls.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423774970", "subreddit": "dayz", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I agree with most of his points but ultimately as an anonymous commenter on Reddit I'm going to have arbitrarily deconstruct his talk in a pedantic and tedious manner, often relying on sarcasm and a glaring, know-it-all manner to get my argument across. I'll ramble on and on about how this sort of talk diminishes the value of whatever it is he does, and perhaps tie-in some perceived moral slight against me personally. At one point I'll go off-topic and talk about kittens, and how my friend had two of them but one got sick a few weeks back and he would post this endless stream of updates every day until eventually it died and it was really depressing.\n\nEventually I'll start a new paragraph and get on topic, with renewed vigor and even *emphasising* a few words here and there, that require it only if you're reading it in the appropriately vexed tone. Oh, and I will of course use needless embelishments in my choice of language, like *vexed* and *embelishment* (misspelt of course, that should be a double l). This is all to aid the pretentious perception that he is completely wrong, and I am right. Amidst the inevitable ensuing controversy, I will adamantly defend everything I've said, even if the responses make logical and rational points to the contrary, because arguing on the internet is about pride, and standing your ground even if that means looking like a total moron.\n\nAt the end I might even cite a source I've referenced, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424354060", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 272, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The carnage that surrounded me was unspeakable. My comrades, my brothers and sisters I had trained with and suffered beside now lay about me. Some still convulsing from the after effects of the *Bangarang* bomb that struck just a mere three blocks away from us. The enemy fought dirty, but damned if they weren't effective. Dubstep warheads dropped in from low orbit, eurotrash airstrikes, and worse yet, Shock Troopers armed with Pop weaponry. Echoes of *Baby* and *Wrecking Ball* faded off into the distance, along with the screams of more allies falling prey to the aural onslaught.\n\nThe nerve of the UN to send us into battle with fucking Symphonic Rifles and earmuffs. The most powerful weapon we had against them was bloody *Tchaikovsky's Overture 1812* and that's just because we could sustain it long enough to make some ears bleed. But we were losing ground, losing men, and I was losing blood. Hot ooze trickled down my lips over my chin. My nose was starting to crust over as the blood dried around my nostrils, the smell of iron was nauseating.\n\nI slowly pulled myself to my feet, knees shaking and fingers barely gripping my Symphonic Rifle's worn out stock. I saw Harry and Olivia struggling to their feet as well. Harry's ears were well shot, red patches rimming the cups of his earmuffs. Olivia on the other hand had bloodshot eyes. She was probably looking straight at the blast when it hit. I popped out my cassette from my rifle, it's steaming casing clattered to the floor, reams spilling out the side. Fishing into my back pocket I pulled out a tape I'd picked up from home. Some Nickelback might even the odds here.\n\nHarry turned to me, goggles askew, \"You doing okay Riley?\"\n\n\"Holding together just barely.\" I coughed, it was hard enough getting air into my semi-crushed lungs.\n\nI saw Harry pop in a new cassette into his rifle, \"I got one last Bach, might be able to help us.\"  \n\nI felt a sheepish grin spread over my face as I flashed him my rifle with the Nickelback tape inside, \"For all it's worth, it might not matter in the next minute or so.\"\n\nSuddenly, our radio headset crackled to life, \"ALL UNITS BE ADVISED. BRITISH FORCES HAVE ARRIVED. SPECIAL ORDERS TO TAKE COVER IMMEDIATELY. WMD INBOUND.\"\n\nBig bombs never were my favourite. Always had the fear of what would happen if I was caught in the blast zone. Olivia started towards Harry and I, ducking down as we scrambled under a slab of concrete. A loud whoosh was heard overhead, a strike bomber most likely.\n\nWe never saw the blast, or the resulting carnage that followed. I woke up in a hospital later on. My head still throbbed from time to time with the slightest sharp sounds. But I'll never forget the low **\"thud\"** of the warhead's impact and the reverberating and ever resonating waves for the weapon's **[blast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)**.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424498652", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not sure man. \n\nAs a side note, don't you think letting the guests control the night's set list is a bad idea? Not only do peoples music suck, but it kills the bars vibe in a number of ways. For starters, the music doesn't seamlessly move into the next song. What if business is slow on a Thursday evening and you still want it to feel lively but not over the top? So you decide to play something like this: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOjYPbyiDU\n\n45 minutes crawls by and 4 or 5 couples and maybe a solo dude have bellied up to the bar by this point.  3 couples are having Manhattans, 1 couple is sobbing into their Auchentoshan Scotch neat because someones dead or maybe it's the relationship... and the solo dude is just casually sipping his beer playing with his phone. Everyone is feeling the vibe. The music is good. The room is warm. Anything can happen, and we all feel it. \n\n*In walks 4 other people...*\n\n...And you think to yourself *\"let's liven this up a bit more. I want everyone to feel cozy, warm, edgy, sexy, happy, flirty.\"* So you pop back to your ipod and you go faster paced. Something that makes these couples want to dance, and maybe chat with their neighbor.\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tNABViWews\n\n*yeah, that's it...*\n\nNow we're all buzzed real good. The music is loud, people are laughing and most importantly, they are spending money and don't want to leave for another bar. The bartender is cool and relaxed, plays good music, and makes a mean drink. I'm hanging here for the night. \n\nIt's late night at this point. By now, your happy guests have bought you shots of Fernet Branca. You're drinking, they're drinking. You're happy, they're happy. It's not crazy busy right now, but you've got your hands full. You're babysitting tonight - sure, but everyone is well behaved and the cougars are getting slutty. You, the awesome bartender, realize it's getting late in the night. You don't want to slow the momentum just yet, but you also are planning ahead for the next step. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlChqixpX6I\n\n \nOkay. Everyone is drunk now, including you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4wVkuJqCWo It's now 1 a.m. and the nice crowd you had for the night has thinned out. A few stay behind because they're in their happy places. You know you have to close soon, and your exhausted. They're not ready to go home yet, but they're also exhausted from the drinking and dancing. Everyone is on their 4th or 5th drink. Sales were decent, so you pop a bottle of Cava or Prosecco. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tmsJxgPMHQ&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PL4ADa-vP4XePSuK-6-BDfwJBx0E-OY-zX&amp;index=1 You start half-pours of bubbles and pass them around the room casually. People just smile at you, and shower you with affection because you offered them a great time tonight. One couple is a swinger and the wife offers to suck your dick in the bathroom as the husband watches...**with eyes only**. You *politefully* accept the offer (or at least I would). \n\nSo you made the night awesome because you controlled the playlist, *intelligently*. You also got a BJ in the bathroom too. You stayed on your game the whole night and obsessively maintained the playlist. You listened to the room, and played the energy in the room to your favor. Well done. \n\nNow think about what would happen if you let customers control the music. Those assholes will play random shit that only *they* like and also bitch about the selection, or lack thereof. The night would start like this:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye5BuYf8q4o\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7OgIMMRc4\n\n*And then fade to this...*\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DvRCykzHy4\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6c9Udooy4I\n\n*Then some-fucking-how transition to this...*\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvCgSqPZ4EM\n* https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=weird+al+yankovic+amish+paradise\n\n*Oh, and this le gem that no one thought of already...*\n\n*  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye5BuYf8q4o\n\n*Followed by some drunk idiot who plunked in $5 for his favorite song...*\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n\nIs this what you really want OP?!

{"body": "I studied handwriting analysis for 2 years in college, here is my interpretation:\n\n1) From the exaggerated loops on the letters such as M and N, we can clearly tell this is female handwriting (as opposed to the more masculine sharp versions of the letters).\n\n2) The handwriting isn't all that neat, and there is a visible mistake 7 lines down (the writer forgot to capitalize the first letter of the title). This indicates that sender is not very concerned with perfection, perhaps showing an internal feeling of adequacy, from some sort of high level of achievement.\n\n3) The use of underlining for emphasis is a characteristically British trait (while seen in other countries, most cultures have their own unique way of emphasizing words). This is not the strongest correlation, but it does help guide analysis.\n\n4) The lowercase f's are a dead giveaway for a pretty tight age range, around 20-25 years old. This is because, back in the 90's, many European countries decided to switch the difficult and unusual cursive 'f' out for the block letter variant when teaching script in schools. This change stood for a few years until the most recent graduates began entering the workforce, where employers complained about the new and unfamiliar 'f's, and the change was reverted. There's actually a pretty interesting story to that whole thing, if you want to read: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive_F](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) \n\nBut in summary, I'd say the person who wrote this is a woman, possibly famous, from Northern Europe, and in her early twenties. Hope this helps you find out who wrote the letter!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424991708", "subreddit": "Handwriting", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
