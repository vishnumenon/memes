This causes fruit to ripen quicker than they usually would. But Ethylene gas is also a highly ionic, which means if you put a multimeter inside some, you'll pick up a voltage. Okay got it? Now cats whiskers can pick up electrostatic forces in the air, so when the cat gets close to the banana it can 'feel' the Ethylene gas. Though this doesn't feel nice to the cat (kind of like a small electric shock) it's completely harmless.

But you just don't care and it's really just become a daily annoyance. \n\nEvery morning you get up, peek out the window and sure enough they are still there. You make breakfast and find part of the flashbang casing in your coffee. You get dressed and start heading out to your car. The frontdoor opening alerts the SWAT Teams and they continue to scream \"GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES HANDS IN THE AIR\" which is starting to get really annoying because you have a headache from hearing them outside at night as you try to sleep. You walk to your car trying to ignore them. You get into your car and roll the windows up, which muffles the sounds of them yelling \"GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES HANDS IN THE AIR\". \n\nYou start your car, and your favorite [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) comes on the radio. You smile and pull out of the driveway, running over flashbang casings and general debris from the SWAT team's shit. You arrive at work, and as you are working you look out your office window every now and then, to see a SWAT member staring back at you yelling \"HANDS UP GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES\" but you can't hear him, only you know exactly what he's trying to yell. \n\nWhen on break at work you go to the fridge and get your food, make a coffee and sit down to eat, but there's a flashbang in your food! The end of the work day arrives and you depart from work. You are almost home and are driving down your street and the SWAT starts to get up off the ground eagerly as they spot your return. You pull into your driveway and get out of your car. \"GET DOWN HANDS UP ON YOUR KNEES\", but it's just another daily annoyance and you walk through them like a celebrity being swarmed by paparazzi.

{"body": "\nWell it depends what you think \"wrong\" is. Nobody would argue that it is objectively a bad chord progression. Nobody would argue that it has no merit at all. People arguably consider it a cop-out. \n\n&gt;why not use it?\n\nWhy not try using something else? Can you explain why you are using that progression? Is it because you are inexperienced and just want to use something you know will \"work\"? In that case, why not use the 12 bar blues, or a I IV I V sequence, or I VII VI V in a minor key?\n\n Is it because you wrote the melody and realized that it is one of the few chord sequences that sounds \"right\" to you with the melody on top? Perhaps other sequences you tried are too out of place when coming after the verse, uncomfortable to play on guitar in the right key, perhaps this is the only chord sequence that can simultaneously harmonize the melody the way you want AND contrast with the tonality and \"feel\" of the verse in the way you want. \n\nAs an example that will make people groan, consider the song \"For the First Time in Forever\" from Frozen. Personally I think it's the better song from the soundtrack. The duet at the end of the song is fantastic and Kristen Bell had a great performance on that recording. They didn't use a I-V-VI-IV chord progression. They did use that progression in the far more popular \"Let It Go,\" and presumably, even if they wanted that progression, they thought it would be bad to have it in both songs. And I imagine a lot of people would think it would be bad to have it in both songs. And there's the issue many people have with it; it's overused. You can listen to three songs in a row that have that chord progression, and while none of those songs is objectively bad for using that progression, it does make you tired of hearing it. \n\nImagine if the songs [Comfortably Numb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7EpSirtf_E) and [Hotel California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyy4yaVwsv0) didn't end when they did. Both songs end with long, somewhat legendary guitar solos over the backing of the chord sequences played out during the verse. If those songs carried on for longer I believe it wouldn't be as good. Do I think Gilmour and Felder could have played some more amazing solo work for a little while? Yes. Do I think eventually they would run out of ideas for stuff to play in those solos? Yes. This is very much like what happens with this I V VI IV progression; it has been done so much that many of the best ideas have been explored. \n\nMost of the time when you use this progression, you are scraping the barrel for what interesting melodies are left. **It isn't using what is best, or even close to best. It is using what is good enough, what is satisfactory. It is settling for far, far less than perfection, and that is what many people do not like about it**. I could try rewriting *[Dies Irae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7eMctuJLQ)* so that the melody fit a I V VI IV progression, but I doubt it would make it better. Or perhaps *[Sound An Alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsCJMYgFNuU)* or *[London Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lotkzHsIuoA)* or *[Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)* but it wouldn't make any of them better. And you really have to question whether it makes your song better to include it. Maybe it does, and if so, then go ahead and use that in whatever way you'd like. But there are so many interesting ways to write music that it would be a shame to not explore them. I'm not expecting you to revolutionise music and drive the creation of a new genre or art form like Beethoven or the Sugarhill Gang or whatever. I think though, if you are making music for your own pleasure, you would enjoy it a lot more if you tried something more original, less common, etc. and made it work. \n\nAt the end of the day though, unless you are feeding your kids with music, it's entirely your thing. You're doing it for you, and if I V VI IV is what you want to do, then you should do that. Just consider that it's not what's best, that there are other ideas worth exploring, that music is about creating and discovering and most importantly, loving what you make. \n\nedit: i split the first paragraph after the quote into two and added a little bit about two different chord sequences", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426088660", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "These people's behaviors are patterned by what is called \"Epiciliopathic Structure Paths\". These were discovered by Reynold Arthur Hammond and his colleague Julian Branche in 18th century France, when debating if non-physical entities like waveforms had any gravitational pull. \n\nIn the early 19th century they began to theorize on physiological elements, measuring gravitational differences between people of various blood types. With no conclusive data, they were still granted funding in Swarthmore college to study gravitational differences of synesthetes versus non-synesthetes, and it was discovered that synesthetes had about .90 micronewtons per muscle fibre in the brain, or almost fifty times greater than normal! It was theorized that the additional electrical activity inside their brain caused the additional gravity force.\n\nEuropean Anthropologist William Donaldson and American Socio-Psychologist Dale Franklin both visited the subject when studying synesthetes among their respective folk groups, and discovered that high amounts of electrical activity in ones brain may actually impose a structured agency onto others, by \"camoflauging\" with the extra activity and can mislead others into seeing certain familiar forms, some of these forms being faces.\n\nIt is actually more common for this type of thing to happen in people with Epilepsy, and sometimes epileptics are often \"recognized\" right before a seizure. \n\nTheres a really neat documentary on it on Youtube, [check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426682037", "subreddit": "needadvice", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;The true turning point of the battle came with the arrival of King Elessar Telcontar at Pelargir (EDIT: please note that Pelargir is not Pelennor) leading the Dead Men of Dunharrow. Without this timely intervention, the Corsairs of Umbar would have arrived at Gondor to replenish the Orcish forces and completely destroy Gondor. Instead, Gondor received reinforcements from the South, turning the tide of battle completely and breaking the Orcish moral\n\nThis itself is a revisionist tale to spread the glory of the Telcontar House and emphasize its \"Elvish\" roots and access to sorcery. In actuality, Aragorn led the Southern fiefs (read: ordinary mortal men) to battle on Pelennor after defeating the Corsairs and the battle was a long drawn out affair. There are numerous eyewittness testimonies ranging from the ~~Halflings~~ Hobbits (edit: damn political correctness!) to Gondorian chronicles and Rohirrim epic songs that attest to the fact that Pelennor was a large, but conventional battle that lasted the better part of a day.    \n\n This misconception that an \"Army of the Dead\" played a role in Gondorian history stems from *one* single source, created some fifty years after the publication of the *Red Book* for popular consumption by a mass audience. While enjoyable, the authors of this saga took great dramatic liberties with the original sources for the sake of a coherent narrative that cold be understood by a plebeian audience that largely could not understand that battles are long drawn-out affairs.\n\nThere is a basis of truth for some of the Army of the Dead, but the existing tales are fragmentary and patchy and unlike the Pelennor, only come from one source, a dwarf who was prone to exaggeration in his tales (Galadriel just *gave* him three hairs! But that's another question) . Historians today are more skeptical of such fantasies since there are few corroborating witnesses. \n\n*Sources*\n\n[This Video pretty much sums everything more concisely up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427822024", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 39, "controversiality": 0}
