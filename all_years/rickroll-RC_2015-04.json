{"body": "The concept of aversion to interspecies miscegenation, or even mixed communities among proto-avians is unfortunately a contemporary reimagining of historical sources. The so-called documentaries that you may have seen in elementary school or even, sadly, on [National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH_b3_HVVbE) today are based on faulty, or even outright fabricated evidence that was collected during the tumultuous Bone Wars (*Master Naturalist : Life and Letters of Edward Drinker Cope, With a Bibliography of His Writings*, Osborne). This 'evidence' was fabricated during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by leading eugenicists of the time. The idea was to perpetuate the incompatibility of the difference racial groups, by creating the idea that segregation was natural and scientifically-sound.\n\nPerhaps this is better suited for /r/AskScience, but evidence such as [fossils of snakes eating a clutch of Titanosaurs](http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/132/cache/snake-eating-dinosaur-babies-fossil_13242_600x450.jpg) are often cited as examples of interspecies predation during the Cretaceous Period, when in-fact, it is actually a tragic example of both ethical norms of the time, a shocking display of violence from an otherwise peaceful era, and a flagrant violation of the interspecial treaty that had been in effect at the time.\n\nWe have evidence of the treaty in the fossil record, dating back to 250MYA. [The 'Rosetta Boulder' \\(named after its excavation site near present-day Boulder, Colorado\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), clearly states in the codified vernacular of the time, that \"no dinosaur species may cause bodily or psychological harm to another, on the penalty of imprisonment\". We have reason to believe that this treaty was later iterated in later revisions and updates, given its early appearance in the Triassic Period, although no newer examples have been found as of yet. The fear is that they may have been excavated and immediately destroyed due to prevailing thoughts at the time.\n\nThe *Land Before Time* series was created as a way to right our past sins towards prehistoric history. *Land Before Time* sidesteps the controversy and simply accepts the Rosetta Boulder as fact, and depicts stories of friendship and adventure set during the Golden Age of interspecial cooperation that existed during the Triassic and Cretaceous Periods.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427864316", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Today, I was happy with /r/askreddit's integrity at mostly ignoring April Fool's (Unlike last year, by god that was miserable), but you know what? Removing gilded comments is going too far. The gilded comments tend to be the best, I love reading them, for they are normally gilded for a good reason. Fuck you /u/AutoModerator, fuck mods of /r/AskReddit, because of you guys being Aussies, I had to suffer this a day earlier than normal. Fuck you bastards. You're asinine reprogramming of /u/AutoModerator was deplorable and awful. You guys deserve no more subscribers for this.\n\nI fucking hate April Fool's day on the internet, who actually loves it? It throws a gargantuan monkey wrench into my meticulously crafted morning and afternoon routine. I hate this, it's miserable, and when it ends I shall sacrifice 10,000 bulls to my Gods in order to curse you and your families with eternal suffering for what you have done today.\n\nAs we speak I am programming over 45 bots to downvote every single one of your goddamn comments, and then gild them for the entire duration of April Fool's, so you guys can see what it's like having your comments removed because they were exemplary examples of what fine redditors should be.\n\nEven now my fellow hackers (all of whom are avoiding the NSA) are going to copy-paste Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" into each of your comments. You want that? You guys wanna suffer what your users are suffering? Well guess what; it's April Fool's, I could just say that it's all a prank, so you won't be able to do shit about it.

{"body": "A fierce debate raged on - to press or not to press. Thousands had already caved to their desire. Thousands more held steadfast. Nobody knew what any of it meant. \n\n~\n\nMeanwhile, in a remote part of Russia, Sergei worked furiously in a dimly lit room. The phone rang, and Sergei picked it up, grunting an \"allo.\" After a moment he replied to the voice on the other end \"It is nearly ready\".\n\nSweat dripped down his brow, as he stared at the lines of code on his screen. There was only one shot at getting this right. The President would not tolerate failure. He thought of what would become of his wife and daughter if it didn't work. He had made some bold promises. But he was sure.\n\nWith a few more edits, he pushed the enter key, and watched as the program began showing little dots light up all over a world map. Within 30 minutes, he predicted, every website on the internet would be infected. \n\n~ \n\nIt was 4:00 pm at Reddit headquarters. In precisely one minute and 15 seconds, someone would push the button, causing every link on Reddit to change to [the same link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) \n\n~ \n\nIt was 2:00 am in Moscow. Putin hung up the phone, and rubbed his hands together. He had been assured that within the next two minutes chaos would begin. The plan was to crash the global economy by launching a virus that rendered login security to any website useless. Anyone could log in to any website and have access to all the data it held. Putin had a team ready to go within the GRU to mine certain websites in his quest to take over the world.\n\n~ \n\nAt 4:01:15, the button was pushed, sending Reddit's secret plan into action. At that precise moment however, the Russian virus hit. This created a chain reaction in which not just every link on Reddit changed -- but every link on the internet.\n\nThe GRU team had just begun typing in their assigned web URLs. Within seconds, as they each clicked a link, a chorus rang out from their speakers....\n\n\"Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down...\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427923723", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

It just gives me the chills. \n\nBecause there's just one microphone (and it was hooked to a fairly rudimentary tape recorder), the quality is awful. But the joy and recklessness of it is so good. It's actually John Lennon's drawl on 'How does it feeeeeel?' that inspired the chorus that ended up on the final version. The chorus Bob Dylan originally recorded on this take is very different, and would go on to become part of 'Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You'.

This is my first attempt at making a skin for rainmeter. FYI I did not make the clock. The original creator is documented in the code for that and [this is the original link from Deviantart](http://madmilov2.deviantart.com/art/La-Compagnie-des-Ombres-486976404). The only reason that I have the link above is because I changed some of the font sizes from the original file to better fit my display. If my link doesn't and you want to know what I changed, just let me know and I'll post the directions to what I changed.\n\nFinally, this from my 1920x1080 laptop screen so that is what everything is scaled for. And it should also be noted that the health bar is a meter that displays the current battery level, the mana bar is a meter that displays the current volume level (when clicked it toggles the mute function), and the arrow as well as the name of the application change according to the icon that you last hovered over with your mouse.\n\n[And this is just here for whoever wants it ;)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n\nEdit 1: 4/8/15 1:45 pm --- I have added some functionality to the mana volume bar. Now it displays they current setting that the volume is set at when the mouse is hovering over the bar, as well as if the user scrolls the middle mouse wheel while hovering the bar the volume will change accordingly!!!! As always, I am very open to suggestions and I will do what I can to improve the functionality!\n\n\nEdit 2: 4/9/15 12:00 pm -- I just added the imgur link for the icons that I used for the bottom row and for the circular menu. I hope that you find use in them one way or another. As always, please let me know if there is anything that you have questions on. I also re-did the links for the other downloads. This didn't change the files or pages themselves, it just makes the post look nicer!\n\n\nEdit 3: 4/9/15 11:30 pm -- I just added a link to the background without the lines. This should help those that the lines were bothering. This was all made possible due to the valiant efforts of /u/-California!

{"body": "Once I went to the House of Blues where they held a Karaoke night. A live band would plays tune while you sing like a bona fide rockstar. \n\nWhen I arrived, the band wasn't set up. My bud and I decided to leave, walk around, then come back. On the way out, there was this girl who dressed up like Fionna from the TV show Adventure Time. I'm a guy in their 20's but I watch cartoons all the time like a sick 2nd grader watches Maury because they don't have cable. Adventure Time is my jam. I told my friend that if we get back and she's there, I'm talking to her.\n\nI'd been exclusively seeing a girl for about 6 months. However, things weren't working out. We would argue about why I wasn't interested in going to the gym. Karaoke night was an opportunity for my friend I went out to forget about our shit.\n\nWe get back, signed up for songs. My friend chooses to [Rick Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) everyone while I choose [Santeria.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) I love Karaoke. I adore getting drunk on whiskey and beer then pouring my heart into a mic in front of fellow inebriates. We head to the bar and there she is. Fionna.\n\nI make good on my promise and we start up a conversation. We discuss what she's wearing, her awesome purple hair and what she's drinking. My friend and I buy a couple rounds. I learn She's a hairstylist from Iowa who lives a couple cities away. During the conversation, my watch band broke and she put it back together. \n\nShe's cool. If Marlon Brando and Lauren Bacall had a baby and that baby's godfather was James Dean, she would be that baby. Me on the other hand. Not so much.\n\nShe would laugh at my jokes, we'd agree on beers, sing along to the other drunkards but I punctuated everything with a high five. Don't get me wrong we were flirting. We touched, hands grazed, fingers intertwined. But every single time I remembered that I wasn't single. And every single time, out came another high five. She even said, \"Why do you keep high fiving me.\" It was a statement, not a question.\n\nShe sang Creep. I love Radiohead. She sang, \"You should drink more beer.\" I love beer.\n\nMy friend and I had work in the morning so we had to go. Fionna said she knew people in the band and that she came often. I thought I'd see her again so I wasn't too concerned about getting a number or an e-mail. I gave her a hug and that was it. \n\nI went the next week, then the next. She wasn't there. I broke up with the girl I'd been seeing. I went the next week and the next. I kept going to the Karaoke night. I haven't seen her since.\n\nI learned that a number is just a number. It's not a proposal. We wouldn't have gotten married. But maybe today, I'd be somewhere more colorful.\n\nTL;DR Met a girl at Karaoke, missed the opportunity to get her number. Went back week after week to see her again, but she was never there.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428605230", "subreddit": "AskMen", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, here we go... Some of these are going to be pretty obvious choices but I have a big weakness for catharsis.  \n\n* [**And You And I**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-rdL2KkvzY) by Yes\n\nProbably my favorite Yes song.  In my opinion this is the song that redefined the role of a keyboardist in prog.  Somehow Rick Wakeman has managed to generate a sound greater than any symphony with one hand on his mellotron and the other on his minimoog.\n\n* [**Awaken**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98-iBpbEbNk) by Yes\n\nThat fucking organ.  *That* ***Fucking Organ****.*\n\n* [**The Gates of Delirium / Soon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwhS0htex9Q)\n\nBoth the climax of the first part of the song (\"*The pen won't stay the demon's wings, the hour approaches pounding out the Devil's sermon!*\") before everything absolutely goes insande, and the quiet epilogue, \"Soon.\"  The whole song is based on War and Peace and so its kind of all about the horrors of war and Soon is the aftermath.  Being Jon Anderson lyrics the rest is kind of open to interpretation but I take it as kind of the last thoughts of a dying soldier.  *\"The sun will lead us, our reason to be here...\"* \n\n* [**As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs**](https://youtu.be/szJq1lwnkNw?t=20m42s) From **Supper's Ready** by Genesis.  \n\nHonestly the pinnacle of rock music in my opinion.  The soaring, swooping, and fluttering melodies at the very end always get me.\n\n* [**Drift**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZkaakNsL-A) by Astra\n\nThis song is absolute ecstasy during the last few minutes.\n\n* [**The Raven that Refused to Sing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8sLcvWG1M4) by Steven Wilson\n\nThis song's got to have some of the most chilling and at the same heartfelt lyrics/vocals I've ever heard.  The ending is haunting.\n\n* [**The Permanent Way**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gbwMI8RW6Y) by Big Big Train\n\nNothing can describe what I felt when I heard this song for the first time, and is one of my favorite instances of Leitmotif bringing back themes from all across English Electric Parts I and II.  *\"That is where you will find them...out there...working by the Hedgerows...\"*  And by extension, since this song is basically one big Leitmotif, the songs The Hedgerow, A Boy In Darkness, East Coast Racer, and even Uncle Jack always get me too.\n\n* [**Broken Arrow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW_ND105WfE) by Buffalo Springfield\n\nYou can argue with me all night and day about whether Expecting to Fly &amp; Broken Arrow are prog or not (they totally are, and some of the earliest examples of prog folk I might add), but regardless of what you may think of Neil Young, this song is incredibly moving.  The imagery of the lone Native American with his broken arrow evokes a message of \"they wanted peace but you slaughtered them anyways.\"\n\n* [**Echoes**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmADpBu_ZCA) by Pink Floyd\n\nThis song really takes you to hell and back.  The climax before the final stanza builds up so slowly that the release is absolutely incredible and sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it.\n\n* [**Sheep**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5mJQGMqJvw) by Pink Floyd\n\n*\"Have ya...heard the news?? The dogs are* ***dead*** *! You better stay home and do as you're told!* ***Get out of the road if you want to grow old!****\"*  ...followed by the sounds of hell raining down on Earth.\n\n* [**Dixie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwamxQMefNA) by Harmonium\n\nThis song gets me for a completely different reason than the others.  Doesn't matter how bad a day I'm having or whether its raining or snowing or storming.  When I listen to this song it's always a sunny spring day.\n\n* [**Scatterbrain**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xoC0rHd01w) by Jeff Beck\n\nAbsolutely beautiful song with some of the best guitar-work I've ever heard, not precisely in his expertise and ability to play a complex melody at incredible speed, but able to evoke the emotions in it that he does where the melody bubbles up with incredible ferocity before simmering back down and bubbling up again.  He is just all over the place here.  By extension I also absolutely love the song Air Blower because of the way it subtlety transitions into Scatterbrain.\n\n* [**Thick As A Brick (Part I)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUGBJA-eYEY) by Jethro Tull\n\nI love this song for more reasons than I can count on my fingers.  But the final \"*So come on you childhood heroes!*\" portion always gets me with that keyboard.\n\n* [**Hergest Ridge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4jeh5txfsA) by Mike Oldfield\n\nYes I linked the whole fucking album because the whole fucking album is beautiful and it's essentially one song anyways.  I can't really pick out any individual part that I like anymore than the rest, it's just all so good, and it accomplishes all of this without lyrics (for the most part) and yet is still able to paint all this beautiful imagery and almost a weird sense of nostalgia.\n\n* [**To Sail Beyond The Sunset**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oYRTAuw6tw) by Moon Safari\n\nThis is one hell of an album, nearly 2 hours long, and by the time it finally gets to this song I'm always so sad that it's over.  It's like you got to travel to this great place you've never been before but now it's time to go back to humdrum of real life and have to say goodbye to all the friends you made while you were there.  \n\n* [**Into The Mystic**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atV4fQ4Z68k) by Motorpsycho\n\nI like this song for a similar reason that I like the song above.  Again, it's an absolutely incredible album that takes you on a journey and Into the Mystic is the end of it.  Similar to the end of Supper's Ready, they have a bit towards the end of the song where they have all the band members contributing their own soaring and swooping melodies but before the song's over, being Motorpsycho, they have to go out with a bang and switch back to a Leitmotif of Through The Veil, which I can only take to represent going back out \"through the veil\" and back into the real world again.\n\n* [**The Doctrine of Eternal Ice (Part II)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSW2Nn0-kxo)\n\nThe second half of the song that begins around 4:40 where it slowly builds up like a gigantic storm to the \"*Bring, bring down, down the rain...*\" climax is absolutely incredible.\n\n* [**Fox On The Rocks**](https://youtu.be/N8Fx6uaCX4A?t=11m4s) from **Snowtorch (Part I)** by Phideaux\n\nYes, Phideaux gets two entries here.  They are really good when it comes to cathartic moments.  This is the segment that begins with *\"I know what you need\"* before bringing back a Leitmotif from Number 7's Interview with a Dormouse and then expanding that Leitmotif into the incredible climax *\"What if I said that the world doesn't end in the end but continues to mend itself\"*\n\n* [**Whaling Stories [Live]**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RJwDqjt-RI) by Procol Harum\n\nThe giant thundering climax of the first portion of the song is amazing and sends shivers down my spine.  Easily one of the best uses of a symphony in rock music that I've ever heard aside from maybe the Beatles' work.  Always listen to this one at maximum volume for full effect.\n\n* [**Autograph**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RG-r79QDaQ) by Syd Arthur\n\nI was not expecting a song like this when Sound Mirror came out but that middle segment where things just spiral way out of control is fucking awesome and totally envelopes me.\n\n* [**Bohemian Rhapsody**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) by Queen\n\nJust kidding", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429726600", "subreddit": "progrockmusic", "score": 32, "controversiality": 0}

You have: vlads, quelling, stout, smoke. You smoke and take rosh before 10 minutes. You time that motherfucker. You buy brown boots. You go push a lane or take ancients if there is no safe lane to push. You repeat until game is won. You never fight with your team ever. You never fight without your team ever. Wolves need no armour. Why do wolves need no armour you may ask? Wolves need no armour because wolves never fight; wolves split push. This is why wolves need no armour. Your team dying 4 mid? You do not fight with them. You do not teleport to them. You do not flame them. You are Lycan and you want to win. You have teleportation scrolls but you use them to get to lanes as far away from danger as possible and push. You tell your team to fight under tower. You tell your team not to come to your lane. You do this in a nice way because even though wolves need no armour wolves want to win games.

That’s right you sonofabitch: Lycan tells you that \"the wolf runs\". You pop that ultimate, you back off and you TP out. You push another lane or you farm jungle/farm ancients/smoke roshan. If you don't know what to do then what do you do? That's right; you listen to Lycan again and Lycan tells you that \"the wolf runs\" and that \"wolves need no armour\". This does not mean \"the wolf fights\"; it means that the wolf go split push. You are on a lane preferably furthest away from danger. You are in the jungle or at the ancients farming. You are at roshan getting that aegis timing that shit. You get necro 1, 2, 3. You upgrade your brown boots into boots of travel. You do it in this exact order. You keep that split push going. You smoke rosh whenever he's up. You keep telling your team not to be with you or come to your lanes. You are Lycan. You are nice about it. You are split push. You are objectives. You are win. You remember that \"wolves love to battle\" against structures because then wolves will need no armour and wolves can run in circles around the structures. You never fight.

{"body": "I was living in the area during the time the movie came out. DuPont Falls was Northeast of Asheville at the time of the movie release.

Some endangered species that lived near the falls really began to suffer. In 1995, the falls were moved to their current location.

{"body": "I thought Kvothe's sword was a single piece of paper? And he has a special copper pen with ever-flowing ink that is paired with the sword.\n\nThen all it takes is three poetic verses and your name written on the sword with the copper pen for Kvothe to have all manner of power over you.\n\nOver time, people started calling it Poet-killer. You know how folk are.\n\nThis particular weapon was the subject of many disagreements. For a time, people argued over which half of the weapon was more powerful. Eventually, a philosopher by the name of _Breann the Better_ coined the phrase _\"the pen is mightier than the sword\"_ and the matter was settled.\n\nRecently, evidence has been uncovered suggesting that both pieces of the weapon were useless without their other half. The person responsible for this revelation is Devan Lochees, the leading expert in Kvothology. Lochees, also known as Chronicler, has gone on record saying that _\"unless Kvothe learned how to fight with a pen from the Adem, then nothing Breann says has anything to do with the price of butter.\"_\n\nThat's a bold statement considering the evidence in question is still undergoing peer review. I suspect we will find out very soon whether or not Chronicler has hit another home run in the fascinating field of Kvothology.\n\n---\nArticles you may be interested in:  \n[Live in the Eld?

Now until you hit a thousand in either of the points (they're the same thing, just gained differently, more on that later) it'll reveal itself to be more than just a \"page not found\". Now the difference between the two points are that link points require you to submit posts/links to different subreddits. If people like it they'll give it an \"upvote\" so that others will see it to. Comment points are a lot easier, they are given at the end of each reddit business day (10 PM GMT) based on how many times you upvoted individual comments. Seriously, just keep upvoting comments. You'll hit that thousand points soon enough! One last thing, if you find comments or users to be helpful or just better than the others, you can convert your hard earned cash into Reddit Gold! Reddit gold gives that user the ability to access the top secret [reddit lounge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that only reveals itself with gold. Go ahead and try to go there, it'll probably redirect you somewhere else.

{"body": "Do I have a fucking story or what. My mum informed me a couple days beforehand that the family was holding an intervention for my cousin, Clancy. I wasn't exactly close with him, and you'll surmise why after I tell you about him. This guy was a walking weaboo, brony, /b/tard stereotype. You wouldn't think people like him exist but surely enough...anyway the intervention was about his laziness. He had dropped out of high school at 16, to watch anime, read manga and browse 4chan all day. He had told his parents he was going to study Japanese at TAFE (that's like community college in the US, but Australia...I think), and then move there to become a manga artist. I recall my aunt telling my mum that Clancy quit TAFE about two weeks in because he said that the \"guy-juns didn't know how to speak Japanese properly\", which I guess he had devised through his extensive knowledge of anime. \n\nJust for the sake of it, he insisted on wearing one of those spike collars wherever he went. But hell, Clancy even wore a godamn My Little Pony fedora. The only thing I found on the internet that resembles it is [this](http://i.imgur.com/qrOCyAl.jpg), but instead of the wings it had a blue \"tail\" at the back of the hate. Why have I bothered to paint such a rainbow coloured, ramen soaked picture of Clancy you ask? So you can picture the absolute mayhem breakdown I have ever witnessed as accurately as possible. \n\nI was a bit hesitant on going but mum pulled me and my sister along, on the grounds that it was family and we should be there for my aunt and uncle who undoubtedly needed the support in living with Clancy. So we're at my aunt/uncle's place, it's them, my family, my other uncle/aunt/cousins and the token priest, former school teacher. There were even a few of his friends there who I didn't know, but I guessed as much because  they were sporting naruto headbands. A bit of idle chat is going on but then we hear the noise of the front gate swinging open and Clancy walking up the steps. Every one by this point is dead silent, and have assumed positions around the lounge room. What I didn't know was that he was coming back from a mlp meet up, and was in a cosplay of one of the ponies (the yellow one?). So there I am with a cup of fanta and a handful of chips, and in comes Clancy in this yellow horse onesie. The second he walked into the lounge room:\n\nClancy: \"Mhmmmffmmffff\"\n\nMy Aunt: \"Honey we can't hear you with your horse mask on\"\n\nClancy: *Removing the head part of his costume* \"Baka! It's yellow hearts! And she is a pony! Why the fuck are all these bakas in my house.\"\n\nMy uncle: \"Well son, we thought it would be best if we all came together to try help-\"\n\nClancy: \"I don't need help from any gaijins. I told you I'm moving to Nippon anyway baka.\"\n\nHe moved across to the table where the food was and began piling on the different treats onto a paper plate. He also kept infrequently doing that anime thing where the character always moves their glasses up their nose. Thing was, he wasn't wear glasses, so he was just motioning with his fingers what he was doing.\n\nSo far, although things haven't gone great, not enough to warrant a total trainwreck right? Well...\n\nThe priest thought he would get in on the action. He walks over to Clancy at the table.\n\n\"Please Clancy, if you would just sit down with your family\"\n\nQuicker than a lightning bolt Clancy managed to shimmy out of his costume, and was in fight mode, holding a **fucking katana** at the priest. To this day, I have absolutely no idea how a) he got out of his clothes so fast and b) where in the hell he was stashing that sword. I can only guess he took it every where he went and had it holstered between his brief loops or something. But back to the story,\n\nClancy: \"Baka! Do you want me to kill you? Cos' then I have to seppuku myself!\"\n\nThe priest is half frozen in fear, half astounded at this young guy in his boxers waving around a sword. \n\nClancy: \"You want some gaijin devil? Come and get it! Kyaaaaa\"[that's the best sound I can recall, but pretty much any anime war cry would fit in well there]. \n\nClancy kind of weaves back in an attempt to lunge at the priest, but if it wasn't for the quick thinking of my dad, Clancy would have made sashimi of that priest. Now for the piece of resistance though, this was all caught on camera. I'm not sure if taking a video is common place at interventions, for use in the future as a reflection type of thing, but this whole ordeal was caught on film. I can't do this next bit justice so I'll [let the video take it from here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430312276", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 44, "controversiality": 0}
