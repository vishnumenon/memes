No Pre-Leasing!  No Rentals!  12-Year Contract through Sentara Halifax, with option to extend.  No cancellations, but you and Rowan will share full veto in soulmate choosing, when ERViability confirmed.

{"body": "Dude, do not google \"total hip arthroplasty\"!\n\nMy dad had both his hips replaced within the past two years. It's helped him amazingly! His back got sore from even the slightest about of walking and he had no flexibility.\n\nThe recovery seemed extremely painful for a while after each operation but that's to be expected.\n\nHe would thoroughly recommend the operation to anyone if they need it. Now he's able to play badminton again which he hadn't played in years!\n\nAfter seeing this thread, curiosity got the better of me and I couldn't help but look up the procedure to see exactly what he went through and I must say I wouldn't recommend watching it!

{"body": "Surprisingly enough, it's the first option you mentioned here. As a surprise for the astronauts, the mission control included graduation hats in the experiment package. Inside this box were two hats tailor made to fit the astronauts' space suits. [Here is an example of John Young wearing one of those hats](http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/LARGE/GPN-2000-001428.jpg). As you noticed, it isn't very similar to a graduation mortar, but it rather looks like a hood. This is because they didn't have enough space to pack the mortars properly so they just went with a simple hood. I guess it's better than nothing. If you're wondering why the hell did they bring these all the way to the moon? It's because they had to have solid boxes to bring samples back. While you're there, you might as well prank your astronauts with a little congratulation. \n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432882065", "subreddit": "space", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi, /u/Borntobethrwnaway4. I'm a male victim of sexual assault while in the forces and was at the presentations with Julia Lalonde and can give some insight. \n\n**On sexual assault in the forces**  \nMembers of the Canadian Forces are among the most mature and responsible people I've ever met and I'd like to make two points that prove that, if I may. Firstly, for the given demographics (employed, mostly male slightly less likely to be married), the CF actually has lower rates of sexual assault - based on data from the [2011 report from the Lastey Sexual Health Clinic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;t=0m43s). This, by itself doesn't mean that there's *not* a problem within the Canadian Forces, just that there are other workplaces that suffer greater. If our goal really was to be preventing sexual assault, we should be focussing on those workplaces instead of the Canadian Forces. These work places include construction, trades, academia, and (okay, this one is a little bit obvious but it's included in the report) sex workers. I'd like to reiterate that we, as a society, should be focussing more so on preventing the most sexual assaults and harassment by focussing our efforts in these areas instead of trying to save face in the CF.\n\nSecondly, that women is the forces are *not* more likely to be sexually harassed (and yes, I place the distinction between assault and harassed) than men - but they are more likely to perceive it as inappropriate and report it. I'll give an example. During an inspection in Borden (I used to be an NCM, seen plenty of bases), we were standing by our bunks (four to a room). The M/Cpl comes in, does the inspection as normal - assuring everything is swept and clean - before inspecting the uniforms that we were wearing. He gets to the last guy, who's had his balls out during the entire inspection. Yes, his testicles, intentionally outside of his pants. The M/Cpl looked at the rest of his uniform, his haircut, his freshly shaved face and said \"deducting a point for not shaving, private\" - referring to the pubic hair on his testicles.   \nWas this reported? No. It meets all the criteria for sexual harassment, and should have been reported. But we're all dudes with a sense of humour so we laughed about it. Can you imagine if the M/Cpl was a woman? The mindset of the practical joke would have changed because of the difference in gender and his testicles would have stayed in his pants.   \nI'm reiterating my second point - [Cpl Astley Turner has stated in a recent Metro article \"I can assure you that references to male genitalia are far, far more common\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;t=0m43s), . And it's true. It's not that the good men of the CF make lewd comments about womens' genitalia - we make lewd comments about everyone's genitalia. And it's hilarious. So, to emphasize my two points here - Members of the Forces are less likely to be victims, and *women* of the Forces are doubly less likely.\n\n**On Ms Lalonde's presentation**  \nMs Lalonde's presentation was a bust. Those who organized it only did so because it would look good to have a \"sexual assault prevention speaker\". They were stroking the feminists' egos by picking her as a speaker. Had they actually had the goal of having an open discussion and actually preventing assaults (instead of just appearing to do so brightly and clearly), the presentation would be different. The content would be different. The speaker would have been different. The time would be different. The slideshow would be different and the questions would have been different. I'll give an example: When Ms Lalonde was speaking on the topic of what's sexual assault and what's not while both parties are intoxicated, she was gender exclusive. \"If both the man and the woman are drunk, the woman cannot consent. If you have drunk sex, the man should be charged with sexual assault.\" Now, having been an actual victim of sexual assault while I was intoxicated (and I went through the whole court process and everything), this struck a nerve - Fortunately, it bothered most members of the audience who quickly realized that she was only interested in protecting women and had her own agenda, so they tuned out and stopped listening, she noticed and started getting flustered. She attributed this to us not caring about preventing sexual assault, but it was really just the mindful audience ignoring an ignorant and sexist presentation - Anyways, I raised my concerns to her about her gender-exclusivity and she seemed very flustered about the question while trying to regain control of the room. \"Guys, I just really....if you could just listen for one mi... I need about tree fiddy\". That was the exact moment that I realized that Ms Lalonde was actually 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era. \n\nThe point I'm really trying to make here is that if you want to prevent sexual assaults, you have to foster an open discussion. And to foster an open and serious discussion, you have to stop using things like throwaway accounts on reddit because otherwise, people just won't respect you and assume you're working within the media and just trying to get anonymous quotes for an article. Penis. \n\n**TL;DR: Statistics makes the CF a good workplace and Ms Lalonde's presentation was a facade.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432904321", "subreddit": "CanadianForces", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}
