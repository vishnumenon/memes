{"body": "The people you talk about attack Sunnis in Iranian Sunni schools, and [demolishes their schools too](http://ncr-iran.org/content/view/5572/1/). even though they are Muslims they attack them for being Sunni, that's not average. A [large number of suicide bombers wanted to go into Gaza](http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3651063,00.html) but the government asked them not to go. It's more like the majority of the people are more extremist than the government.\n\nThe picture is of a ritual all Shiites do once every year on the [day of Ashura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Ashura), around 75% of Iranian people are Shiite. They made a rocket called Ashura hehehe.\n\nThe number one reason why he's the Supreme Leader is that [the people almost worship him](http://www.leader.ir/media/album/news/9948_895.jpg).\n\nOne major reason why Iran claims that Bahrain belongs to it is that the majority of the people in Bahrain are Shiite. This means that if the majority in England for example is Shiite, Iran would say that England belongs to it.\n\nShiite people are great, most of my friends are Shiite, I live next door to Iran, I have nothing against them. I'm not attacking Iran or Shiites, all that I'm saying is that Iran is not \"average\" when it comes to religion, it's above average.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1234425010", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
