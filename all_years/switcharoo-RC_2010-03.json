{"body": "Are you sure you don't want to get a car? Even Hollywood is annoying without one. \n\nMy recommendations: \n\n* If you DO get a car, [here's](http://maps.google.com/maps/mm?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=34.12749,-118.324843&amp;spn=0,359.997589&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=34.127506,-118.324867&amp;panoid=yVW4XpM9WC15Tj3BvB_cAA&amp;cbp=12,11.54,,0,-0.91) the best place to get pictures of the Hollywood sign that's totally off the beaten tourist path. It's a bit too far to walk from the nearest bus station, though. \n* I can't believe you're missing (and no one has mentioned) the Griffith Observatory! This is like a requirement, and all the recent \"I'm visiting LA...\" tourists have missed it, as far as I can tell. DON'T MISS IT. You'll have an AMAZING view of the city, you'll get to see bona-fide Art Deco architecture of the highest order, you'll get like a foot away from a Foucault pendulum, and you can listen to Leonard Nimoy narrate a presentation about space. \n* I'm a big fan of [Greenblatt's Deli](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Greenblatt%27s+Deli&amp;sll=34.107259,-118.322039&amp;sspn=0.012863,0.01929&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Greenblatt%27s+Deli&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=34.102637,-118.347301&amp;spn=0.051455,0.077162&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A)\n* [Upright Citizen's Brigade](http://losangeles.ucbtheatre.com/schedule/) is a well-known improv group that has nightly shows that are very cheap. This is in Franklin Village, and Scientology's Celebrity Center is right across the street. I see (minor) celebrities in this area about once a week, incl. \"Wash\" and \"Capt. Mal\" from *Firefly* (in two separate instances), \"Dr. Karev\" from *Grey's Anatomy*, and Kevin Durand - the guy who killed \"Ben Linus'\" daughter on *Lost*, among others. \n* [101 Coffee Shop](http://www.the101coffeeshop.com/) has been in some movies and is a local hangout. \n* If you're in the Franklin Village/101 Coffee Shop area, the recognizable Capitol Records Building is just a block south and west. \n* Find an In-N-Out Burger - it's about 100x better than McDonald's, and is great for lunch.\n* If you're into that type of thing, [High Voltage Tattoo](http://highvoltagetattoo.com/) is where Kat Von D. works, from the reality show \"Inkd.\"\n* Again, if you're into that kind of thing, you can stop by the [Scientology Center campus](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Church+of+Scientology,+Hollywood&amp;sll=34.102407,-118.324982&amp;sspn=0.0156,0.027595&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Church+of+Scientology,&amp;hnear=Hollywood,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;ll=34.114221,-118.309364&amp;spn=0.058839,0.110378&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=E), which is, at the very least, good for gawking. \n* A bunch of celebrities are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetary, on Santa Monica Blvd. \n* Just south of the Hollywood Forever Cemetary is Paramount Studios, which I think does regular tapings of Dr. Phil, and does studio tours. Not sure if they're doing any when you're there, though, so check their website. \n* The [ArcLight Cinema](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=ArcLight+Cinemas,+Hollywood&amp;sll=34.107259,-118.322039&amp;sspn=0.0078,0.013797&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=ArcLight+Cinemas,+Hollywood&amp;hnear=&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A) has a domed theater that is well known for movie premiers, especially in the 60's. \n\nRE: \n\n* Madam Tussaud's: meh - have you been to the one in London? It's nothing better than that. Just a bunch of wax figures standing around. VERY touristy. \n* Wax Museum/Ripley's: same thing as MT's. VERY touristy. \n* Walk down Rodeo Dr: this is NOT close to Hollywood Blvd. Be prepared for quite a public trans trip to get there. \n\nEDIT: you can take the Red Line metro from Hollywood &amp; Highland to Hollywood &amp; Vine and walk up to Franklin Village for 101 Coffee Shop, Capital Records, Upright Citizen's Brigade, etc. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1269448052", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}
