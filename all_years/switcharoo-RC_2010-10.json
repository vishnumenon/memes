{"body": "I know of a family friend of my dad's whose brother has gone through what should be considered torture with his ex-wife. They had two kids and then divorced.\n\nLet me just put this up front. She is actually crazy. But the courts [in Canada] are so biased to side with the mother that the children have been scarred for years of their life because the courts treat her this way.\n\nShe's personally sent her husband and his brother to jail for three nights when she called the police and said that they threatened to kill her.\n\nThey didn't even speak to her.\n\nThe father for a long time could only see his kids if someone from her side or a social worker [who befriended her] was present. She intensely coached her younger kid [tried with the older one too] to say all sorts of lies in court. She has spent years trying to turn the younger one against the father and has had mixed success.\n\nI haven't heard the story of what she did in a while so I can't remember the details...but it is truly insane...she doesn't care at all for her kids emotional and mental well-being, she has lied and manipulated and gamed the system for years.\n\nIt's sickening when I heard his story and when I'm hearing your story OP. It's sickening and it's my main fear about becoming a father one day.
