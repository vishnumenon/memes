{"body": "&gt;Correct me if I am wrong\n\n:)\n\nHe was a box-to-box central midfielder in Brazil, which allowed him to both win the ball a lot and carry it forward. England's far more physical and the players are generally a lot faster, so it's harder to do both. Some players manage it (Gerrard, Ashley Cole, Essien, Vieira) while others do better focusing more on either defense or attack. With Lucas, what Rafa identified in him (and what Hodgson and the Brazil national team have also seen) is that his primary strength lies in reading play and identifying moves as they develop, making him (theoretically) excellent at breaking up play and winning and retaining the ball. That's the role Rafa put him in (although that was partially out of necessity - he had to fill Alonso's position and his passing range has never been good enough for him to play the same part) and it's the one he's developed into. Keep in mind that he's only 23, so at 21 he was in a new league, in a new country, playing a new(ish) role in a first-team he was also relatively new to. Now imagine that, but surrounded by players bigger and faster than you. Now add the fact that a lot of Liverpool fans (the same ones expecting the players to \"die for the shirt\") turned on him and gave him CONSTANT shit, whether he deserved it or not, often making him a scapegoat when many of his teammates were performing much worse. Now tell me how easy it is to adapt to all that?\n\nStill I think he developed a lot last year, and was definitely a pretty good player by the end of the season. This season, he's continued to mature and improve, but he's also bulked up. It's taken a while, but he's adjusted better to the pace of the league, he's working well with his teammates, and he's performing the role well [for Brazil too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZP4yeJXpsE).
