{"body": "&gt; A computer shop would charge me £50 just to take a look, this would also be a pointless money sink. I've always been able to diagnose issues accurately in the past, this is the first time ordering a new part hasn't solved the issue.\n\nWhat does that have to do with anything? You need to accurately diagnose the problem before you order the right part. If that $50 saves you ordering a new PSU and a new mobo that don't solve your problem then it was worth the money, right? It's cheaper than slowly building a new machine without finding out which part is the problem. Sometimes you just don't have the parts lying around.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you'd get as many issues (or less, for that matter), just that shit happens with electronics. You typically can't fix it in a console. [PS3's fail, too](http://www.squaretrade.com/htm/pdf/SquareTrade_Xbox360_PS3_Wii_Reliability_0809.pdf).\n\nI think it's worth having both options, if you like playing games. There are advantages to a gaming PC. I have a PS3 for the games that are good on a console, and a PC for games that are good on a PC. I haven't had to spend much to keep either running.\n\nIf you had an extra socket 775 CPU, would you even bother trying it out to see if you can save your system?
