{"body": "To talk about orc history one most talk first about their resilience as a people and why it has changed them forever. Orcs were a race of nomads who traveled the lands in hunter packs. They have the longest recorded history and one that includes their packs [their familial system] throughout. \r\n\r\nThe start of their struggle began when the orc packs accidentally ventured into land claimed by elves. They would venture in tracking animals and get slaughtered by the elves in hiding. Many packs banded together to combat the elves, not only over food but over their belief that the orcish hunting kept balance throughout the world. \r\n\r\nAfter many crushing defeats the orc tribes for the first time migrated together. During their migration a few pups [children] were taken by a dwarven scout by the name of Dunlap Goldhand. He carried the orc pups back to the great dwarven city of Harmalk [which means hearty village.] He lured the other orc tribes to come for their young and spread the message that dwarven lands were safe to all races without a home. \r\n\r\nThat was all a lie. An ambush was set and the orcs were then enslaved. This peaceful race was turned into warriors by their dwarven leaders whom believed that they were helping the world come close to the earth, through death. \r\n\r\nAfter many wars waged by the orcish slaves [and gnolls too] they had finally had too much of the senseless bloodshed and turned on their masters. The dwarves had prepared for such an occasion and had almost decimated the remaining orcish population, but at heavy losses to the slowly reproducing dwarves. The few orcs that escaped were soon absorbed into the few packs whom were not captured, or into human societies. \r\n\r\nThe great history of the orcs has all been lost but in a few great packs. One of great loss and pain the orcs are one of the only places to still not have a place in the land of Balgair.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1302064477", "subreddit": "planescampaign", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
