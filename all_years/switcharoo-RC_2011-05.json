{"body": "okay so now i'm thinking differently (and still havent heard back from /r/suggestalaptop mod btw) \n\n\nSo I went to best buy (i know...just looking) and I saw a toshiba that i'm sort of interested in. I just wanted to go and see some laptops in real life and then I figured I would look online again.\n\n\n\nI think I didn't do much with my old cheap laptop because it wasn't capable of doing much, but the one thing it did have was really good sound for a cheap laptop. \n\n\nSo I saw this [Toshiba Satellite](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Toshiba+-+Satellite+Laptop+/+Intel%26%23174%3B+Core%26%23153%3B+i7+Processor+/+16%22+Display+/+6GB+Memory+/+640GB+Hard+Drive+-+Slate/2292408.p?id=1218318237292&amp;skuId=2292408&amp;st=toshiba%20satellite%20i7&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1) and thought it looked interesting. They were actually sold out (and sold out at all the surrounding best buys) I listen to a ton of music, and i'm not a wow gamer or anything, so I thought I could do a lot more with this one.  I went home and looked at Newegg and Toshibas website and it was 100 less to order through them.  \n\n\n\nSo I figured I would order online today. I go online today, and not only is it not there (on toshibas site), but [Newegg is now sold out too](http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?nm_mc=AFC-TechBargains&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-TechBargains-_-NA-_-NA-_-NA&amp;Item=N82E16834114928) \n\n\nI'm especially interested in this for these reasons: backlit keyboard because I will be online typing at night/in the dark,  harman/kardon speakers, number pad, large screen\n\n\nI noticed some reviews from heavy gamers referenced that they weren't fond of the clarity of the graphics, but I\"m not a heavy gamer.\n\n\nSo I guess I wonder, once this goes back on sale or comes back in stock, is this an ok laptop? or what if just went [here](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/947319/Toshiba-Satellite-A665-S5183X-Laptop-Computer/#reviewTab) ...Or What if I bought the one i liked at bb for 680-ish refurbished through newegg?\n\nAt this point i'm trying to stay under 1,000.... with i7 too?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305039716", "subreddit": "Frugal", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
