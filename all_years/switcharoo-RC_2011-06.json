{"body": "There are quite a few things that people here have mentioned, but here are a few others:\n\n* Pizza: Chicago makes it like no one else. People tend to prefer the place they grew up with, so my bias is for [Giordanos](http://www.giordanos.com/) - it's big and consistently good, no matter which one you go to. [Gino](http://www.ginoseast.com/flash.html)'s and [Lou Malnatis](http://www.loumalnatis.com/) are amongst other \"famous\" makers.\n* Hotdogs: It wasn't until I was a little older that I was able to better appreciate a good Chicago Style Hot Dog. Just be warned that some hot dog places my ask you to leave if you ask for ketchup on a hot dog. Some places don't offer ketchup. I really can't explain it. There are quite a few places that offer a pretty good hot dog (you can typically get a combo meal of 2 dogs, an order of fries, and a drink for a few bucks). As someone mentioned, [Hot Doug's](http://www.hotdougs.com/) is popular, as is [Super Dawgs](http://www.superdawg.com/).\n* Burgers: to be honest, there are a lot of places that serve a really good burger, but only one comes to mind: [Kuma's Corner](http://www.kumascorner.com/). It's typically loud (hard rock/metal music), packed, but they tend to serve a good burger. I am sure some fellow redditors/Chicagoans can recommend some other great places to go.\n* We like food here and that is reflected in the variety of offerings. If there is a style or location of food, you can find it here (more so the north side of the city). We also like beer, and we have a few local brews that are pretty good: [Two Brothers](http://www.twobrosbrew.com/), [Metropolitan](http://www.metrobrewing.com/), [Half Acre](http://www.halfacrebeer.com/), [Three Floyds](http://www.3floyds.com/), and [Goose Island](http://www.gooseisland.com/), not to mention a few brewpubs.\n* There is an abundance of museums/attractions: [Museum of Science and Industry](http://www.msichicago.org/), [Art Institute](http://www.artic.edu/aic/), [Field Museum](http://fieldmuseum.org/), [Shedd Aquarium](http://www.sheddaquarium.org/), [Lincoln Park Zoo](http://www.lpzoo.org/), [Brookfield Zoo](http://www.czs.org/czs/Brookfield/Zoo-Home), [Musuem of Contemporary Art](http://www.mcachicago.org/) (by the [Hancock](http://www.hancockobservatory.com/en/)), and the skydeck of the Sears Tower (now called the [Willis Tower](http://www.the-skydeck.com/)). There is also a variety of professional and semi-professional sports. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention another of my inclinations: the [Chicago Architecture Foundation](http://caf.architecture.org/), which offers various tours, via various modes of transportation, showing off some of Chicago's amazing architecture.\n* Public transportation runs pretty well and can make life easier (driving downtown is not for the easily unnerved). If you are in the city there is the EL (train) and bus from the [CTA](http://www.transitchicago.com/) and [Pace](http://www.pacebus.com/) in the outlying areas (doesn't run as often). There is also [Metra](http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home.html), which is the commuter rail in and out of the city.\n* Check with the [Tourism bureau](http://www.choosechicago.com/), they should be able to tell you where/when some of the numerous summer festivals are going on. Look around, if I remember correctly there are \"visitor passes\" which get you discounts on admissions and transportation. There is a big comedy thing going on right now, the Taste of Chicago is coming soon, and many, many, many others (another good reason for public transportation)\n* You can catch a show: [Broadway in Chicago](http://www.broadwayinchicago.com/), [Zanies Comedy Club](http://www.chicago.zanies.com/), and [Second City](http://www.secondcity.com/) (a lot of famous comedians/comic actors have come out of there).

{"body": "\"Not long after the antibiotics were discovered and\naccepted into feeding programs for livestock and poultry,\nquestions were raised relative to their safety. Many of\nthose concerns continue today. The most pressing concern\nis whether the widespread usage of antibiotics in animal\nfeeds contributes to a reservoir of drug-resistant enteric\nbacteria that are capable of transferring their resistance to\npathogenic bacteria, thereby causing a potential public\nhealth hazard.\n\n[11,12]\nAlthough transfer of antibiotic-resistant plasmids (Rplasmids) occurs rapidly in vitro, the extent to which it occurs in the animal, and between animal bacteria and\nhuman bacteria, is not well documented. Animal bacteria\ndo not colonize very effectively in humans unless\nextremely large doses are consumed, and even then they\nare transient.\n\n[13]\nIn 1988, the National Academy of Science’s Institute\nof Medicine was asked by the FDA to conduct an\nindependent review of the human health consequences\nand make a quantitative risk assessment associated with\nthe use of penicillin and tetracyclines at subtherapeutic\nlevels in animal feeds. The committee was unable to find a\nsubstantive body of direct evidence that established the\nexistence of a definite health hazard in humans that could\nbe associated with the use of subtherapeutic concentrations of these antibiotics in animal feeds.\n\n[14]\nOther\ngroups of scientists have extensively reviewed the\npublished data and concluded that there is no evidence\nof human health being compromised by subtherapeutic\nantimicrobial usage in animals.\n\n[4,15]\nThe question of whether antimicrobial resistance\nconstitutes a significant threat to human health will likely\ncontinue to be debated in the scientific community as well\nas in the political arena. Antibiotics for growth promotion\nhave already been banned in several countries in Europe,\nand a ban on certain, if not all, antibiotics for growth\npromotion has been proposed for the United States.\"\n\n\n[TrololololooOOOO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcWfAwp_uSk&amp;NR=1)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1308469198", "subreddit": "environment", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
