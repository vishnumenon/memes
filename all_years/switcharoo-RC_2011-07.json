If it turns into a flop and only 50 people ever download it (say, a 100Mb package), they're out 5Gb of bandwidth and 100Mb of server space.  But if even half of them do something with it...even if it's inconsequential...it could ignite passions, lead to consequential things on the next game they mod, and spark the interest of the next round or even next generation of employees.
