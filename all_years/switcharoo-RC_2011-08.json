{"body": "&gt;Ok. I'm not sure what you, or other redditors, think when you read the word 'creationist', but I mean it to say that reality as we know it was caused by something outside of reality as we know it. Anything added on to this idea, such as the Christian God or the Muslim God, is not what I am referring to. I certainly can talk about them if we would like, perhaps in a separate discussion, but here I am simply referring to what we can discern through something fundamental to everything we know: logic.\n\nCreationist tends to have a slightly different meaning in this subreddit than what you propose but for the sake of the argument let's stick with your interpretation of god: something that exists outside our reality that caused our reality.\n\nYou are proposing we do this through logic. So let's do it that way. First off do you consider logic truths to be universal, irrelevant of the 'realm' they are applied to ?\n\nAs in does logic function outside our reality aka. in god's reality ? If it doesn't then by all means logic as a tool is useless in defining anything outside our reality including any other realities that might contain gods or other beings. If logic truths are valid outside our reality and in any reality then god in his own reality must abide but the same rules of cause and effect and thus also infinite regression.\n\nSo either you are proposing that god in his supernatural realm of existence does not abide by the rules of logic in which case he is just as likely a cause to the universe as the great big snot behind the black curtain of the sky or he does abide by logic and is thus vulnerable to the infinite regression problem.\n\n&gt;I, like all other human beings, have a certain amount of confirmation bias and predispositions.\n\nthis is the whole point of the issue I have here ... the OP is talking about science and the way it demonstrates a first cause isn't necessary and it is done using the scientific method which removes bias from the equation. What you keep saying all this time is \"god could have created the universe\" and when you are asked for proof your response (or cop out as I called it) is \"you can't detect him because he is outside the realm of logic and science\" (I'm paraphrasing here so don't take the quotes as actual quoting). \n\n&gt;Ok, and you might also say I have a conviction to believe the sun will rise tomorrow and I'll go blind if I stare at it. How is that relevant?\n\nNo ... you have a conviction based on the fact that you have seen the sun rise every morning and you know the earth revolves on it's axis because you have been taught things that scientist came up through analysis of proper scientific data. You have a reasonable logic assumption that you will go blind because you have been taught that lenses like the one in your eye focus the energy of the sun enough to make it damage your retina (or you have just accepted what your parents have told you about not looking into the sun).\n\n&gt; Obviously I, like you and everyone else, will believe what makes sense to us.\n\nWhat we believe does not alter reality. You can believe whatever you want but the scientific data remains the same regardless of what anyone believes. And the scientific data currently points to a spontaneous universe generated from a quantum fluctuation. No God Necessary. No Causality Necessary.\n\n\n&gt;How am I reworking anything? I'm discussing concepts such as cause-and-effect, so there is no 'data' to work with.\n\nCausality isn't something we are born with. We observe it as we grow and our brain adapts to interpret it. The brain does it based on data it receives from it's sensory inputs. Like touching hot stove = nasty burn. We apply causality because we live in a highly physical macroscopic universe where particles interact all the time. We don't see the Planck length sized quantum fluctuations that break causality all the time.\n\n&gt;Not necessarily. To say god is irrelevant is as speculative as saying he is relevant. To say God caused the universe, then stopped having anything to do with it is no less speculative than writing a book about him sending his son to die blah blah. Like I said, we can have a speculative discussion anytime about which religion is right, but here now I am sticking to what we all [hopefully] agree on: logic.\n\nSo to prove you are using logic in your argument you speculate that there is a being outside the scope of logic ? \n\n&gt;Why talk about anything?\n\nno the question is why talk about something that is beyond logic ? \n\nI'm requoting your original reply to me just to make sure I'm not leaving anything out \n\n&gt;I hope this is not viewed as 'hate and bile' but please understand that when a creationist (such as me), says that something unnatural/illogical/unscientific had to cause everything, and you respond with 'ok well what caused that thing?' it's kind of frustrating. Frustrating not in the sense that it provides a problem for our argument, but frustrating because it shows you have not understood the argument.\n\n&gt;You see, since the First Cause has already been defined as unnatural/illogical/unscientific, trying to apply those principles to it (such as cause-and-effect) is a facepalm. \n\nIn simple terms you state that god (which is unnatural/illogical/unscientific) caused everything and we are not supposed to use logic and ask what caused him because he is unnatural/illogical/unscientific ? ... I would love to go Matt Dillahunty on you here and ask \"HOW DO YOU KNOW?\" but lets just stick with your last line:\n\n&gt;Might it have a cause? Sure, but attempting to discern if that is the case, and what it may be, is quite literally out of our realm.\n\nso he can't be discerned? ... then why are we talking about him ... he is as discernible as a [Hooloovoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_races_and_species_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Hooloovoo)\n\nThe original proposal was the universe can't come from nothing because logic causality demand a cause to the universe but then out of the blue you just kill that same requirement by saying well 'god done it' but he is mysterious and can't be logically perceived ... by that same logic the universe as a whole (or on the quantum level we cannot experience directly) could be illogical, unnatural, unscientific and have caused it self ... you just can't go suspending logic where you think it will fit your argument.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314056815", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
