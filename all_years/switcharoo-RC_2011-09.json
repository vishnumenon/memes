ANCIENTS is a bit bland as an ancients system in terms of variability, until you realize that its simplicity is it's beauty.  NaW is a more traditional wargame, designed by SPI, one of the old guard publishers in the area.\n\nI happen to have written a set of advanced ANCIENTS rules that I'm hoping to test out tonight.  They're available from [my site](http://games.suspended-chord.info/), but as I've mentioned, I haven't tested them yet.  Also available there is a simple loss tracker for NaW.\n\nAnyways, these games will help you decide which time period you wish to invest your time and money in.  Both of these games used to be for sale, and both of them sold rather well, so they're not free because they're clunkers.  They're free because they're classics.\n\nThe C&amp;C system may feel a bit more modern, but I absolutely love both of these games and I feel that there is a lot to be gained from these older titles.\n\nEither way, I suggest wargaming in all different eras.  I'm mostly interested in ancients, medieval, napoleonics, and WWII, but I've gamed in WWI, the ACW, the pre-WWI era, modern (Operation Iraqi Freedom), near future, fantasy, and sci-fi eras, and I find a level of enjoyment in all of them, some of which overshadow my preferred time periods.  It's really a matter of the game's inherent design, more so than the pieces and the rules.\n\nJust my 2 cents.
