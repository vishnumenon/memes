That's when shit gets real, because nucleotides are *very* good at polymerization:  they create more nucleotides and throw off what we consider the building blocks of life as a byproduct.  Get these in the right order (and remember, these things throw off organic materials as a byproduct, so they *create more chances for it to work*) and you have prions.\n\nCombine these - a lipid forms a layer around some RNA.  [Now you have a virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis).  Any time the lipid layer closes around the end - now you have a cell!\n\nNow, most random sequences of RNA are complete derps, and produce random shit.  But if even some manage to produce desirable behaviors, like gaining energy from light (incredibly easy), you will eventually get at least one lipid layer around a RNA polymer that's creating molecules that photosynthsize.  The chemical reaction continues.  Nature just discovered the big trick to keeping meat fresh.\n\nThese cells don't resemble ours, because we've had the benefit of three and a half billion years of competition creating a crazy number of alternate designs.  Calling these self-replicating, sheathed polymers \"prokaryotes\" is almost overstating it.  But they're defined membranes defending a self-sustaining chemical reaction; that's life.  Add in some random chance in order to create polymer variations that are better at collecting resources, and you have varied suitability for their environments - i.e., evolution.

{"body": "Met my drummer through a local beloved guitar tech when my then-guitarist told him we needed one and he suggested his son. He was 14 and we were 19-20. [That band](http://www.myspace.com/borninmemory) died a slow death but my drummer and I still wanted to work together. He wanted to play death metal (we had been doing some sort of prog) and I knew a guitarist in a regionally big thrash band (their first album made a couple top-10 of '09 blog lists) whose main love was tech death. So we started a tech death band. Our drummer is 16 now, can blast at 220, and is working on his gravity blasts. I'm floored every time we play together. This was a little over a year ago, and we've got 2 songs finished, one almost there, one halfway done and four in the nascent stages. So I have a much better perspective on Necrophagist now. The sad thing is that most of the writing has occurred since our main guitarist has been unable to play thanks to tendonitis. He quit the thrash band to make this one work full-time and karma took a shit on him for it.\n\nThe same drummer brought me into an instrumental prog metal project with an amazing guitarist who just finished high school. They recorded [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/j60w3/singularity_the_new_world/) while I was in jail in May. We added this guitarist to the tech death project, and just brought in another guitarist who I've played in a couple other bands (see below) with in on the instrumental one.\n\nFinally, I've played bass with a kid since the end of my freshman year in high school, eight months into playing bass. My first band actually, and that lasted until halfway through our senior year. I went from knowing no one at the school to being pretty good friends with all of the members of the band by the end of the year, and they'd heard me play a couple times and invited me into the fold. We opened for some cool cats, like [Rishloo](http://www.rishloo.com/) and [Fair to Midland](http://www.ftmband.com/) when they came through town. We recorded [this](http://danielandthedragon.bandcamp.com/album/basilica-in-caelo) and our frontman abruptly got fed up with the band and quit. He asked me to join a [new project](http://danielandthedragon.bandcamp.com/album/there-is-nothing-left-for-us-to-conquer) a few months later, a fusion of the band we had and another he had fronted. This culminated a few months later in both my favorite live performance and the last time I've played live (this was ~3 years ago). I was coated with sweat and am pretty sure I haven't cleaned the dried sweat off my bass fully yet. He left for college in LA and we had mixed success keeping in touch and playing in bands together, attempting to put [this](http://danielandthedragon.bandcamp.com/album/inversions), which he wrote and recorded himself, into practice with the same lineup as the second project the next summer. That failed miserably. This last summer we had a great experience recording [this](http://danielandthedragon.bandcamp.com/album/disconnecter-first-edition), in which he's finally letting the fantastic musicians he brings together be themselves more often. I mean, I've always insisted on being my own bassist but there was a lot more group creativity at work here and a lot less frustration. We're hoping to put together a live performance or two when he gets back for winter break.\n\nAlso I've played bass for a couple of rappers which I met partying and in rehab, respectively. Neither of those two projects went anywhere.\n\n**tl;dr** Sixteen-year-old drumming prodigy, two projects, both full of awesome. Oh, and supporting my heterosexual life partner in playing bass for what amount to solo projects, though of late he appears to be letting go of his ego.\n\ntl;dr for the **tl;dr** I have way too much on my plate. And the above accounts for about a third of the musical projects in which I've been involved in the seven years I've played bass.\n\nTo the OP: keep your mind open and don't hesitate to jam with anyone. You won't know if your musical vibes agree until you play, whatever your particular genres of choice. Also, craigslist led to our tech-death project finding a damn awesome growler, and we're in a very low-population area. So that'd be a place to start if you don't know people that play.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319525927", "subreddit": "bandmembers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
