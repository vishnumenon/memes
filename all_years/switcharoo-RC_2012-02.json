{"body": "[The Substance of Civilization: Materials and Human History from the Stone Age to the Age of Silicon](http://www.amazon.com/Substance-Civilization-Materials-History-Silicon/dp/1611454018/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328063357&amp;sr=8-1) is a discussion of where all these materials that build our world come from, why we picked the ones we did and what makes all these materials tick. If you ever wondered what the world was built on, this is the book.\n\n[The Language of Life: How Cells Communicate in Health and Disease](http://www.amazon.com/Language-Life-Communicate-Health-Disease/dp/0309102014/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328063215&amp;sr=1-1) Is a fantastic book about how cells work and the importance of studying cell-cell communication.\n\n[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society](http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Psychological-Cost-Learning-Society/dp/0316040932) is a fascinating though somewhat flawed book on training soldiers to kill and the psychological elements involved.\n\n[The Meme Machine](http://www.amazon.com/Meme-Machine-Popular-Science/dp/019286212X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328063061&amp;sr=1-1) by Susan Blackmore has a very different perspective on the evolution of human intelligence and creativity. She makes her argument well, but the book does come across as dated.\n\n[Dinner with a Cannibal: The Complete History of Mankind's Oldest Taboo](http://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Cannibal-Complete-History-Mankinds/dp/1595800301/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328063260&amp;sr=1-1) Evaluates cannibalism's role in society and talks about a lot of surprising topics, like our attitude towards the young before the modern day, and funerary customs. It's a bit dry but really mind-expanding.\n\n[On Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805074562) is easily the best layman book you can read about how the brain 'really' works from a network level. I'm hesitant to recommend it however, as the author is a bit of big talker and likes to talk up what he did and many of his claims are wrong. But if you are excited about neuroscience and want a book to cultivate that excitement and present a really interesting **theory** of how the brain works, this is it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328063744", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "True, most people would agree that assault is rarely, if ever, justified.  But you need to consider both sides.  Being raised Christian, I understand why a deeply religious individual might have a violent outburst when a figure he considers 'sacred' is being mocked by an individual who does not share his devotion and respect for said figure (I.E. Muhammad).  The LOVE for a God/Religious figure is STRONG, which is why people get emotional when their beliefs are questioned or even attacked.   \n\nIt wasn't being offended that set this man off (to the point of violence).  This attack was a primal/emotional response to, more or less, an attack on this his faith.  This man was standing up for what he believed in; although, not in the most appropriate manner.  \n\nTL;DR [sort of] you can skip the above and instead ponder this metaphor.

With your fist clenched, you take aim and... depending on your level of self-control you either... ehhh fuck It, you knock that sucka out cold.  Everyone in the restaurant saw what happened, and you are met with **[Resounding applause/Handcuffs/Free PBR]**.  \n\nFirst let's think: wouldn't most people agree you were justified in giving Scumbag, Steve a roundhouse to the face?  So why all the hoopla when a religious man defends his faith?  Maybe because most people are unable to understand the situation from BOTH SIDES.

Just because an artist can draw something does not mean it would translate well into a tattoo and in the end you are dependent on the tattooist's skills with shading etc. Don't forget that an artist draws flat and a tattooist works with the location you want it on.\n\nI would try and get some imagery of what you want, get an idea of how it would combine and then find a tattooist who will help you create something from that. First step there is look for the tattooist. It's going to be there for a very long time so you have no rush to find someone and no rush for the design - better to look more now than regret later. You should be prepared to pay for their time in design - the studio I use will deduct that from the cost of the tattoo.\n\nWhere on the planet are you?

{"body": "&gt; I'm not asserting that oil will have more energy than oil, I'm asserting that oil has more net energy than ethanol that was grown using petroleum based fertilizer. Can you provide any evidence against that claim?\n\nWell, you see, I have this theory, it might sound outlandish at first, but bear with me. The theory is that unlike fungus and stuff like that, plants are not limited to extracting nutrients from the soil. If you look at the chemical formulae for [glucose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose), [cellulose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose), [ethanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol), you might notice that there's nothing except carbon, hydrogen and some oxygen (and in [petroleum too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum#Chemistry), by the way). So, if only there was some source of energy, plants could produce all this stuff literally from air (carbon dioxide, more precisely) and water.\n\nMy theory, and it might sound totally crackpot to you, is that there _is_ a large source of energy that plants use. Where? It's _extraterrestrial_. Yes, I'm saying that plants produce all carbohydrates that they produce using a large extraterrestial source of energy.\n\nWhy all? Well, if you look at [the list of nutrients that fertilizers typically provide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer), you might notice that carbon is conspiciously missing from there. So, on one hand, you can produce say ammonia-based fertilizer using whatever source of energy you want (i.e. there's nothing special about fossil petroleum, it's only used for that because it's convenient), on the other hand, none of that fertilizer goes into the resulting product, such as sugar or ethanol.\n\nSo it's not like you pour petroleum-derived glucose syrup on your field, then plants absorb part of it, and that's what you collect. No, what you collect is derived from a huge extraterrestrial source of energy. Fertilizers serve as catalysts for tapping into that source, they are necessary of course, but they do not contribute to the bulk of the output.\n\nAs a result it seems to me that the onus is on you to provide evidence in support of your claim, not on me to provide evidence against it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330343909", "subreddit": "bestof", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
