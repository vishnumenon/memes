{"body": "[Here's](http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd0410.htm) a picture of that engine you claim is dubious from one of the most reputable space sites on the whole electric internet. It was real. It went in a test stand. There was a serious engineering study about using four of them with eight launches of the also very real Energia rocket to go to mars.\n\nNow you're right to never trust what the Russians *say* they're going to do (unless it's \"launch more GLONASS for Putin\") but you really can't dispute what they've done.\n\nAs for the rest of you people on Reddit, remember that this is the same Russian space agency that is going to the moon in 2020 with a rocket that's not slated to launch till 2022. There's no money or political will for any of this and Russia's space program, though a point of national pride is losing a lot of its workforce to simply retiring them with no replacements.\n\nThis isn't to say good scientists and engineers aren't to be found in Russia, and there is still an \"R\" in \"BRICS\" so this isn't to say Russia has no future in space but please, be critical about things you read, especially from Russia.\n\nThis stated, I'm almost positive that this article is a sensationalist spin on a genuine engineering paper where the numbers really work out but in the magic world where there is enough money for everyone to do everything that is deemed feasible. It looks like it's about a nuclear-electric design (hence a megawatt reactor only giving a few kilowatts of electric power--that's a megawatt of *thermal* power). Believe it or not Russia's Stationary Plasma Thrusters were for many years some of the highest performing and reliable electric engines and so a big grid of those is basically off-the-shelf, hence the low projected pricetag. All that really needs development is the nuclear reactor and power conditioning. Of course it's never so simple in reality...\n\nFor comparison, NASA has a ton of these sorts of papers. Here's a few in no particular order. For effect I've chosen papers about sending people to jupiter.\n\n[I like this one](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120002875&amp;hterms=hope+mtf&amp;qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%2520%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26Ntt%3Dhope%2520mtf)\n\n[This one is cool too](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20050160960&amp;hterms=discovery-II&amp;qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%2520%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26Ntt%3Ddiscovery-II)\n\n[A bit more practical](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20030062121&amp;hterms=mtf+hope&amp;qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall|mode%2520matchall%26Ntk%3DAll|All%26N%3D0%26Ntt%3Dhope|mtf)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333515017", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
