{"body": "Dr. Krugman, first let me say that I used the [introductory microeconomic textbook](http://www.amazon.com/Microeconomics-Paul-Krugman/dp/0716752298) that you and your wife wrote. It was filled with excellent content that was very well organized. I learned quite a bit in that class and I feel I owe a thanks to you and your wife. \n\nWith that out of the way, I do have a pointed question for you. In August of 2002, you wrote an article titled [Dubya's Double Dip?](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/02/opinion/dubya-s-double-dip.html?scp=4&amp;sq=krugman%20mcculley%20bubble&amp;st=cse). In that article you stated:\n\n&gt; The basic point is that the recession of 2001 wasn't a typical postwar slump, brought on when an inflation-fighting Fed raises interest rates and easily ended by a snapback in housing and consumer spending when the Fed brings rates back down again. This was a prewar-style recession, a morning after brought on by irrational exuberance. To fight this recession the Fed needs more than a snapback; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment. And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble.\n\nMany of your detractors have used this as evidence that you advocated a housing bubble or at the very least, monetary policy that you knew would cause a housing bubble. In response to such criticism you wrote a short piece titled [And I was on the grassy knoll, too]( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/and-i-was-on-the-grassy-knoll-too/) in June of 2009. In this piece you stated: \n\n&gt; Guys, read it again. It wasn’t a piece of policy advocacy, it was just economic analysis. What I said was that the only way the Fed could get traction would be if it could inflate a housing bubble. And that’s just what happened.\n\nYour explanation leaves two possible scenarios with regards to your 2002 article and your subsequent policy recommendations. \n\nOne: You wanted the Fed to get traction.\n\n* This seems likely. In an earlier [August 2001 piece](http://www.pkarchive.org/column/81401.html) you stated that, “housing, which is highly sensitive to interest rates, could help lead a recovery”. You then advocated low-interest rates for several years. \n\n* This, according to your own explanation, means that you were either advocating a housing bubble or policies that you understood would cause a housing bubble. \n\nTwo: You did not want the Fed to get traction. \n\n* This seems unlikely as you are such a vocal supporter of monetary stimulus. For example, while commenting on the German economic situation in a [2001 interview]( http://www.pkarchive.org/global/welt.html) you said, “During phases of weak growth there are always those who say that lower interest rates will not help. They overlook the fact that low interest rates act through several channels. For instance, more housing is built, which expands the building sector. You must ask the opposite question: why in the world shouldn't you lower interest rates?” \n\nDo you think there is another possibility that I am excluding? If so, please explain it. If not, please state which one you agree with and why.  \n\nThank you very much for taking the time to do this AMA. \n\n*The fundamental premise regarding your 2009 piece is from Daniel Sanchez’s article, [Krugman's Intellectual Waterloo]( http://mises.org/daily/3530)*\n\nedit: Formatting \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335902725", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah, that CER price is a little bit steep.  I guess they're asking premium since it's sold out but you should also take it into an account that it also means it's an old stock that's few years old sitting in some closet.\n\nAlpha is a hit and miss like many cheapo chinese watches.  They look good but the quality overall is just way down at the bottom.  Fashion watch at most.  It's very much like a paper tiger meowing.\n\nI would go for the Maratac.  Are you thinking of getting 46mm or 39mm?  I think for your wrist size, 46mm will fill it very nicely.  Plus 46mm makes that watch worth much more than 39mm sized one.  I think they could have easily priced it for $300 and it'll still be sold.  But 39mm would be more comfortably worn I guess.\n\nI would instantly buy that Maratac had I not gotten my Seiko military. It's a well constructed piece for any activities.  The styling is based on rich history of Pilot military watches from back in WWII era.  Here's some of those [historical vintages](http://www.heirloom2.com/military.htm)\n\nThe dial style of Maratac is called A dial Pilot.  There's a German watch company called Laco and they are one of 5 original Pilot watch brands from WWII era along with A. Lange &amp; Söhne, IWC, Stowa, and Wempe.  Check out the [this page](http://www.heirloom2.com/military.htm) and go to the middle of the page where it says \"LACO WORLD WAR II BEOBACHTUNGS-   UHREN\" to read about the vintage Laco Pilot.  \n\nToday, most of the Laco uses Swiss auto but they have ones with same quality movement that goes into the Maratac too for &lt;$300.  If you would prefer a german watchmaker with history rather than having Sapphire crystal, consider [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Laco-Miyota-Automatic-Pilot-861690/dp/B005ECKPL8/ref=pd_sbs_watch_1) or [A dial](http://www.amazon.com/Laco-Miyota-Automatic-Pilot-861688/dp/B005ECKPEA/ref=pd_sbs_watch_1)\n\n[Sold here too](http://www.longislandwatch.com/Laco_German_Pilot_Watches_s/1826.htm)\n\nBut my vote is still for Maratac.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337806647", "subreddit": "Watches", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
