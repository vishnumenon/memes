Perhaps you are pretending something is good when it isn't, or even vice versa. You reject the tattoo (a permanent symbol of your personality, or part of your identity) meaning, perhaps, that you are rejecting a part of yourself (that you currently have, or are becoming, or nearing). You then steal and hide something from the same person who was trying to give you a this permanent symbol. Are you branding yourself in a way you don't want to? Is someone close to you doing this? Perhaps you're trying to hide this from yourself because you are afraid it will be harder to handle than to just ignore. Its always easier to ignore what is right or wrong (ignorance is bliss?) and steal what you want then hide it and pretend like you've always had it (\"it\" being the 'real deal' of whatever it is you want to steal).  \n  \nSo, if you don't mind me asking, what have you been rationalizing the most, recently?  \na habit?- \"I won't ever get cancer from cigarettes\"  \ncarreer/job?- \"meh, this job is fine\"  \nlove life?- \"i like the single life\" or \"my relationship with ______ is doing fine\"  \n  \nNotice how rationalizing is like rejecting something, and then stealing an idea (from thin air, basically, as the logic is never too sound) and then hiding it to ensure you avoid it?  \n  \n  \nHope this helps!\n  \nTL;DL- You're rationalizing something in your life, and your brain is making you try to find/fix it.  \n  \nEdit: grammer", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339105045", "subreddit": "LucidDreaming", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Penn State's student ticket sales have been...interesting. Before the ticket sale in 2007, they tried to move the distribution system to a lottery. [That idea died quickly](http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2007/5/2/154438/0849). For the actual 2007 sale, the entire allotment of tickets sold out [within an hour](http://blog.pennlive.com/pasports/2007/06/penn_state_student_tickets_sel.html). The TicketMaster website was overloaded, and a lot of people didn't get tickets. IIRC, this prompted the move to separate which day each class can purchase tickets, along with separate allotments per class. Despite an added [pre-sale registration](http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/052608aaa.html), the 2008 sale was the one that, if you didn't log into the TicketMaster website within minutes of the tickets going on sale, [you were out of luck](http://nittanywhiteout.com/2008/06/20/penn-state-student-section-officially-sold-out/). A lot of this was chalked up to scalpers. To combat this, [the tickets went paperless in 2009](http://www.ticketnews.com/news/Penn-State-football-goes-ticketless-to-thwart-student-scalpers509441). Eventually, [those sold out too](http://nittanywhiteout.com/2009/06/29/penn-state-student-section-officially-sold-out-2/), as well as [the 2010 allotment](http://nittanywhiteout.com/2010/06/21/penn-state-football-student-ticket-senior-allotment-sold-out/). 2011 [saw some changes](http://onwardstate.com/2011/04/27/2011-student-football-ticket-information-released/) in the student section.\n\nOther things to note:\nBefore 2007, [scalping was limited to license brokers, and only for 125% of face value](http://www.ticketnews.com/news/Pennsylvania-Governor-Signs-Law-Allowing-Ticket-Resale2716). However, you would often see listings such as \"Brand new pen for $200. Comes with free Penn State ticket\". That law was repelled in 2007.\nWhen paper tickets were used, if you wanted to bring in a non-student in with a student ticket, you could pay a $25 fee to validate a student ticket (or just use someone else's ID).\nWhen the tickets went paperless in 2009, you could only buy a guest ticket from the ticket center, and you had to physically go there (I think you had to get there before Friday, too). That eventually changed to include Friday.\nAs far as I know, the allotments go by how many people are in each class, compared to the rest of main campus. Therefor, there would be more freshman tickets than senior tickets. That may have changed.\n\nI think I got all of that correct.

{"body": "I like to separate hypnosis into two different categories, relaxation and suggestion.\n\nRelaxation consists of allowing yourself to fall into a state of trance. \n\nSuggestion consists of allowing yourself to submit to the authority of others. Suggestion is more interesting to me so I'll tell you a story and give you some amusing examples of it.\n\nWhen I was a child my grandmother and my godmother convinced my parents and I to go see a faith healer at a local church. My grandmother and my godmother were very sanctimonious and loved to be the center of attention so they collapsed to the floor when the priest placed his hands over their heads. Keep in mind that to the church not collapsing would have meant that they weren't in communion with the holly ghost! My mother and I are more private people (we didn't want to make a spectacle) and we don't really care that much about what other people think so the priest had no effect on us. It is easier for some people to lie to themselves when this results in immediate gain.\n\nHere are some wonderful examples of suggestion:\n\n1.

{"body": "&gt;&gt;How exactly do you prefer to use your office?\n\n&gt;Office holds two desks (mine and wife's), with computers, filing cabinet. The stuff that would go on these shelves would be a printer, books, some art equipment, pictures of kiddo, etc.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nSo I take it you'll need shelves that can hold up to 35-50 lbs?  \n\nI think slighting modifying the plans in the the [How to](http://www.hgtv.com/home-improvement/build-floating-shelves-to-wrap-around-a-corner-wall/index.html) I pasted a link to would be your best bet, then, if you're looking to go 'floating'.  \n\nYou can use [oak plywood](http://www.google.com/search?q=oak+plywood&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xOjdT_CNLKLH6AHa6NibCw&amp;ved=0CNMBEK0E) in place of the birch plywood, and then stain it with a dark stain that matches the kitchen.\n\n\n***\n\n&gt;&gt;Or maybe you want to get industrial and [mix steel and mahogany](http://imgur.com/u0FY9).\n\n&gt;I like those. Will show the wife.\n\n\n***\n\n\nCool.  I am glad you like them, I thought they were pretty incredible when I first spotted them.**\n\n\n***\n\n\nAbout your living room:\n\nI hear your concern about it looking 'cheap' or 'pre-fab'... but maybe something like [that link](http://imgur.com/sZpjj) I shared before that was 'overkill' for the office will work well in the living room (sounds more like a sitting room)?\n\nBuild the bookshelf in the near-center of that large open wall.  I'd make it floor-to-ceiling.\n\n\n**[Here's a drawing of  what I was thinking. I'm not a professional. It's in paint...humor me!](http://imgur.com/JlTuX)**\n\n\nBox out a large space in the middle, like a space left for a wide panel flatscreen TV, but instead of a flat screen, showcase a large piece of art.  Illuminate it with your recessed lighting or get an art light for the inside of the bookcase.\n\nCreate similar but smaller 'boxes' in other areas of the book case, and you've got a nice focal point for that cavernous space. All your books stacked ceiling high, with sections broken up by artwork will look amazing.  The fireplace being a second focal point will help fill the room with a bit of warmth, but not so much that you lose the open grandeur of the space.\n\nFlank the fire place and book shelves with armchairs and a nice console table.  A few tall side tables and plants can hide odd corners.  Hang a frame to the right of the fireplace.  Put a long, low table towards where the dining table must have been, with two chairs facing the sitting area/fireplace.  Corner rails on the corner from the great room to this living room/sitting room will reduce wear &amp; tear and help divide the rooms from each other.  \n\nA [low upholstered bench](http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/home-furniture-accent/22937866.jsp) in front of the fire welcomes cuddling flameside on chilly nights.\n\n\nThese are pictures of what types of designs influenced what I'm trying to describe:\n\nThese built-in benches aren't your style, but I'm just paying attention to the structure here.  I think  reading bench from under the middle part of the shelves all the way to the left where they stop would be a really nice touch.   [brown wood, traditional style,](http://www.furniture-sculpture.com/gallery/pic40.jpg)\n\nSomething like this [white window bench](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-6ynvi5NjULM/TeaGMT6_SoI/AAAAAAAAGSk/ajWazK536vY/built-in-bookcase-and-bench-window-s%25255B2%25255D%25255B2%25255D.png)\n\n ...or these [wall of shelves of art &amp; other items- could hold books, too](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-07qle7I2Wn8/ToW9LoJ9sEI/AAAAAAAAQfg/RM06cs4w97c/s1600/wall+of+shelves+wall+of+art+inez-van-lamsweerde-vinoodh-matadin-05-dining-area.jpg)\n\n...or this [custom-made wall of shelves](http://imgur.com/81wEI)\n\nTo include what I think is a bad one, here's a [custom art-media- &amp; book- shelf](http://imgur.com/Htxme) that went for it, but IMHO ends up missing the mark.  The room looks so squat, and I think that's because of all the top-heavy shelving.  I would have put more shelves at the bottom to even things out with the art.  But they did use some really cleaver floating shelving you might like.\n\n***\n\n&gt;Hence, turning to \"experts\" for ideas.\n\n***\n\n**I want to make it really clear that I'm NOT a professional at all.  I do enjoy this. So if something I suggest sparks an idea for you and it was free advice, hey great!  There are also plenty of professional designers on the site, but they don't usually touch posts without exact floor plans, measurements, budget, etc.**\n\nAnyway happy decorating guys!!!

It's just a tracing.\n\nWhen he isn't murdering people or having sex with [Goga Sekulic](http://tekstovi-pesama.com/g_img2/1/g/4356/goga%2520sekulic-2.jpg) (NSFW), he's averaging 18/10 per 36 minutes on 56% shooting. After averaging 7.3 fouls and 3.7 turnovers per 36 last year, he cut those numbers down to 2.8 and 2.5 in 2011-2012. He is the best offensive rebounder in basketball. He shoots 90-95% of his shots within 6 feet of the basket, 70% at the rim. He is a beast of a man, a machine of blood and iron, and plays C.\n\nSo yeah, I'd switch that C with SF.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340300720", "subreddit": "nba", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}
