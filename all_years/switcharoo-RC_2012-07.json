{"body": "&gt;say that your sources aren't exactly unbiased.\n\nBias in this matter is irrelevant.  I chose those articles because they refer to the irrefutable facts.  For example, Krguman got Moore's law wrong - period - he did - I chose that article because if I posted [Krugman's article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/opinion/krugman-here-comes-solar-energy.html?_r=2&amp;hp) you wouldn't have understood that there was a controversy over his idiocy.  \n\n&gt;Would you like to see how he argues from then on\nNo, because it is not relevant to my point.  I personally have watched the whole thing, but I posted that clip, again, for a point.  \n\nI'm going to stop here - you're just going to try to keep using this same sophistry of trying to undercut my points by collaterally attacking them. I'll read the rest of your post - but if you keep doing the same sophistry over and over again - then I'm done.  This isn't an argument, you're just intentionally being obtuse to defend Krugman when in reality you're bringing up collateral points.  \n\nInstead of talking about whether Krugman was wrong about Moore's law, you undercut the credibility of the article I posted - this is collateral and cowardly [and just a sample of your fallacies].  \n\nLets see if anything in the rest of your post has any substance:\n\n...\n\n&gt;Please point out to me where Krugman is wrong on this one\n\nhe is wrong to challenge the only god damned country in the eurozone who is actually adhering to principles of the eurozone agreement.  Almost every other country is just riding the coat tails of the countries who have been living on austerity - those socialist-keynesian succubi (greece, italy, spain, ireland) are destroying well-run countries.  Estonia decided to be fiscally responsible and Krugman attacked them.  \n\nYou should read more about this, the history of it is well beyond what you're proposing - this is not an isolated incident and your patent ignorance of the topic is demonstrative of your intellectual rigor on the subject. [I can collaterally attack too].  \n\n&gt;of Krugman and the credit bubble\n\nHe has said these things repeatedly... He directly calls for the use of inflation to cure the economy... He is insane for these things that he says - and defends - constantly.  \n\n&gt;Krugman doesn't misuse Moore's Law\n\nYes, he does, and I take it from what you said, you are not an expert in computer technology and history - I am.  You, just like Krugman, do not understand Moore's law and he misused it - and you are defending him because you don't understand it either.  \n\nYou are now the third person to defend Krugman's use of Moore's law... I have had 2 other people defend his use of Moore's law and none of you know anything about computer tech... it seems like a symptom of a disease.  \n\nIf I don't know anything about something, I won't talk about it.  If you present me with a question on neural science - I will refrain from answering.  If you quote Thomas Sowell misusing some principle of neural science, I will say, \"I cannot defend him on that point because I do not know enough about neural science to evaluate his response.\"  \n\nInstead those of you who support Krugman, support him blindly... He misused Moore's law - period - you defending his misuse of Moore's law demonstrates your inability to objectively read anything Krugman says.  \n\n&gt;On Diocletian and the fall of Rome\n\nHuman nature has not changed in 2,000 years - the same failing policies back then will fail today and have failed in dozens of other countries through abandonment or the outright destruction of the country or economy.

But it was the US beta, and I'm in EU.\n\nThe solution is kinda simple.  Make yourself a US PSN account - all you need is a new e-mail address and an 'actual' address in the USA. You can make it anywhere, use google earth/maps to looks somewhere up if you want, or just make it something really simple like Beverly Hills 90210 or Nintendo US headquarters (150th Avenue, Northeast Redmond, WA 98052).  You can make up the rest of the personal information.\n\nThen, go on that account, go the US PSN store and put your code in.  Download the beta.  Then simply switch users back to your main account, and the beta will be there for you to access.  You have to keep the 'US' account on your machine otherwise the beta will get deleted, but as long as you keep it on you can play it on any account.\n\nObviously, this has other advantages too.  You can play and download any demos that are on the US PSN, and you can download games they have over there that we don't have too.  BUT you're going to need a US-addressed debit card (kinda difficult to set up) OR a US PSN card (easier to access, people sell them on ebay &amp; certain websites all the time where they e-mail you the code).\n\nAnyway, hope some of this helps if you decide to do it :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342699328", "subreddit": "PS3", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
