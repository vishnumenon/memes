If in 3 months you are still sure you want THAT SAME tattoo in THAT SAME SPOT, then you go get it. If you have changed the design, color, or location of your tattoo plan... then stop, make a decision, and give yourself a new waiting period. If you are still indecisive, you REALLY want to question whether you are ready.\n\n2. I went up to [Old School Tattoo](http://www.old-school-tattoo.com/index.htm) in Bellingham for my tattoo, and have been really happy with not only the consultation, but the tattoo itself is beautiful and is holding up really well. \n\n3. That being said... you need to look at a lot of portfolios to find someone for you. Make sure they are pictures of the tattoos after they have healed up a little bit. Drawing on paper is one thing, drawing on a person is another. When the tattoo is \"fresh\" it can look a little different than it does a year or two down the line. \n\n4. Someone recommended drawing the tattoo on with a sharpie and walking around for a week to make sure location is good. I STRONGLY recommend this. Try wearing different clothes over it to make sure you like how it plays with your clothes. I have a friend who got a BEAUTIFUL tattoo on her shoulder... but it looks weird with a bra strap covering the part it does. An inch to the side... the strap wouldn't be cutting though the eye of the face.\n\n5. If your mom is that upset about the tattoo, talk to her about why, and talk to her about why you want one. Let her know BEFOREHAND that you are not doing this to rebel, and that you do love her and respect her, but this is a decision you are making, and is not a reflection of her. See if you can convince her to come with you for support. My parents were NOT super keen on me getting mine, but I talked to my mom a lot about what it meant to me, and I showed her the image I was getting, and where i was getting it, and how i was giving myself a 3-month waiting period to be really sure, and she said afterwards that she really respected my decision after that, and even considers getting a tattoo herself someday - when she is already wrinkly and saggy. It turned a point of contention into a real bonding thing for us.\n\n[edit] Numbering was messed up... weird.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344613403", "subreddit": "Seattle", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
