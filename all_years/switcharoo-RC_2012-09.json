{"body": "Islam is not a unique religion. It is helpful to think of religion as a political campaign. If you knew a bit of American politics, it would be more helpful.\n\nA political party will have its core values. However to successfully propagate, it must adapt a certain amount to the locals, their beliefs, their traditions, their cultures. Getting someone to completely reject their way of life is more different, it is more about spin and malleability.  \"You guys have it right, pretty much, you just need to alter this\". You can see this in Indonesia where Muslims also believe in local Bomoh or magic men. You can see this in South America where Christianity is infused with local traditions. Look into Orthodox Christianity. Religion and culture were fused from the start, but unless you have unlimited petrodollars/influence, you may have to adapt certain amounts to the local populace, at least in the beginning. Once you have secured your demographic, you can begin to bring about change back to your original style or any other that you wish.\n\nThose in charge of Religious groups are a lot smarter than most give credit for. They understand evolution, \"adapt or die\". Which is why you see the neutered versions of Christianity, Gay Priests, female priests, acceptance of the theory of Evolution [Islam too].\n\nIf i had not been raised better, I would have gone into politics or religion.

{"body": "Aha.  Yeah this is a really great idea that needs to go forward, and is tied to a lot of other ideas and people in the Reddit music sphere.  I've been trying to write something inspiring to introduce it, but life gets in the way and it's not a secret.\n\n&gt; that probably all of us want to do.\n\nThis is so true, and really important.  There's *a lot more than 100* serious, dedicated, professional musicians on Reddit who routinely join up in these projects/contests/subs.  Many have expressed interest in charity, publicity, integration... my sense is that folks *really are* willing to think about how Reddit at large can work inside and around the old industry to promote the material we generate.  Time is ripe!\n\n&gt; the charity aspect\n\nSkipping just the idea of doing good things for good causes (which I'm all for), we can look right at \"the money\" and the projects explain themselves.\n\nShort version: when you write something and publish it, you \"own the rights\" to it, and the whole industry is about *licensing* those rights in exchange for their help in selling it.  You own 100% of the cash you make off your home-burned CD, some percentage less if iTunes sells it for you.\n\nIn our [round winning tour de force](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofbands/comments/xxmpp/epoch_2_round_1_winners_and_round_recap/) entry [What Is Love?](http://soundcloud.com/memefilter/what-is-love) I own 33% of the IP for the recorded work, for example.  Won't buy me a cup of coffee ATM, but I still like it and want folks to hear it.  :D\n\nI can donate the sales of a *specific* promotion to a charity, or [license HQ versions for special release in reward for a donation to a second/third party](http://www.reddit.com/r/radioreddit/comments/zy2yn/announcement_the_first_best_of_radio_reddit/), or sell them to Sony or Disney.  All of it is super simple music law 101, none of it requires anything more than reading basic English, and it's all rock solid IP law.\n\n&gt; we attempt to front page\n\nAFAIK, Reddit Inc. has been willing to \"sponsored link\" (or w/e it's called) cool subreddit promotions.  I imagine if we have our proverbial shit together we can find a way to get an email to staff, with a good likelihood of positive response.\n\n&gt; We include a booklet\n\nAs much \"added value\" as possible.  My emails from the writing phases are fair game, in my book.  License that shit too lol - I love behind the scenes stuff.  Anyway...\n\nCharity works well for GOB, but there's no reason [EDM](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/) can't negotiate directly w/ DJ's, or Songwars w/ Bandcamp and Paypal.  There's really no limit to how you can put together the puzzle pieces so everyone can get their cut of a potential pie, transparently and reliably.\n\nAnd there's an audience!  A conversation unto itself if you want a rigorous proof, but IMO a song could explode out of Reddit any second now.  Reddit's a fucking *huge* userbase and the songs are definitely that good.  They just don't know we're here.  Someone is going to be in the right place at the right time, let's be ready.\n\n**So**, I propose GOB introduce some language to the sidebar like: \"by submitting an entry you accept ownership of your portion of the submitted work.\"... which makes the rest possible.  Then, I and my co-writers can easily sign off [an email is arguably fine] the revenues from a *single* website for a *limited period* to *any* third parties.  Or percentages of multiple revenues, or any other music industry contract point - the details don't change the fundamental structure.\n\nThen GOB can set up a bandcamp or paypal, register as a 501 (for example and or not), partner w/ various charities etc... and it's all smooth as silk because everyone knows what they're getting into in advance and there's a clear paper trail.  Or maybe EDM registers as an LLC and becomes a for profit label, or /r/songwars contributors agree to license everything Creative Commons.  Details don't matter - they're all valid, and the artist(s) own everything unless and until they sign some away.\n\nA lot of people have talked about a Reddit \"record label\", but this seems to me the end run around a metric shitton of stupid debate: insert text in the sidebar that *serves notice of intent to retain all rights to the respective artists* (IANAL).  Me and my GOB team can argue about the numbers, but I have no problem giving up some or all of *my* licensing rights and/or royalties to a good cause, of which the webhosting fees of www.gameofbands.com is quite reasonable, for example.\n\nSo I'm arguing that we (GOB) do it, and that by doing it we'll set a precedent for other /r/'s and beyond, which is a really spiffy idea that a lot of people are thinking about, hint hint.\n\n[GOB has a chatroom](http://webchat.snoonet.com/?channels=gameofbands) that I'm in ([radioreddit too](http://radioreddit.com/chat.php)), ifn anyone wants to talk about these ideas.  Sorry for the novel, it's a simple idea w/ complex implications, as so many are.  :D\n\nTL;DR: There's an easy way to monetize music on Reddit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347860576", "subreddit": "gameofbands", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This scoring seems very arbitrary, they drop canola down based on GMOs, pesticides and that the processing damages the omega-3's (oxidation). GMOs is a non-issue, [pesticides are used on olives too](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7886254), and the oxidation levels in canola seems to be lower than in olive oil on average.\n\n\nI posted this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/zhr13/fats_question/c64vsmd):\n\n---\n\nI'm not so sure that canola is that bad, the omega-6:3 ratio is very good, it's high in monounsaturated fat. Some standard values (these vary a bit, so you could possibly find better versions):\n\n[Canola oil](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=canola+oil+100+gram) is roughly 64% monounsaturated, 16% omega-6, 8% saturated and 6% omega-3.  \n[Olive oil](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=olive%20oil%20100%20grams) is roughly 73% monounsaturated, 10% omega-6, 14% saturated and 0.7% omega-3.\n\nAnd canola doesn't seem to oxidize that easily despite the omega-6/3 (depends on what marker you look at, and what brand you use), and there's cold pressed canola if you're still worried about the processing.\n\nI haven't looked at it in depth, but from [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/zdrlo/what_the_hell_keto_i_have_been_on_keto_for_6/c63yi13):\n\n---\n\nI haven't seen any studies that quantify how bad the oxidation of the oil is, how much does it increase risk with an increase of x \"oxidation units\"? Anyway, a quick look at a study:\n\n&gt; Oxidation of edible oils occurs when MUFA and PUFA, which are mainly glycerol bound, react with atmospheric O2. Primary oxidation products, hydroperoxides, are formed through different chemical mechanisms (12). The hydroperoxides will further break down into secondary oxidation products (aldehydes, ketones, alkenals etc). Several of them possess toxic properties. Eventually, tertiary oxidation products (short chain free fatty acids) may be formed. These oxidation reactions may be accelerated by the presence of metals and by exposure to heat and light.\n\n*Halvorsen BL, Blomhoff R.* [\"Determination of lipid oxidation products in vegetable oils and marine omega-3 supplements.\"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21691461/) *Food Nutr Res. 2011;55. doi: 10.3402/fnr.v55i0.5792.
