{"body": "**Leave** - I wish I did.  I graduated class of 2001.  I kept going because I didn't know what else to do - leaving meant failing and I had never failed at anything.  My experience as an officer only intensified my feelings - I was a surface nuke.  I had good and bad captains - the quality of your life depends so much on their personal qualities.  You will have good and bad sailors - the bad sailors will try to ruin your life; you won't feel qualified to lead the best sailors.\n\nTo summarize, *I can empathize with you*. Here is how I became a nuke:  I failed my service selection interview (one of two in my class of 920) because I couldn't come up with a reason I wanted to be a surface warfare officer.  Here I am a firstie with a 3.9 in EE and they start the separation process.  My roommate suggests I try a nuke interview.  I go to Naval Reactors get asked a basic calculus question and 30 minutes later Admiral Bowman welcomes me to the nuclear navy.  The academy stops the separation process.\n\nEnough with the problems - I think you understand them.  What you really want is a path forward. \n\n*  Serving in the military isn't the only way to serve.  It may not be the best way for you to help your fellow man.  Contributing to society is important; we are social animals.  Do not let the military convince you that they have a monopoly on this.\n\n*  Continuing at the academy is actually being \"soft.\" Leaving actually means more work/risk/pain.  I am guilty of being soft too.  You are paralyzed by fear right now, you need to start working to create **options.**  Start applying to other schools - get an option lined up.  It will make your decision making a lot easier.\n*  Follow [Ryan Holiday](http://www.ryanholiday.net/).  He is on [Reddit too](http://www.reddit.com/user/ryan_holiday).

{"body": "Edit: [Polygon's is up too](http://www.polygon.com/game/far-cry-3/2723) - 9/10\n\n---\n\nI'm so hyped now. Especially since I was a convert from the \"I hate Far Cry 2\" camp to the \"[I liked Far Cry 2 and had a blast](http://majorslack.com/games-tips-tricks/having-fun-playing-far-cry-2/)\" camp.\n\nI'm curious how problematic it is. I mean, you are a whitebread broseph from Cali, and the E3 trailer was just a biiiiiiiiiiiit exploitative (/understatement). What gives me hope is lots of the reviews (like IGN) have very high praise for the character writing and acting. Edit: I forgot that most of the marketing ([Steam page for example](http://store.steampowered.com/app/220240/)) is \"FAR CRY 3? MORE LIKE FAR CRY INSANE! LOOK AT HOW INSANE THE BAD GUY IS! LOOK HOW INSANE THIS DRUG TRIP IS! WATCH HOW YOU DELVE INTO INSANITY! THIS TIGER IS INSANE! THIS GRASS IS INSANE! THERES SO MUCH INSANE INSANITY IN THIS GAME!\" le sigh.\n\nEdit: some clips from Polygon's review which also earned them (even more) respect in my book since I havent seen a review yet mention it:\n\n&gt;Far Cry 3 attempts to set up Jason’s motivations for revenge and a thirst for the power to take out the over-the-top crazy Vaas and his pirate gang. But it quickly devolves into clichés about the corrupting influence of the savage wild, and plays directly into the white savior trope. \n\n&gt;Ubisoft Montreal seems to want to point at what you’re doing and ask, \"Isn’t this fucked up?\" But the story fails to sell Jason’s growing detachment or discomfort over that detachment, and what’s left often felt exploitative and pointless, dotted with misogyny and homophobia that only works for shock value. Is this hamfisted presentation of problematic imagery and, honestly, gross stereotypes, an issue unique to Far Cry 3? Well, no — see Resident Evil 5, for example. It’s not even unique to video games. The portrayal of post-colonial themes and Western encroachment on other cultures is something that storytelling aimed at mass markets has had a lot of trouble with for decades. But that doesn’t make it easier for me to swallow it here.\n\nHey [Arthur Gies](http://www.polygon.com/users/aegies), [](/getin)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353527895", "subreddit": "SRSGaming", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
