Angels Knoll park (the bench where they shot 500 days of summer)\nextra: 11: eat at the Grand Central market (right across the street from Angel Knoll) there are so many cultural food and they are all cheap. \n\nBUT actually my favorite things about Southern California lies outside of LA. \n\nHere are my [top unusual places in Southern California!](http://onecoolthingeveryweekend.com/2012/11/05/9-best-unusual-things-to-do-in-southern-california/)\n\n1.

{"body": "I highly recommend the [Franklin Park Conservatory](http://www.fpconservatory.org/). They have art by [Dale Chihuly](http://www.chihuly.com/Data/Sites/2/PhotoInline/Bellagio_daleB.jpg) all over, because he has a pretty big connection to Columbus. Also, they do a holiday themed thing with lights and decorations - it's very cool. \n\nAlong similar lines, the [Columbus Zoo](http://www.colszoo.org/) does Wild Lights, where the zoo is decorated with lights. It's very pretty, and I take my wife there every year.\n\nBoth of those recommendations are leisurely-paced. If you're looking for something more exciting, I recommend taking a look at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/h4vsk/hey_columbus_where_are_the_best_places_in_town_to/) about Columbus' live jazz scene. \n\nNot a club atmosphere, but visiting [the Newport](http://www.promowestlive.com/index_columbus.php?venue=new) is kind of a right of passage for Columbus. It's a...small...concert venue. It's a fun visit. Also on that website, you can check out the band schedule for The Basement, The LC Pavillion and A&amp;R Music Bar. \n\nFor other options, check out [Woodlands Tavern](http://www.reverbnation.com/venue/woodlandstavern), [Brothers Drake Meadery](http://www.brothersdrake.co/index/events/) - I linked straight to their events page, [Skully's](http://www.skullys.org/calendar.html), the Ravari Room, or [Ruby Tuesday](http://www.rubytuesdaylive.com/). \n\nFor food: Just like everyone else has mentioned - you *need* to see North Market. Get Jeni's ice cream while you're there, trust me. For food trucks, check out [Ohio Food Truck Finder](http://www.ohiofoodtruckfinder.com/) - it compiles the twitter accounts of many prominent food trucks, and you can find current locations for most. Not to be self-promoting (okay, maybe a little), [here's a list of Columbus food trucks](http://columbusfoodandbeer.blogspot.com/p/food-trucks-of-columbus.html) on my blog, with links to many. \n\nMy personal favorites? I recommend Ray Ray's, which stays put at the Ace of Cups. Mya's Fried Chicken is amazing. Tatoheads can do no wrong. For burgers: That Food Truck, Hungry Monkey, Street Thyme, or the Paddy Wagon. \n\nVegetarian places - NorthStar Cafe, like others have mentioned. Hal &amp; Al's has great vegetarian bar food. Dirty Frank's isn't inherently vegetarian, but they have vegetarian options. If you like Chicago-style hot dogs, Dirty Franks is a must-visit. A few more veggie options: Udipi Cafe, ZPizza, Taj Mahal, and Betty's.\n\nFor more inspiration, [take a look at this](http://www.columbusunderground.com/top-ten-things-to-do-in-columbus-ohio) (old) article on Columbus Underground. I second seeing German Village, and stress that you check out [The Book Loft](http://www.bookloft.com/).\n\nHope this has been helpful!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354646318", "subreddit": "Columbus", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; We know that reducing and banning guns does not reduce crime. It didn't work in Australia, the UK, or Canada. These counties still have just as much crime as the US per-capita and yet these countries have essentially banned all guns. \n\nI'm sorry, but in the case of the UK, that simply isn't true.  Firstly, you say crime, not violent crime.  Every country has lots of crime, but the main focus is that of violent crime.  It's also difficult to say that there's as much (violent) crime per capita between the UK and US, as what's deemed as violent differs between the two countries. For instance, robbing a store in the US with a fake plastic gun is classed as a crime.  In the UK, it's classed as a violent crime.  So two crimes have been committed, but in the UK, the stats in terms of violent crime have gone up, but they haven't in the US.\n\nSecondly, only handguns are banned in the UK.\n\nBut let's look at the three main areas; crime, violent crime and homicides. I'll be focussing on England &amp; Wales, \nas Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own laws, and record their own crime stats and thus there is no \"UK crime stats\".   E&amp;W are, by far, the largest group in terms of population, so that's why I'm choosing that as my source, rather than investigation the crime levels of 3 separate resources.  It would also be a disservice to include NI crime stats, especially violent crime and homicide, because of paramilitary groups in NI, that vastly skew those stats. To include those stats would be like including 9/11 homicides in NYC's total homicides.  It's just \nrepresentative.\n\n**Crime**:\n\nCrime in E&amp;W is at its lowest for 30 years, and has fallen by a third in the past decade alone.\n\n&gt; Overall crime recorded by police forces in England and Wales dropped to 3.9million offences in the year to June, \nthe Office for National Statistics show.\n\nhttp://www.metro.co.uk/news/915451-crime-in-england-and-wales-has-fallen-by-a-third-over-last-decade-say-police\n\n&gt; Crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales fell by 6.1% between the years ending June 2011 and June 2012, according to the latest crime statistics.\n\n&gt; 9.1m crimes were reported in 2011/12, down from 9.7m the previous year, and 27.2% lower than ten years ago.\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/14/crime-statistics-england-wales\n\n**Violent Crime**:\n\nLike crime, [violent crime is down too](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Violent-crime-rates-UK-\n\n1981-to-2007.png), and that can be seen in hospital records, as well as police records.\n\n&gt; The number of people treated in hospital after violent injury fell in England and Wales in 2010, an annual and \nauthoritative study says. [...] The study says the overall trend in violence has now fallen for a decade.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13117337\n\n&gt; There were around an estimated 1.2 million violent incidents which resulted in injury in 2010/11.  This is \nsimilar to the level of five years previously but much less than the level of a decade ago.\n\n&gt; http://www.poverty.org.uk/87/index.shtml\n\nNot all violent crime involves guns, however, does show a downward decline. How much is hard to say, because the recording of firearm crime changed in 2002.  Because of that change, gun crime did appear to increase massively, but in reality it didn't change with any significance.  It's also the reason many gun-advocates mistakenly believe gun crime spiked after the handgun ban, but it's simply not true.\n\n&gt; While the number of crimes involving firearms in England and Wales increased from 13,874 in 1998/99 to 24,070 in 2002/03, they remained relatively static at 24,094 in 2003/04, and fell to 21,521 in 2005/06. The latter includes 3,275 crimes involving imitation firearms and 10,437 involving air weapons, compared to 566 and 8,665 respectively in 1998/99.[56] Only those \"firearms\" positively identified as being imitations or air weapons (e.g., by being recovered by the police or by being fired) are classed as such, so the actual numbers are likely to be significantly higher\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime.\n\n[This article also makes the mistake of not accounting for the change in recording of gun crime]\n(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6438601/Gun-crime-doubles-in-a-decade.html), with its sensationalist headline.  It's only until you get to the bottom of the article, that it points towards the changes in recording.\n\n&gt; A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"It is misleading to compare figures for 2007 / 08 with those from 2002 and \nbefore, due to changes in recording practices. [...]There has been an 11 per cent fall in gun crime since 2005 and provisional figures for firearm offences recorded by the police show they account for 0.2 per cent of all recorded crime.\n\nThis BBC News article goes into a bit more detail about those changes:\n\n&gt; Official statisticians say it is not possible to compare violent crime stats before and after April 2002 because \nof a big change in the way such incidents were recorded.\n\n&gt; Before 2002 the decision as to whether an incident was a violent crime had been taken by police. After 2002, \nofficers were obliged to record all incidents as violent crimes if the alleged victim said that is what it was. The \naim was to stop police fiddling the figures and to get a better picture of violence. The obvious consequence was to send the raw numbers shooting up.\n\n&gt; A warning printed on recorded crime stats after April 2002 says that \"figures before and after that date are not \ndirectly comparable\".\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/02/conservative_estimates_on_viol_1.html\n\n**Homicide**:\n\nLike both types of crime, homicide rates have declined.  In fact they're at their lowest for 30 years.  More importantly, homicides involving firearms are at their lowest in 20 years.\n\n&gt; The number of murders and killings in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, Office for National Statistics figures show.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18900384\n\n&gt; The number of deaths in Britain from gunshot wounds has fallen to a 20-year low despite concerns about levels of violent crime.\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-records-18-fall-in-gun-deaths-1232069.html\n\nIt's worth noting at this point, that in 1997, 15 years ago, handguns were banned in the UK, after the [Dunblane massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre).  This wasn't just the banning of sales, it was also the banning of owning them (with exceptions for some antique handguns and black-powder revolvers).\n\nDoes that mean that is solely down the fact that because handguns were banned that homicides went down?  No. However, it's most certainly a major factor.  It may even have been a major factor the further reduction of violent crime (and crime by proxy).\n\nBecause of the banning of handguns, gun amnesties have been held, where you can bring in any guns you're in possession of with no questions asked.  This has resulted in tens of thousands of weapons being handed in.\n\nIn 1996, after the Dunblane Massacre, a gun amnesty was held, in which [~23,000 illegal weapons and ~700,000 rounds of ammunition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_3110000/3110949.stm) were handed in. Another amnesty was held in 2003 brought in [25,000 weapons and 500,000 rounds of ammunition](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/may/01/ukguns.immigrationpolicy). They were so successful that several other amnesties have been held for other types of weapon.\n\nIf we compare the US and UK, solely in terms of firearms deaths, there is a very alarming statistic. In 2010  there were [8,875 firearm murders in the US](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10shrtbl08.xls).  In the [UK there were 58](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0212/), twelve of which were due to the [mass shooting (involving legally-owned rifles) in Cumbria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria_shootings).\n\nEdit:  Weird formatting issue.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355920109", "subreddit": "guns", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}
