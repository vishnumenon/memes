We cannot imagine things into existence. It doesn't work that way.\n\nThe primary problem with the ontological argument is that it is circular.

Your premise is your conclusion. Your argument is circular.

They also have pretty solid pub food.\n\n* You could go wine tasting (the wine is pretty good!) at [Wildcat Creek Winery](http://www.wildcatcreekwinery.com/)\n\n* [The Egyptian](http://www.yelp.com/biz/egyptian-cafe-west-lafayette) has hookah and pretty decent food.\n\n* [Harry's](http://www.harryschocolateshop.com/) is kind of the alumni bar when it's not the weekend but, on the other hand, their drinks are insanely strong and relatively cheap.\n\nLafayette:\n\n* If you want to eat pizza and dance (classy dancing, check the ballroom) then hit up [Sylvia's Brick Oven and Columbia Ballroom](http://sylviasbrickoven.com/Home_Page.html). I should add that I'm from Chicago and the only place I found to have really good pizza here has now closed, sorry!\n\n* Want to try a bunch of different beers? Hit up [Chumley's](http://www.chumleysbarlafayette.com/). They have something over 150 beers there.\n\n* [Adelino's](http://www.adelinos.com/) has live jazz and tapas food.\n\n* You could get cheap and super delicious BBQ Food at the [South Street Smokehouse](https://plus.google.com/108795884229403948730/about?hl=en ).\n\n* Super crazy food (think smaller versions of epic meal time) + bears/cubs bar at [DT Kirby's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dt-kirbys-lafayette).\n\n* You could play pinball at the (new) [Main Street Amusements](http://www.msamuse.com/). I like going there drunk.\n\n* [Virtuous Cycles](http://www.virtuouscycles.us/) is a great bike shop if you need help/parts and the owners are incredibly friendly.\n\n* You could catch the local critical mass biking event if they're still going on in the winter. Those are fun if you like to bike with a bunch of people.\n\n* There is an RC airfield along this path I used to run on. Always fun to see the crazy stuff there. I'd probably have to make you a marker on Google maps to show you.\n\n* The [Columbia Park Zoo](http://www.lafayette.in.gov/zoo/) might be kind of cool. I've never been there but I hear they have otters! Otters!\n\nThere is so much more there that I just don't recall at the moment. I'll try to add some as they come up. Maybe someone can schedule a Reddit meetup for you? If you want more classy restaurants I can list those as well. Not sure what you're looking for.\n\nIf you want to chill I'd be down for going for some live music + whiskey/cigar pairing (or whatever really) at [The Knickerbocker Saloon](http://www.knickerbockersaloon.com/home/) in Lafayette.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358355402", "subreddit": "Purdue", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I really like this feature, it helps with docking when I need to rotate the craft or if the docking port is radially mounted. And docking on the dark side isn't all that terrible. :) When your two vessels are magnetically locked, but the SAS is still on, use this time to use Q and E to rotate your vessel so that it is oriented in the right way. This helps for panels and such so they're all lined up.\n\nThere's a bug though - whenever I use this feature, my target marker on my navball does not point me towards the docking port, but slightly off to the side or off into f nowhere entirely.  This was driving me insane the first 2 times I tried to dock.  Third time I stopped doing it, and all of a sudden my target was pointing me directly at the docking port of choice.  Hooray!\n\nBut then that prevents me from say..  okay.  Say I have a big space station with 10 docking ports, and a small ship is approaching.  Say I am in control of the space station, and I want to rotate it slightly, so that one of the docking ports (not at the nose) points at the approaching small craft.\n\nHow do I do that?  If I set the approaching craft's docking port as a target, the \"nose\" of my space station will point at the approaching craft.  How do I get one of my docking ports to point at it?  I thought that the \"control from here\" functionality did that, but that never worked for me, like I said - it just meant that things were pointing in seemingly random directions.\n\n[Other people have seen the \"control from here\" bug too](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31553-Control-from-here-origin-still-at-command-pod).  Maybe you are designing your spacecraft differently if you are not seeing it?  Are you ever putting your docking ports anywhere but not on the \"nose\" of your ship?\n\nI really want to know because docking seems impossible with larger craft.  Small ones I can probably do, but that won't really help me build the ships I want to build in orbit for my future missions.\n\nSomebody also told me that the magnetic forces won't kick in with SAS on.  I've seen this happen, I think, before I heard that.  I had my docking ports touching at a 10-20 degree difference in how they were pointing.  According to one guy, if I had my SAS turned off, that would have docked.  With SAS on, nope.  Any truth to that?\n\n&gt; From what I've noticed, it points at your docking point, but it does not take in to account if you're on the wrong side or not. I find this features really handy, actually.\n\nOh, if that's how it worked I would be able to dock fine.  But like I said, whenever I use the \"control from here\" feature, with a docking port on another vessel as a target, and I align myself to point at the target on the navball, I'll either be pointing just slightly off to the side of the docking port, making the target marker useless, or it'll point to butt fuck nowhere, just leading to laughter and frustration.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359036207", "subreddit": "KerbalSpaceProgram", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
