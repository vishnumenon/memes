{"body": "Downtown Lafayette is awesome; I currently live there. Going to repost something (with improvements!) I posted earlier but it should apply:\n\nThere is a lot more to do in Lafayette than West Lafayette but I'm going to mention some West Lafayette things anyways. Also, Lafayette has way more bars, restaurants and shops; not to mention the bars are way more chill. You should really just wander around downtown Lafayette for awhile. On some weekends there are special events, like Mosey Down Mainstreet or the Blues/Jazz Festival, but I don't know what's currently going on.\n\nWest Lafayette:\n\n* One of the best places to get a Guinness in the United States is [Nine Irish Brothers](http://www.nineirishbrothers.com/). They also have pretty solid pub food.\n\n* You could go wine tasting (the wine is pretty good!) at [Wildcat Creek Winery](http://www.wildcatcreekwinery.com/)\n\n* [The Egyptian](http://www.yelp.com/biz/egyptian-cafe-west-lafayette) has hookah and pretty decent food.\n\n* [Harry's](http://www.harryschocolateshop.com/) is kind of the alumni bar when it's not the weekend but, on the other hand, their drinks are insanely strong and relatively cheap.\n\nLafayette:\n\n* If you want to eat pizza and dance (classy dancing, check the ballroom) then hit up [Sylvia's Brick Oven and Columbia Ballroom](http://sylviasbrickoven.com/Home_Page.html). I should add that I'm from Chicago and the only place I found to have really good pizza here has now closed, sorry!\n\n* Want to try a bunch of different beers? Hit up [Chumley's](http://www.chumleysbarlafayette.com/). They have something over 150 beers there.\n\n* Lafayette now has a new brewery called [People's Brewery](http://www.peoplesbrew.com/). You might want to check that out.\n\n* [The Black Sparrow](http://www.blacksparrowpub.com/) is kind of a hipster bar but they have a great tap selection and pretty good food.\n\n* [Avidity](http://www.aviditybar.com/) has pretty solid cocktails and is pretty chill in general.\n\n* Live music + whiskey/cigar pairing (or whatever really) at [The Knickerbocker Saloon](http://www.knickerbockersaloon.com/home/)\n\n* [Adelino's](http://www.adelinos.com/) has live jazz and tapas food.\n\n* You could get cheap and super delicious BBQ Food at the [South Street Smokehouse](https://plus.google.com/108795884229403948730/about?hl=en ).\n\n* Super crazy food (think smaller versions of epic meal time) + bears/cubs bar at [DT Kirby's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dt-kirbys-lafayette).\n\n* You could play pinball at the (new) [Main Street Amusements](http://www.msamuse.com/). I like going there drunk.\n\n* [Virtuous Cycles](http://www.virtuouscycles.us/) is a great bike shop if you need help/parts and the owners are incredibly friendly.\n\n* You could catch the local critical mass biking event if they're still going on in the winter. Those are fun if you like to bike with a bunch of people.\n\n* There is an RC airfield along this path I used to run on. Always fun to see the crazy stuff there. I'd probably have to make you a marker on Google maps to show you.\n\n* The [Columbia Park Zoo](http://www.lafayette.in.gov/zoo/) might be kind of cool. I've never been there but I hear they have otters! Otters!\n\n* If you have a dog the [Shamrock Dogpark](http://www.dogparkinlafayette.org/) is pretty solid.\n\nThere is so much more there that I just don't recall at the moment. I'll try to add some as they come up. Maybe someone can schedule a Reddit meetup for you? If you want more classy restaurants I can list those as well.

{"body": "My personal taste is drugs/money/girls rap. That's what I like. But to pretend like that means everything is all the same is crazy. Almost every major city has it's own distinguishable sounds and themes. \n\nI'm sure someone else can step in and give you tons of sad raps or party raps or robots and spaceships raps. \n\nHere's whatever I can think of from the last few years in random ass order\n\n[Danny Brown is my favorite rapper at the moment. His last album explores the drugs/bitches/money shit with a different light. Sometimes it's fun and sexy and sometimes it's ugly and harsh.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J--rO7FP16U)\n\nKendrick Lamar is probably the most successful, interesting rapper at the moment. His most recent album is the best thing out at the moment in my opinion.\n \n[Here's a song off of it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqdbxlMlddw)\n\n[And another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yR7VB9FpJI)\n\nKendrick's crew members are great as well. Here's some more thought-provoking shit from them.\n\n[Ab-Soul talking about double standards in the culture.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Y3e4OPUbM)\n\n[ScHoolboy Q on some heart-felt shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9bsJ7oGokg) though I like him better when he's [wylin out and getting ugly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRpOY94upg) though that song is just as thought provoking imo\n\n[ASAP is really good at making songs that just feel like you're high as fuck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6I2Ek_j_Xc)\n\n[Roc Marciano says pretty things, but it's all about the feeling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVm5b9TFi_Y)\n\n[Chief Keef is pure adolescence and aggression good or bad. Sometimes it's hard to look at it, but it's true to what it is. This is what Chicago is right now.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WcRXJ4piHg)\n\n[Chicago has some very young girls rapping well too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgbW6SYq0YY)\n\nAn interesting aspect in the young girls in Chicago is these girls talking about guys the way that lots of rapper refer to women. [In this song she yells \"eat the team\".](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQKgNq9UoJE)\n\n[The intro to Meek Mill's newest album is crazy and a good example of story-telling + aggression](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yR7VB9FpJI)\n\n[Gibbs is just good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbxcPy1qJTU)\n\n[Action Bronson is pure luxury fantasy rap and Riff Riff is absurdism at it's best in recent rap imo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ohbKidZLiA)\n\nIn the last few years, a few gay rappers have been gaining traction and breaking barriers and it's pretty interesting to watch.\n\n[Mykki is dope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQ7CRJNti0)\n\n[but Le1f is cool too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrnq4SZ0luc)\n\nWith all that said, I recognize that I grew up on this music and that I'm more sensitive to skill / nuance / innovation within the genre than an outsider would be. In the same way that I probably could not accurately review Black Metal or Bluegrass, because I have a very superficial grasp of the music and the culture surrounding it. I'm just trying to explain why it's so frustrating to see people say that rap is just this or that.\n\nedit: Also, I'm not of the opinion that the underground was ever super necessary to find good hip-hop, but either way the underground means something else now. The internet has levelled the playing field by a LOT. And hip-hop is very popular right now. Every artist I listed up there is easy enough to run into without much digging. I didn't mention anything super deep into any corner of rap or city because a lot of that shit is less acessible.\n\nedit: and I didn't even mention all of the interesting producers, I thought it was shitty you even went at that.

{"body": "I'm a big advocate for hands on experience. Volunteering, internships, any way to get your foot in the door. \n\nI've had a lot volunteer experience. I also went to Cat Tales Zoological training center. One of just a few places in the US that trains specifically for animal keeping (and the only that specializes in big cats). After graduation, I had two job offers, and ended up moving to California to train lions and tigers for the movie industry. It was all hands on, free contact with adult big cats. I'm currently in between jobs and looking for a new opportunity.\n\nThe three schools I recommend checking out (in order of my recommendation) are:\n\n* [Cat Tales Zoological Training Center](http://www.zooschool.org/)\n* [Moorpark College Exotic Animal Training and Management](http://www.moorparkcollege.edu/current_students/teaching_zoo/index.shtml)\n* [Sante Fe College Teaching Zoo](http://www.sfcollege.edu/zoo/)\n\nGraduates from Cat Tales have ended up working for Out of Africa Wildlife Park, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, Seigfried and Roy's Secret Garden, Predators in Action, Point Defiance Zoo, Cougar Mountain Zoo, LEO Zoological Conservation Center, and many more.\n\nGraduates from Moorpark College have gone on to work for Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, Busch Gardens, Predators in Action, Hollywood Animals, Animal Actors of Hollywood, Tiger World NC, Seigfried and Roy's Secret Garden, and more.\n\nDo you need a degree? It depends on where you want to work. Some zoos require it, some facilities won't even ask. This industry is all about hard work and dedication.

{"body": "Edit: First and foremost, there's a difference between complaining AT a client, and complaining ABOUT clients who are not around. Complaining AT a client is definitely rude... Back to your regularly scheduled wall-of-text.  \n  \nLet me provide another perspective. I'm not an artist, but here's what I've gathered from getting to know my artist and other artists well.  \n  \nSpend your entire life slaving away to learning a skill. Put in 25 hours a day of effort. Draw **all the time**, whenever you aren't working your ass off on other tattoo related things. Get an apprenticeship and be treated like an indentured servant so that SOME DAY! you can go and practice your craft on your own.  \n  \nWhen you've finally made it, and you're excited to practice your craft, what happens? You see the same shit day in and day out. Cliche text tattoos; bird silhouettes; white ink tattoos; watercolors; and so forth every single day from people who \"just want a little tattoo\" on a whim. You're treated like an extension of the machine instead of an artist.  \n  \nWhat do you **really** want to do? Create. Build a portfolio of amazing and respectable pieces. Get into books. Get featured. Win awards. Be booked a year in advanced with huge beautiful pieces. Granted some artists really love doing small and traditional pieces, but even they tend to work them *into* the big stuff! It's really hard to become respected and learn how to master huge pieces when nobody is bringing you decent pieces. You desperately want to create something significant, and something that's distinctly *you*.  \n  \nBut here comes another girl on her 18th birthday who wants an infinity symbol with \"love\" in it on her wrist written in white ink.  \n  \nNow, I understand that artists don't have the luxury of turning these down a lot of times. But it gets old when you've dedicated your life to excellence, and someone who saw a picture on Pinterest 30 minutes ago and decided they NEEDED IT thinks they know more than you. It's something you *have* to do, so you get a little frustrated and vent to your fellow artists. Tattoo culture is known for being kind of rough in general (which might be another issue; polite people entering a surly world with varied expectations).  \n  \nBesides the issue of stifled talent, a portfolio of identical pieces, and being treated like an extension of a machine instead of a creator, there's also the issue that a lot of these tattoo ideas are just bad for a reason. A white ink tattoo isn't going to age as well as one with nice, thick, bold lines. An artist is literally putting their signature on a body every time they do a piece, and they want to ensure it's going to age well and stay beautiful for years to come. A lot of these new \"popular pieces\" don't lend themselves well to aging. It's a risk.  \n  \nI feel like my artist has the perfect mix of snobbery and professionalism. Some artists overdo the snobbery, but honestly there is definitely merit to getting upset about having to do your 90th [infinity symbol tattoo](http://i.imgur.com/lyqbbxY.jpg).
