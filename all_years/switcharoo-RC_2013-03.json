{"body": "Well, here's my time to shine.\n\nAssuming you have a PS3, since you were looking at GT5, here are your console choices:\n\n**GT5** - Great, amazing game, but the NASCAR content is lacking, and it's outdated. BUT - the online is very reliable, and if you're pretty much just interested in running Daytona, you can get with some friends or other trusted people and have lots of fun! (you can also create private rooms) The set-ups are very in depth, too. The great thing about GT5 is that if you aren't feeling in the NASCAR mood, you have over a thousand other cars to choose from and race around different tracks in. The versatility of GT5 is insanely good.\n\n**NTG: Inside Line** - Now you have a actual NASCAR - specific game, no other cars available. It has all of the tracks the Sprint cup races on, and a full 43 car field offline. (16 online like GT5). The offline is pretty good, and the career mode has at least some depth to it. The set-ups can get as in-depth as you want them to, also. Another plus is that you can paint your own NASCAR cars. On the downside though, the online is mostly shit. They've improved it since the patch, but restarts are still messed up, and other bugs still exist. Yes, it's come a long way since where it was a release, but it's not \"complete and fully functional\", as GT5's online is. However, if you get a group of friends that can race well, online isn't *that* bad, and it can be pretty fun. (you can create private rooms too)\n\nThose are really your two Ps3 console choices for NASCAR. I've put in ass loads of time into both, with being top level in GT5, and having a platinum trophy for Inside Line. Other choices include NASCAR 2009 (nope), and the first NASCAR The game (nope again).  Also, if your just looking for a good time,and not playing the PS3, NASCAR Thunder 2004 for the PS2 is probably my favorite NASCAR game of all time still. Soem other people have mentioned it too, I highly suggest it if you're up to using a PS2. Dirt to Daytona is also good for it's career, but the physics and other shit is just way too outdated and bad to play now, in my opinion. I also can't speak on behalf of PC games.\n\nBut there ya go. Hopefully that'll help you on the PS3 NASCAR side of things. If you had to make me pick, even though the NASCAR part is probably overall more better in Inside Line, GT5 is a hella better game overall. Get GT5.\n\nAlso: [Come join us at r/ps3!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3)\n\nAnd, there is a [subreddit for GT5 too](http://www.reddit.com/r/gt5)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364105417", "subreddit": "NASCAR", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My hair is straight, pixie-short, and bleached/toned platinum blond with violet highlights. My natural color was light brown. \n\nMy hair is very fine, but plentiful. It's now quite dry because of the color treatments. I LOVE IT. \n\nMy hair used to get incredibly oily after just one day and end up limp and gross. My scalp was scratchy and flaky more often than not, even though I used light weight shampoos/conditioners. I finally figured out much of my problem was the fact that I constantly touch my hair. I liked to flip it around, tuck it behind my ears, and fiddle with it. Hand oils = oily hair. Period.\n\nSo now that I chopped it all off and damaged it with bleach and such, I only shampoo every 3-4 days. Once in a while I'll just condition it on day 3 and see how that works through day 4-5 when I shampoo again. I always wet it every morning and use a leave-in conditioner to keep it smooth.

{"body": "Before I get back into the meat of my argument, I'd like to state that I don't want to detract from your enjoyment of the story, nor do I want to suggest that your tastes are wrong (just in case anyone reading this thinks otherwise). Everything I disliked about AoU #1 may be the things you loved and that's 100% fine by me.\n\n&gt; Days of Future Past was about mutant internment and time travel. The theme of the story was that the X-men had to protect a man who hated mutants to save them. The story was a vindication of Xavier ideals over the Magneto revolution.\n\nAbsolutely, you'll not hear me dispute that. Though I would predict that there's probably going to be [a bit of the ol' timeline jiggery-pokery to solve AoU too](/spoiler). Nor would I dispute this: \n\n&gt; Sentinels represent the presence of state control for marginalized people. \n\nbut while the allegory and themes of both stories are different, the tropes employed by Claremont and Bendis to tell the story are not. We're also getting away from the \"super slow-mo\" bit of my original comment too, and that's the deal-breaker for me. Bendis has taken his decompressed storytelling to a new height in AoU #1, I'm told #2 is even worse for it, and I simply can't justify spending $39.90 (10 issues x $3.99) on a story with the cathartic value of a 4 issue mini when I've seen so much of what it has to offer before. Some people dig it when he uses that style but I don't, it irritates me in the extreme and if I felt Bendis was giving us a totally fresh take on the post-robot-apocalypse sub-sub-genre then I'd still be reading it. \n\nUnfortunately for me, I've been around the block too many times for AoU to be worth the considerable cash outlay required to follow it to its conclusion.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364310353", "subreddit": "comicbooks", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
