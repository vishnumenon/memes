{"body": "Just to add to Blubbey's comment (taken from a previous comment of mine):\n\nEvery country has lots of crime, but the main focus is that of violent crime.  It's also difficult to say that there's as much (violent) crime per capita between the UK and US, as what's deemed as violent differs between the two countries. For instance, robbing a store in the US with a fake plastic gun is classed as a crime.  In the UK, it's classed as a violent crime.  So two crimes have been committed, but in the UK, the stats in terms of violent crime have gone up, but they haven't in the US.\n\nBut let's look at the three main areas; crime, violent crime and homicides. I'll be focussing on England &amp; Wales, \nas Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own laws, and record their own crime stats and thus there is no \"UK crime stats\".   E&amp;W are, by far, the largest group in terms of population, so that's why I'm choosing that as my source, rather than investigation the crime levels of 3 separate resources.  It would also be a disservice to include NI crime stats, especially violent crime and homicide, because of paramilitary groups in NI, that vastly skew those stats. To include those stats would be like including 9/11 homicides in NYC's total homicides.  It's just \nrepresentative.\n\n**Crime**:\n\nCrime in E&amp;W is at its lowest for 30 years, and has fallen by a third in the past decade alone.\n\n&gt; Overall crime recorded by police forces in England and Wales dropped to 3.9million offences in the year to June, \nthe Office for National Statistics show.\n\nhttp://www.metro.co.uk/news/915451-crime-in-england-and-wales-has-fallen-by-a-third-over-last-decade-say-police\n\n&gt; Crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales fell by 6.1% between the years ending June 2011 and June 2012, according to the latest crime statistics.\n\n&gt; 9.1m crimes were reported in 2011/12, down from 9.7m the previous year, and 27.2% lower than ten years ago.\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/14/crime-statistics-england-wales\n\n**Violent Crime**:\n\nLike crime, [violent crime is down too](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Violent-crime-rates-UK-\n\n1981-to-2007.png), and that can be seen in hospital records, as well as police records.\n\n&gt; The number of people treated in hospital after violent injury fell in England and Wales in 2010, an annual and \nauthoritative study says. [...] The study says the overall trend in violence has now fallen for a decade.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13117337\n\n&gt; There were around an estimated 1.2 million violent incidents which resulted in injury in 2010/11.  This is \nsimilar to the level of five years previously but much less than the level of a decade ago.\n\n&gt; http://www.poverty.org.uk/87/index.shtml\n\nNot all violent crime involves guns, however, does show a downward decline. How much is hard to say, because the recording of firearm crime changed in 2002.  Because of that change, gun crime did appear to increase massively, but in reality it didn't change with any significance.  It's also the reason many gun-advocates mistakenly believe gun crime spiked after the handgun ban, but it's simply not true.\n\n&gt; While the number of crimes involving firearms in England and Wales increased from 13,874 in 1998/99 to 24,070 in 2002/03, they remained relatively static at 24,094 in 2003/04, and fell to 21,521 in 2005/06. The latter includes 3,275 crimes involving imitation firearms and 10,437 involving air weapons, compared to 566 and 8,665 respectively in 1998/99.[56] Only those \"firearms\" positively identified as being imitations or air weapons (e.g., by being recovered by the police or by being fired) are classed as such, so the actual numbers are likely to be significantly higher\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime.\n\n[This article also makes the mistake of not accounting for the change in recording of gun crime]\n(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6438601/Gun-crime-doubles-in-a-decade.html), with its sensationalist headline.  It's only until you get to the bottom of the article, that it points towards the changes in recording.\n\n&gt; A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"It is misleading to compare figures for 2007 / 08 with those from 2002 and \nbefore, due to changes in recording practices. [...]There has been an 11 per cent fall in gun crime since 2005 and provisional figures for firearm offences recorded by the police show they account for 0.2 per cent of all recorded crime.\n\nThis BBC News article goes into a bit more detail about those changes:\n\n&gt; Official statisticians say it is not possible to compare violent crime stats before and after April 2002 because \nof a big change in the way such incidents were recorded.\n\n&gt; Before 2002 the decision as to whether an incident was a violent crime had been taken by police. After 2002, \nofficers were obliged to record all incidents as violent crimes if the alleged victim said that is what it was. The \naim was to stop police fiddling the figures and to get a better picture of violence. The obvious consequence was to send the raw numbers shooting up.\n\n&gt; A warning printed on recorded crime stats after April 2002 says that \"figures before and after that date are not \ndirectly comparable\".\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/02/conservative_estimates_on_viol_1.html\n\n**Homicide**:\n\nLike both types of crime, homicide rates have declined.  In fact they're at their lowest for 30 years.  More importantly, homicides involving firearms are at their lowest in 20 years.\n\n&gt; The number of murders and killings in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, Office for National Statistics figures show.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18900384\n\n&gt; The number of deaths in Britain from gunshot wounds has fallen to a 20-year low despite concerns about levels of violent crime.\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-records-18-fall-in-gun-deaths-1232069.html\n\nIt's worth noting at this point, that in 1997, 15 years ago, handguns were banned in the UK, after the [Dunblane massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre).  This wasn't just the banning of sales, it was also the banning of owning them (with exceptions for some antique handguns and black-powder revolvers).\n\nDoes that mean that is solely down the fact that because handguns were banned that homicides went down?  No. However, it's most certainly a major factor.  It may even have been a major factor the further reduction of violent crime (and crime by proxy).\n\nBecause of the banning of handguns, gun amnesties have been held, where you can bring in any guns you're in possession of with no questions asked.  This has resulted in tens of thousands of weapons being handed in.\n\nIn 1996, after the Dunblane Massacre, a gun amnesty was held, in which [~23,000 illegal weapons and ~700,000 rounds of ammunition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_3110000/3110949.stm) were handed in. Another amnesty was held in 2003 brought in [25,000 weapons and 500,000 rounds of ammunition](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/may/01/ukguns.immigrationpolicy). They were so successful that several other amnesties have been held for other types of weapon.\n\nIf we compare the US and UK, solely in terms of firearms deaths, there is a very alarming statistic. In 2010  there were [8,875 firearm murders in the US](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10shrtbl08.xls).  In the [UK there were 58](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0212/), twelve of which were due to the [mass shooting (involving legally-owned rifles) in Cumbria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria_shootings).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365349576", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I find it's not much work to maintain at all.  Somebody with lots of different note-taking needs might benefit from using some tabs or something to organize sections, but for my use, the necessary stuff just kind of floats to the top.  I tend to carry around 25 cards at a time, and while that is already more than I need in a day, it could also easily scale up to much more [I tend to prioritize a slim pocket profile with my EDC items].\n\nBefore this, I was using whatever random Moleskine Cahier or Field Notes memo book I had at the time--usually the graph variety--and I was constantly annoyed that my notes were just a jumbled order in the sequence that I wrote them down in.  Plus, notes that I wanted \"forever\" [long-term to do list or slow-burning creative ideas, for instance] had to be copied over into new books, else I would need to track down the original journal.  This way it's always in the stack.\n\nWith the notecard system, I'll just write the card heading at the top left corner for easy categorization [colored cards could easily fill this role, too].  Some of my typical categories:\n\n* To Do\n* To Get [stuff to buy/acquire, etc.]\n* Lesson Plans [outlines for teaching]\n* Creative [puppet designs, etc.]\n\nI'll also write subcategories on the cards as necessary, for instance, a \"To Do\" card will include the day's date, and then I'll just add another date entry on that same card the next day.  New tasks go under that date, and I can still see the things that didn't get crossed off yesterday.  If I still have uncrossed items once I fill a card completely, I'm doing something wrong!\n\nOne benefit of having the binder-clipped stack is you have two quick-readable sides [front and back].  Those two tend to be my \"To Do\" and \"To Get\" cards, since those are the ones I most often need to assess at a glance.  But if I'm teaching a class, I will move my lesson plan outline to the top for the duration.\n\nThe biggest benefit of this system is it really is completely customizable to the user, and the possibilities for hacking it are pretty endless.  I'm confident that you could work something out for your purposes, but some people do just love the feel of a classic notebook in hand.

{"body": "&gt; but their violent crime rate is much higher than ours\n\nSo incredibly wrong.\n\nhttp://dispellingthemythukvsusguns.wordpress.com/\n\nHere's a comment I made a number of months back:\n\nEvery country has lots of crime, but the main focus is that of violent crime.  It's also difficult to say that there's as much (violent) crime per capita between the UK and US, as what's deemed as violent differs between the two countries. For instance, robbing a store in the US with a fake plastic gun is classed as a crime.  In the UK, it's classed as a violent crime.  So two crimes have been committed, but in the UK, the stats in terms of violent crime have gone up, but they haven't in the US.\n\nBut let's look at the three main areas; crime, violent crime and homicides. I'll be focussing on England &amp; Wales, \nas Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own laws, and record their own crime stats and thus there is no \"UK crime stats\".   E&amp;W are, by far, the largest group in terms of population, so that's why I'm choosing that as my source, rather than investigation the crime levels of 3 separate resources.  It would also be a disservice to include NI crime stats, especially violent crime and homicide, because of paramilitary groups in NI, that vastly skew those stats. To include those stats would be like including 9/11 homicides in NYC's total homicides.  It's just \nrepresentative.\n\n**Crime**:\n\nCrime in E&amp;W is at its lowest for 30 years, and has fallen by a third in the past decade alone.\n\n&gt; Overall crime recorded by police forces in England and Wales dropped to 3.9million offences in the year to June, \nthe Office for National Statistics show.\n\nhttp://www.metro.co.uk/news/915451-crime-in-england-and-wales-has-fallen-by-a-third-over-last-decade-say-police\n\n&gt; Crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales fell by 6.1% between the years ending June 2011 and June 2012, according to the latest crime statistics.\n\n&gt; 9.1m crimes were reported in 2011/12, down from 9.7m the previous year, and 27.2% lower than ten years ago.\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/14/crime-statistics-england-wales\n\n**Violent Crime**:\n\nLike crime, [violent crime is down too](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Violent-crime-rates-UK-\n\n1981-to-2007.png), and that can be seen in hospital records, as well as police records.\n\n&gt; The number of people treated in hospital after violent injury fell in England and Wales in 2010, an annual and \nauthoritative study says. [...] The study says the overall trend in violence has now fallen for a decade.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13117337\n\n&gt; There were around an estimated 1.2 million violent incidents which resulted in injury in 2010/11.  This is \nsimilar to the level of five years previously but much less than the level of a decade ago.\n\n&gt; http://www.poverty.org.uk/87/index.shtml\n\nNot all violent crime involves guns, however, does show a downward decline. How much is hard to say, because the recording of firearm crime changed in 2002.  Because of that change, gun crime did appear to increase massively, but in reality it didn't change with any significance.  It's also the reason many gun-advocates mistakenly believe gun crime spiked after the handgun ban, but it's simply not true.\n\n&gt; While the number of crimes involving firearms in England and Wales increased from 13,874 in 1998/99 to 24,070 in 2002/03, they remained relatively static at 24,094 in 2003/04, and fell to 21,521 in 2005/06. The latter includes 3,275 crimes involving imitation firearms and 10,437 involving air weapons, compared to 566 and 8,665 respectively in 1998/99.[56] Only those \"firearms\" positively identified as being imitations or air weapons (e.g., by being recovered by the police or by being fired) are classed as such, so the actual numbers are likely to be significantly higher\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime.\n\n[This article also makes the mistake of not accounting for the change in recording of gun crime]\n(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6438601/Gun-crime-doubles-in-a-decade.html), with its sensationalist headline.  It's only until you get to the bottom of the article, that it points towards the changes in recording.\n\n&gt; A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"It is misleading to compare figures for 2007 / 08 with those from 2002 and \nbefore, due to changes in recording practices. [...]There has been an 11 per cent fall in gun crime since 2005 and provisional figures for firearm offences recorded by the police show they account for 0.2 per cent of all recorded crime.\n\nThis BBC News article goes into a bit more detail about those changes:\n\n&gt; Official statisticians say it is not possible to compare violent crime stats before and after April 2002 because \nof a big change in the way such incidents were recorded.\n\n&gt; Before 2002 the decision as to whether an incident was a violent crime had been taken by police. After 2002, \nofficers were obliged to record all incidents as violent crimes if the alleged victim said that is what it was. The \naim was to stop police fiddling the figures and to get a better picture of violence. The obvious consequence was to send the raw numbers shooting up.\n\n&gt; A warning printed on recorded crime stats after April 2002 says that \"figures before and after that date are not \ndirectly comparable\".\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/02/conservative_estimates_on_viol_1.html\n\n**Homicide**:\n\nLike both types of crime, homicide rates have declined.  In fact they're at their lowest for 30 years.  More importantly, homicides involving firearms are at their lowest in 20 years.\n\n&gt; The number of murders and killings in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, Office for National Statistics figures show.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18900384\n\n&gt; The number of deaths in Britain from gunshot wounds has fallen to a 20-year low despite concerns about levels of violent crime.\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-records-18-fall-in-gun-deaths-1232069.html\n\nIt's worth noting at this point, that in 1997, 15 years ago, handguns were banned in the UK, after the [Dunblane massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre).  This wasn't just the banning of sales, it was also the banning of owning them (with exceptions for some antique handguns and black-powder revolvers).\n\nDoes that mean that is solely down the fact that because handguns were banned that homicides went down?  No. However, it's most certainly a major factor.  It may even have been a major factor the further reduction of violent crime (and crime by proxy).\n\nBecause of the banning of handguns, gun amnesties have been held, where you can bring in any guns you're in possession of with no questions asked.  This has resulted in tens of thousands of weapons being handed in.\n\nIn 1996, after the Dunblane Massacre, a gun amnesty was held, in which [~23,000 illegal weapons and ~700,000 rounds of ammunition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_3110000/3110949.stm) were handed in. Another amnesty was held in 2003 brought in [25,000 weapons and 500,000 rounds of ammunition](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/may/01/ukguns.immigrationpolicy). They were so successful that several other amnesties have been held for other types of weapon.\n\nIf we compare the US and UK, solely in terms of firearms deaths, there is a very alarming statistic. In 2010  there were [8,875 firearm murders in the US](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10shrtbl08.xls).  In the [UK there were 58](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0212/), twelve of which were due to the [mass shooting (involving legally-owned rifles) in Cumbria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria_shootings).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365524598", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

A bitter virgin.\n\nBut you said:\n\n&gt;I'm stuck in a catch-22 where women will fucking run away when they find out that I have little to no experience, \n\nOK. Do you advertise that though? the \"no experience\" part? How would she know? You have to *fake it til you make it* - nobody really cares if you're a virgin *if you can do everything else well*!!!!

{"body": "I frequently list *69 Love Songs* as my favorite album.  I'd even argue that it's the single greatest concept album of all time.\n\nIn *69 Love Songs*, Stephin Merritt succeeds in taking you through every single emotion felt over a truly passionate relationship.  Because of flexibility he has due to the genre-hopping, he manages to match the musical emotion of each song to the precise lyrics.  A quick tour:\n\n-[Asleep and Dreaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJsK2mSUwnM) functions as a true love song.  It's lyrics reflect someone who's deeply and madly in love with somebody: \"You may not be beautiful/ but it's not for me to judge./ I don't know if you're beautiful/ because I love you too much.\"  The classically romantic arrangement (provided by the author Lemony Snicket on this track, by the way) clearly reflects the lyrics here.\n\n-[My Only Friend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otslu_0esKs) reflects a time when the loneliness of being single sets in.  You begin to look towards music to cope with your loneliness: \"Hey Lady Day, can you save my life today?\"  The music is a wash of reverb and delay heavy piano tracks that completely envelop the listener.  The song immerses you in the music in the same way that the song's protagonist's music immerses him.\n\n-[Absolutely Cuckoo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxyhCm_vTMc) (the first song on the album) captures the excited, yet still hesitant, feeling of meeting someone great.  It's got Merritt's sharp comedic edge \"Give me a week or two to/ \nGo absolutely cuckoo /\nThen, when you see your error/\nThen you can flee in terror.\"\nHis music here perfectly reflects the excitement of falling in love with someone with his non-stop vocal delivery.  The recording is actually two takes of Stephin Merritt singing, alternating lines, because it's nearly impossible for one person to keep up with this song by them self.\n\nI could go on for the other 66, as well, but I think you get the point.  This is an incredibly clever and complex album.  There are more than enough straight-up fantastic songs (Busbey Berkeley Dreams, Grand Canyon, The Book of Love, Papa was a Rodeo, All My Words, I Don't Want to Get Over You) to carry the intimidated listener through this 3-hour monster.  Once you get deep enough into it, you'll want to completely immerse yourself in Merritt's world of strong melodies and bitingly true lyrics.  As he says on My Only Friend, \"Some of us can only live in songs of love and trouble/ some of us can only live in bubbles.\"  Amen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366113051", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "On point 6, I find this very hard to believe.  I've skim read the document, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it pretty much goes off crime figures, without even bothering to try and explain the differences in crime, except for a few brief sentences on page 7, and then decides to ignore the differences.  Without that, the whole report is flawed.  \n\nI don't know about the rest of those countries involved in the studies, but I know that England &amp; Wales is only wrongly accused of being more violent than the US, which is incorrect.  The reason being what the US considers violent crime is vastly different from what E&amp;W classes as violent crime. \n\n Also a major factor, is the higher under-reporting rate of crime and violent crime in the US.  So if you consider that more crimes are classed as violent and more crimes are reported in E&amp;W, then yes, the numbers do appear to be higher.  However, when you look at the data carefully, you'll see that the US has a lot more violent crime than E&amp;W. \n\nHere's a [much better source](http://dispellingthemythukvsusguns.wordpress.com/), that discusses the topics above and comes up with a more accurate reflection of violent crime in E&amp;W and the US.\n\nGiven that the report chooses to ignore that, I think it's probably incorrect for the other countries in the study too.\n\nSome other things of note.\n\nCrime in E&amp;W is currently at a 30-year-low:\n\n&gt; Overall crime recorded by police forces in England and Wales dropped to 3.9million offences in the year to June, \nthe Office for National Statistics show.\n\nhttp://www.metro.co.uk/news/915451-crime-in-england-and-wales-has-fallen-by-a-third-over-last-decade-say-police\n\n&gt; Crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales fell by 6.1% between the years ending June 2011 and June 2012, according to the latest crime statistics.\n\n&gt; 9.1m crimes were reported in 2011/12, down from 9.7m the previous year, and 27.2% lower than ten years ago.\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/14/crime-statistics-england-wales\n\nLike crime, [violent crime is down too](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Violent-crime-rates-UK-1981-to-2007.png), and that can be seen in hospital records, as well as police records.\n\n&gt; The number of people treated in hospital after violent injury fell in England and Wales in 2010, an annual and \nauthoritative study says. [...] The study says the overall trend in violence has now fallen for a decade.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13117337\n\n&gt; There were around an estimated 1.2 million violent incidents which resulted in injury in 2010/11.  This is \nsimilar to the level of five years previously but much less than the level of a decade ago.\n\n&gt; http://www.poverty.org.uk/87/index.shtml\n\nHomicide rates are also at their lowest for 30 years, and homicides involving firearms are at their lowest for 20 years:\n\n&gt; The number of murders and killings in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, Office for National Statistics figures show.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18900384\n\n&gt; The number of deaths in Britain from gunshot wounds has fallen to a 20-year low despite concerns about levels of violent crime.\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-records-18-fall-in-gun-deaths-1232069.html\n\n\nTL;DR; the report in point 6 appears to be incredibly flawed and should not be replied upon.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366613412", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I understand that not over fueling is important to keep the car light\n\nIndeed! In fact, as far as I've heard, teams tend to slightly underfill the cars - there's probably no car out there that can go from lights out to the chequered flag at completely full pelt. [And if you're looking for a right laugh, have a look out for the Virgin Racing car from a few years ago - they accidentally designed it with a fuel tank so small that they doubted it could finish a race at all!]\n\n&gt; What strategies and car settings are available to help measure and manage remaining fuel levels?\n\nIn terms of strategies the drivers can use to save fuel [by no means exhaustive]:\n\n- **Short shifting** - basically the driver shifts up the gears early, which aids fuel consumption. The lower the revs you use, the less fuel you use. [Short shifting and travelling in the highest gear possible also seems to be pretty effective in road cars at saving petrol, too].\n\n- **Lifting and coasting** - rather than going full pelt to the end of a straight and braking hard where they usually would, the driver would lift off the throttle early, and coast for a while, before braking for the corner. The aerodynamics do quite a lot to slow the car down, in any case. Stirling Moss used to say that the aerodynamics on a modern F1 car slow it down faster than his cars used to slow down under braking.\n\nIn terms of car settings, there's [I don't know much about this stuff - again, it's not exhaustive, either]:\n\n- **The 'mix' of the engine** - I'm not sure if you've played F1 2011, or F1 2012 on a games console, but one of the setting you can play about with in a session is the 'mix'. This basically controls the mix of fuel and air that goes into the engine, and some mix settings [mix 3 in the game] use greater amounts of fuel, but give a greater amount of speed. Others, of course,  use lower amounts of fuel, but make the car slower [mix 1 in the game]. If you ever listen to team radio in F1, and you hear a McLaren engineer telling his driver: \"Yellow G 4, Yellow Golf 4\", that's basically a mix setting on their cars [it's their slowest mix setting, and is most commonly used on the slowing-down lap after a race. It's also commonly issued with the command \"pick up rubber\" so that the driver remembers to pick up marbles on their tyres on the inlap.]\n\n- **Engine revs** - again, the lower the revs, the lower the consumption. Drivers may turn their engines down so that they don't use the full 19,000RPM at their disposal. This not only helps them save fuel, but also allows them, to an extent, to save the engine - something of massive importance when drivers may only use 8 engines in a season!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367088628", "subreddit": "formula1", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}
