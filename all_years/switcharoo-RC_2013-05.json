{"body": "When 20K characters just isn't enough...\n\n&gt;How is that not the government interfering with the economy?\n\nTorts aren't instances of economic freedom. LF differs from AC [which I am fairly cool with too] in specifying a gov't protecting negative rights as the back drop for the market. Even in AC I don't think anyone would say poisoning your well is an exercise of my economic liberty. For starters, in AC and for the most part LF, there isn't common property except property that is un-owned/utilized. So whose property you are damaging will be clear.\n\n&gt;They are priced waaay too low. Their extraction, refining, and \n&gt;distribution are directly subsidized,\n\nSubsidized how? As for standing armies, I'm no fan, so don't blame a system I favor. Unless demonstrate they were an implicit risk of a system I favor.\n\n&gt;We pay a ridiculous amount of money in foreign aid\n\nNot a system I favor.\n\n&gt;And then we pull a similar trick \n\nAgain ...\n\n&gt;Yes it will! But not until ecosystems are irreversibly damage or \n&gt;outright destroyed, and genetic diversity has collapsed.\n\nCoase has a lot to say that appears relevant and borne out historically. He suggests clear and well defined imposition of property rights solves for negative externalities.\n\n&gt;which you ignored.\n\nI did not! I read it, evaluated it and wondered whether or not Chart 2 was relevant to 3.\n\n&gt;So only those born into wealth are morally sanctioned to reproduce? \n\nOnly those who can provide for children should have them. Manna doesn't drop from the sky because you decided not to use a jimmy hat. What pie in the sky [literally] attitude amounts to \"Oh I'll have a kid since that's my moral right without respect to how I will feed, support, educate or socialize him?\"\n\nAnd from curiosity, do you think China's one child policy is bullshit?\n\n&gt;And that means when poor people reproduce it's okay that they \n&gt;suffer and die? \n\nIt means when people act w/o thought of consequence, the effect of insuring their choice to do so is moral corruption, changing their risk calculation with foreknowledge of your intention to save them. Due to biology, people who don't eat die. That fact should weigh on anyone planning to reproduce. As well as the other costs of raising a child.\n\nYou could extrapolate from what it takes to raise a child successfully to why a paternalist state is morally stultifying. I guess you are not a daddy. Am I right? Again, curiosity; this isn't any argument at all. \n\n&gt;This isn't morality, it's justification for eugenics. Blaming victims is \n&gt;bullying.\n\nThis eugenics/fascist BS is bullying. It has a chilling effect on dialogue because no one wants to have a civil conversation, in fact most people cannot continue one, when someone is screaming \"HATE CRIMES!!!\" in your face for having a different POV.\n\n&gt;They are both far right wing economically. \n\nIt's leftist rhetoric that fascism is portrayed as the polar opposite of communism. State control and intervention in economics is perfectly antithetical to LF. Fascism is predicated upon it. They couldn't be more different in principle. \n\nState violence is not so different than a union busting goon squad. However goon squads are illegal in LF; as they were in their heyday. Assault is no tool of free association. Just because a \"capitalist\" commits a crime, don't infer that capitalism is predicated upon criminal behavior.\n\n&gt;It goes against your narrative that we can't have both. We can. \n\nSmith thought the invisible hand was the road to pareto optimization. I think that. You think that your system does too. But when you start telling me all the infringements of liberty you're willing to accept in the name of utility, I have doubts. \n\nThe point is, yes, it is great if maximizing individual liberty does maximize net utility and vice versa, but the real questions arise when a situation occurs where a tension appears and prioritization must occur. \n\n&gt;Sweden has one of the most equal societies (I realize they outsource \n&gt;a lot of their inequity, and I welcome critical analysis like that)\n\nSweden has a homogenous culture and ethnic background. Sweden has disgruntled producers who think the taxes are too high; Astrid Lindgren springs to mind. Sweden has broad income distribution but high wealth inequality, higher than the European average. Sweden achieves that through a marginal tax rate approaching 57% an employer tax at 31% and a consumption tax and a VAT at 25%. Massive redistribution.\n\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21571136-politicians-both-right-and-left-could-learn-nordic-countries-next-supermodel\n\n&gt;What would result from UN sovereignty? ... I welcome thoughtful suggestions.\n\nBelgian waffles become the *in* dessert? Just look at the EU and UN. Free speech rights die. Redistributive justice becomes even more of a norm. Brussels dictates everything down to your underwear size. Slave running countries run human rights commissions. The UN is a mess beyond compare.\n\n&gt;And I'm an animist\n\nAre you a Peter Singer style utilitarian including rats in your utility calculus? I mean I could care less about your religious preferences, but if the end result is that your reverence for the non-human informs your policy preferences, it actually becomes relevant.\n\n&gt;No it isn't at all! Let's say you inherited money and you want to build &gt;a factory.\n\nLet's not, because inheritance rights are derivative of initial creation. Inheritance debates come after figuring out whether or not workers keep what they make at the outset.\n\n[Lots of people in society are necessary to build a factory] \n\nYes, many people are needed to build a factory. At every stage we can figure out who is doing what and what they agree to do for wage X. \n\nWhen you use constructions like \"for which society has paid a high cost\" I'd agree with that statement but I don't draw the same meaning. Society doesn't experience or act as an aggregate. So any collection of individual action being social action is tautological; it's uninformative except of the meaning of \"society.\"\n\n\"Everyone built that,\"\n\nFalse. A discrete number of people with expertise in given fields built that. I didn't do dick for that factory, and for me to claim grandly that \"it took a village to do it but we're all proud to have been a part!\" would be pure assholery.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't use it to hoard wealth at the expense of the rest. \n\nThis in particular makes no sense. How does you hoarding what other people paid you for goods or services hurt anyone else? The logic there is tortured to complete arbitrariness. Plus, even as an argument that hoarding wealth is net inefficient, unless that capitalist just hides his wealth in a tin, the bank, his personal investments, and his expenditures puts that capital right back out there doing work.\n\n&gt;Who doesn't use toilet paper ...  everybody utilizes these products.\n\nI am talking about specifics and you are talking about generalizations. I mean forest X gets worked by forestry concern Y and markets to company Z that sells in market M. It's all discrete. It's like you're ignoring the trees for the forest. Yeah there's a forest, but what is it made of? You're generalizing past the point of usefulness. \n\nAnd intrinsic value is a contradiction. That's why I say trees don't have it; so asserting we all \"own\" them is meaningless. Picking a nat'l border as a limit on that ownership over something specific and measurable like who's actually done something on project X is sheer arbitrariness. Trees gain value through human intervention. I assert that's when ownership becomes relevant and should attach to the person imputing value through effort. N.B. This isn't labor theory of value.\n\n&gt;Science has done this, not our economic system. Will science that \n&gt;benefits everyone be funded under LF? Obviously not.\n\nOf course not! Because oil, the internal combustion engine, Microsoft, the telephone, the polio vaccine, well who would think these have benefitted everyone?\n\nIn fact, from our source of record:\n\n\"According to OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industries,\"\n\nSo in the status quo about 70% of R&amp;D is coming from the private sector, as is. I guess they are all marketing to some tiny segment of society that interacts with no one else?\n\n&gt;This is easiest to do under LF - whoever has the most money can \n&gt;invest in the best infrastructure for optimal production and out-\n&gt;compete whoever they can't outright buy. LF means monopolies.\n\nLF means non-coercive monopolies and you're still ignoring that monopolists have to spike out competing tech as well as dominating an industry before they can really become a nuisance. And in the scenario where they start charging a 100 dollars for a toothbrush, what stops someone w/o their awesome infrastructure  from undercutting their windfall profits, just a little bit? And then someone else just a little more? And so on until the reason for gaining the monopoly becomes pointless?\n\nIt's funny to say LF means monopolies when all actual monopolies I know, true monopolies where no one else competes, are all state impositions. Short of law, there's no way to gain a complete monopoly. And you gain a big market share is by offering superior product at superior prices with superior services. If someone corners a market that way, well why would I care except to be happy? When their awesomeness slipped, so would their market control.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367802817", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're right, the 70 million is exactly what you highlighted in that comment. But you're forgetting that that was sold in November. The 68.3 million I was referring to  I was referring to was how many they sold, life to date, in through the fiscal year 2012. Sony made the announcement of 70 million sold in November, and last I checked, 70 &gt; 68.3. Unless you think 1.7 million 360s were sold in a month (October to November, end of the fiscal year to when Sony made the announcement) when it didn't even do that in much in December (i.e. holiday shopping season) in the US which is supposed to be the supreme indicator of worldwide sales, according to you, at least.\n\nSo they didn't need to close the gap in 3 months. It was already closed and then expanded upon in Sony's favor. And you're giving the US too much credit. Yes, alone it makes up a huge chunk of video game sales. Let's even say 45% of total sales (I made that figure up, I know. But the US doesn't take up 50% or higher of total market sales, so the point will stand). But Europe + Asia make up the other 55%, and in those areas, the PS3 outsells the 360. *That's* how the PS3 has outsold the 360, from the PS3s release until now. \n\nAnd the only reason I was referring to the 68.3 and not the 75.9 is because that's all the *official* data we have (since you don't trust the IDC report) from comparable times, when talking about sales figures (i.e. November 2012) since Sony hasn't released their fiscal reports yet. [And with the PS3 selling more than the 360 in Europe and Asia](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/374733/ps3-leads-european-home-console-sales-in-2012-3ds-well-ahead-of-vita-worldwide) and those totals being greater than the US, you should also \"get the idea\" of how the PS3 has sold more consoles.\n\nedit: [and the PS3 leads all consoles in Australia too](http://au.playstation.com/ps3/news/articles/detail/item582244/PS3-dominates-2012-sales-in-Australia/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368035715", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The last time I had someone ask me to use as many parts as possible from their old HP, we only wound up keeping a fan. They wanted very badly to at least keep the case, but most HP cases have very minor things that make them completely incompatible with standard motherboards. As for the wifi adapter, [according to HP](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c01612549#N442), it can plug into a USB header on the motherboard. As long as you can find a way to mount it into the case it should work. \n\nYou say you have a Windows license being used on your M15X. It *might* work, but I wouldn't rely on it. Especially if that license was shipped with the laptop. And if you do sell the laptop, whoever you sell it to is probably going to want an operating system. \n\nAs for Haswell, it's simply Intel's 4th Generation of processor coming out. They will be out for desktops. \n\nBefore you read my list of recommended parts, I want people to know this is my first time recommending parts to someone. While I do work for a local system builder in my town and have built many computers, I don't usually have any say in the parts themselves. The managers always talk to the customers and choose the parts, and I just build it. So if anyone disagrees with any of my chosen parts, feel free to step in. \n\n[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WGqx) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WGqx/by_merchant/) / [Benchmarks](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WGqx/benchmarks/)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [Intel Core i3-3220 3.3GHz Dual-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i33220) | $119.99 @ Amazon \n**Motherboard** | [ASRock B75 PRO3-M Micro ATX  LGA1155 Motherboard](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-b75pro3m) | $76.98 @ SuperBiiz \n**Memory** | [PNY Optima 4GB (1 x 4GB) DDR3-1333 Memory](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/pny-memory-md4096sd31333) | $29.98 @ Outlet PC \n**Video Card** | [MSI Radeon HD 7770 1GB Video Card](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7770pe1gd5oc) | $149.99 @ Mac Mall \n**Case** | [Cooler Master Elite 430 ATX Mid Tower Case](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-case-rc430kwn1) | $29.99 @ Newegg \n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (OEM) (32-bit)](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-os-gfc02021) | $84.99 @ NCIX US \n | | **Total**\n | Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available. | $491.92\n | Generated by PCPartPicker 2013-05-12 01:04 EDT-0400 |\n\n* I know you said you wanted a CPU you could overclock, unfortunately it's a bit hard on this budget. If you decide that's a problem, I can come back to it. \n* This motherboard I chose should fit your exact needs. It has SATA 3 ports for your SSD, three USB 2.0 headers (so you should have at least one extra one for your WiFi adapter), an LGA1155 processor socket (so you can upgrade to almost any current-gen Intel processor), and it even has dual PCI-Express 3.0 slots so you can add a second graphics card and play around with SLI or Crossfire if you desire. You say you want to make sure you can upgrade, this board should have no problem with that. \n* I chose only 1 stick of 4GB RAM so you have room to upgrade later. Typically you want to go with at least two sticks to take advantage of multiple channels, but in your case I think it's better to leave room for upgrades. 4GB should be fine, but I recommend you throw in another 4GB stick as soon as you decide you can afford it. \n* This video card was the best I could find within budget. Typically I'm an NVidia guy, but according to [some Battlefield 3 benchmarks I found](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-6.html), this AMD will perform slightly better for the same price as a GTX 550. \n* For the case I chose an inexpensive Cooler Master, which is a brand I like. [It looks cool too](http://www.coolermaster.com/product/Detail/case/mid-tower/elite-430-black.html). \n* And finally, there's the operating system. If you are able to find a Windows license you're sure will work, we can get you a better CPU, GPU, and perhaps some more RAM. \n\nNow here are the parts from your HP that I'm hoping you can use. If not, we'll have to make some other arrangements. \n\n* **Power Supply** - According to the HP website, your computer should have a 300W power supply. That will probably be fine so long as HP didn't add any weird attachments or make it a weird shape. Though keep in mind if you add more hard drives you might have to change it, and if you add a second video card you will definitely have to change it. \n* **Optical Drive** - According to the HP website, your computer should have a SATA optical drive, which is definitely compatible with this motherboard. \n\nSo let me know what you think, I'm happy to help! :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368336235", "subreddit": "buildapcforme", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Go Buckeyes!\n\nNow...this could take a long time haha. I'm a Columbus native and I desperately miss my home town. It's a wonderful place. \n\nLiving: I believe it was already mentioned, but you're going to want to go south or north of campus. Thankfully that's really easy for a bus commuter. The #2 runs the length of High St through the city and will land you right at campus from either side. I've lived in both and which one is better really depends on what you like. \n\nThe Short North/Victorian Village/Italian Village is interesting, but VV is very very expensive and SN/IV are very hit or miss. Make sure you're towards the southern end of it to avoid the slightly seedier areas. By the way, yes, the Short North is SOUTH of campus. Some of the major benefits to the area are a lot of great bars, shops, galleries, and restaurants including my eternal favorite [The North Market](http://www.northmarket.com/). It also puts you in close proximity with [Wheeler Dog Park](http://parks.columbus.gov/Facility.aspx?id=28590) and [Goodale Park](http://goodalepark.org/) which is home to a few of the areas most well known events, [Pride](http://www.columbuspride.org/) and [Commfest](http://www.comfest.com/index.php). The Short North also has the advantage of putting you closer to downtown and in close range to various concert halls like [LC Pavilion](http://www.promowestlive.com/) and [Nationwide Arena](http://www.nationwidearena.com/). Being on this end also puts you closer to areas like [The Brewery District](http://www.columbusunderground.com/brewery-district-photo-tour) and [German Village](http://germanvillage.com/) which includes local favorites [Schmidt's Sausage House](http://www.schmidthaus.com/) and [The Book Loft](http://www.bookloft.com/)\n\nNow, for the downsides. This area is more expensive, you won't have much by way of a yard, it's more crowded, and the few blocks between where OSU ends and the Short North begins were not especially safe. Not a big deal on a bus, but if you have to walk through it, it's best to keep it in mind. \n\nNow, Clintonville is actually where I was born and raised. It's quite a bit more residential than the southern areas. If you want to be sure you're going to have quiet neighbors, tree lined streets, and a bit more bang for your buck, go with clintonville. Like the Short North you need to get a bit farther from campus to be in the nicer part of it, but that's still negated by the #2 bus. It definitely has a few great food spots including my favorite ever pizza, [Dante's](http://www.dantespizzainc.com/), a gorgeous little bakery called [Mozart's](http://mozartscafe.com/), and many others. For your dog needs there's also a [Pet People](http://www.petpeoplestores.com/) right next to one of the main grocery stores and the gigantic and gorgeous [Whetstone Park](http://parks.columbus.gov/Facility.aspx?id=25948). Whetstone is truly enormous and offers everything from athletic fields, a library, the park of roses, picnic areas, wildlife trails, a community center, and a lot more. They do a huge and very enjoyable fireworks display for the 4th. North of Clintonville you get into Worthington which is a beautiful area. I used to live behind the Graceland Shopping Center and I would do my weekend runs up to Worthington and then stop for breakfast with my family at [La Chatelaine](http://lachatelainebakery.com/), a lovely little french restaurant in an area known as Old Worthington. This area also features summer arts festivals, farmers markets, beautiful little parks, and it's own little shops and restaurants. Worthington also has its own [Dog Park](http://www.worthington.org/Facilities.aspx?Page=detail&amp;RID=3), although it's a bit farther off High St. However, between Whetstone, having a better chance of your own yard, and just a lot of great areas to go for a walk I wouldn't worry about it. \n\nDownsides to Clintonville are that if you want a bit more night life without a car, you're going to have a bit more of a hike. The #2 bus does connect everything and as a student you'll be able to ride for free, but it can still take a bit of time. Getting closer to Worthington is even farther. I don't know if you won't have a car or just don't want to drive to campus, but without a car Clintonville is going to be a little bit rougher. \n\nEvents and Activities: I could go on and on and on about amazing events in Columbus. You will be hard pressed to not be able to find something to do. From monthly events like [the Short North Gallery Hop](http://www.shortnorth.org/popular-links/gallery-hop) to the [Jazz &amp; Ribs Festival](http://www.hotribscooljazz.org/) to concerts and art festivals on [the Riverfront](http://www.sciotomile.com/). There's the gorgeous [Art Museum](http://www.columbusmuseum.org/), the fun for all ages [science center](http://www.cosi.org/), the Historical Society's [Ohio Village](http://www.ohiohistory.org/programs--events/ohio-village), a range of concert halls (including the [Newport](http://www.promowestlive.com/concerts.php?location=Newport+Music+Hall) which is right on campus). Sporting events range from, of course, the beloved Buckeyes to [The Columbus Clippers](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t445) (currently the triple A team to the Cleveland Indians), [Blue Jackets Hockey](http://bluejackets.nhl.com/) and [The Crew](http://www.thecrew.com/) for soccer. If you like rock music, don't ever miss [Rock on the Range](http://www.rockontherange.com/), a massive weekend long rock concert held every year in the crew stadium. There's so many more things I could add to this list and if you narrow down a few categories for me I gladly will, but one of the can't miss aspects of Columbus is [The Columbus Zoo](http://www.columbuszoo.org/). The zoo itself is an amazing way to spend the day and throwing in the attached water park and wildlife preserve, it's just an amazing place. \nAlso last, but not least, campus itself will have quite a few events of its own. Keep an eye on the [Wexner Center](http://wexarts.org/) for artistic events and [OUAB](http://ouab.osu.edu/) for campus sponsored events like free concerts (I saw Chris Rock and 311 during my time at OSU and last year I believe one featured O.A.R). \n\nOSU: A few things are probably givens, but I will say them anyway. OSU is BIG. Learn your way around early. You actually have a slight advantage moving in July. You're going to beat the housing rush. For on campus food options keep track of [The Saver](http://thesaver.com/) it can be snagged almost anywhere on campus and obviously online. Buckeye Donuts is a bit of a staple for late night coffee and sweets during study sessions. There's a small shopping center at the north end of campus called [Gateway](http://www.southcampusgateway.com/) which includes the official [Barnes and Noble college bookstore](http://ohiostate.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/BNCBHomePage?storeId=33552&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;langId=-1), as well as a few restaurants, bars, and a movie theater. My two favorite spots there include [Ugly Tuna](http://www.uglytunasaloona.com/) a slightly ridiculous, but fun bar and [Coldstone Creamery](http://www2.coldstonecreamery.com/) (although if you're an ice cream connoisseur do not pass up [Jeni's](http://www.jenis.com/).) If you do use the bus to commute and you need to be anywhere near campus on a fall Saturday, factor in the football games. I sometimes had to add an hour or two to my work commute when I lived just north of campus and worked just south of it. High St is the border of campus. OSU to the west, a row of shops, restaurants and the newport music hall to the east. Any farther east and you are in frat alley and it is exactly what it sounds like. Before you sign a lease be sure to educate yourself about Bed Bugs. They are a growing problem in the north east of the country and a college town is a great place for them to spread. Know what to check for and use [the bedbug registry](http://www.bedbugregistry.com). Avoid landlords who center around or are headquartered on campus. \n\nAnyway.

They are incredibly comfortable and they really mold to your feet with time. They are relatively light and flexible for a shoe with so much ankle support at a time when many basketball shoes felt like heavy army boots. They have a low profile midsole and outsole with forefoot zoom air pocket that provides good lateral support and cushioning at the same time (translation: low to the ground, but still has good cushioning all over. Normally you have to choose one or the other). They zipped up so no exposed laces to come untied while you are playing.

Texas should first focus on conservation and the reuse of wastewater, said Amy Hardberger, a water specialist with the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nBut then [there are advances in technology too](http://gizmodo.com/5990876/lockheeds-new-carbon-filter-takes-all-the-effort-out-of-desalinization), that promise to desalinate with less energy.\n\nStill, for right now desalinated water costs 3 to 5 times as much as regular freshwater.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370034876", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}
