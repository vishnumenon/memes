Here's some good starter stuff.\n\n* [Almay Eyeliner.](http://www.amazon.com/Almay-Eyeliner-Black-0-01-oz/dp/B001QX7TY0/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370546957&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=almay+eyeliner) This stuff is inexpensive and easy to use if you don't want to spend a lot of money on something you're experimenting with. Plus, Almay has really good deals. I just got a $4 off coupon and used it on a $5 product.\n* [The NYX Nude on Nude palette](http://www.amazon.com/NYX-Palette-Shadows-Colors-Applicator/dp/B004MGAGP2/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547028&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nude+palettes) would be a good starter palette for eyeshadow. Nudes are so versatile and look nice on any skin tone. In a few months I would consider \"upgrading\" to [Urban Decay's Naked 2 Palette](http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Decay-Naked2/dp/B00787QT6W/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547064&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=naked+2). Great pigmentation and lovely shades. I got mine in December and use it every day! I'm only about halfway through it. It's pricey, but spending $50 every 8-10 months on the only palette I need makes it justifiable.\n* Only looking for a few shades? Try [Maybelline's Colour Tattoo](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_lbr_brands_browse-_0?rh=n%3A3760911%2Ck%3Acolor+tattoo%2Cp_lbr_brands_browse-bin%3AMaybelline&amp;keywords=color+tattoo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547177&amp;rnid=2528832011). Stays on literally all day and since it's tacky, it helps your eyeliner stay on, too! Beautiful shades. I have [Barely Branded](http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Studio-Tattoo-Eyeshadow-Branded/dp/B00AQ9KB0O/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547234&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=color+tattoo+barely+branded) and use it on days when I want a \"barely there\" look.\n* I think eyeshadow primers can be tough. I would suggest this [$20 set from Urban Decay](http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Decay-Little-Eyeshadow-Primer/dp/B00433DXOK/ref=sr_1_5?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547437&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=eyeshadow+primer+urban+decaY) because it lets you  mess around with different shades so you can find something you like.\n* [Ecotools brush set](http://www.amazon.com/EcoTools-MINERAL-Make-Brush-Travel/dp/B001EM1BBK/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547265&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ecotools+brush). I don't have it yet but I really want it! I think it's probably all you need for now if you're just getting started.\n* If you're acne prone, try [Neutrogena's skin-clearing foundation](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-SkinClearing-Liquid-Makeup-Natural/dp/B001MS7GYW/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547337&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=neutrogena+make+up). They also have powder and whatnot, what whaaat! I suggest getting it at Walmart or the drugstore though, I believe it's cheaper. It's nice to know that you can layer on the makeup without making your acne worse.\n* For lipstick, I really love [Revlon Lip Butter](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_lbr_brands_browse-_0?rh=n%3A3760911%2Ck%3Arevlon+lip+butter%2Cp_lbr_brands_browse-bin%3ARevlon&amp;keywords=revlon+lip+butter&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547515&amp;rnid=2528832011). I have a few shades. Goes on like a chapstick, stays on like a heavy duty lip colour. And there are so many lovely shades! Plus it's not expensive.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. :)\n\nEDIT: Can't believe I forgot mascara! [Bare Minerals' Flawless Definition mascara](http://www.amazon.com/Bare-Escentuals-bareMinerals-Flawless-Definition/dp/B002IDPHBE/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370547880&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bare+minerals+mascara) is pricier than most drugstore brands but so worth it.

He once saw the pool through the sliding glass door and took off for it only to slam into the pristine just-cleaned glass of the door.. After we stopped crying/laughing, we opened the door and he vaulted in. Epic goof. \n\n&gt;He used to put his back to the wall and his paws on my back and push me out of bed. \n\nJEEZ, this, a thousand times. I had to move my room around so my bed was not up against the wall anymore. Then he would scoot closer and spoon me, which was awesome until he started dreaming.. I'd wake up to claw marks on my cheeks. \n\n[This](http://i.imgur.com/71HWoTQ.jpg) is the most recent picture of him. I happened to be playing CoD2 ( yeah, yeah, I know. ) and between games I glanced over to the \"dog play pen\" which is two [coolaroo](http://www.wag.com/dog/p/cool-a-roo-steel-framed-elevated-pet-bed-292666?site=CA&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_W&amp;utm_term=HYV-13163&amp;utm_campaign=GooglePLA&amp;CAWELAID=1323882097&amp;utm_content=pla&amp;ca_sku=HYV-13163&amp;ca_gpa=pla&amp;ca_kw={keyword}) beds put together with a ridiculous amount of old bedspreads on top, and Tonka had draped his arm around Ramona. I'm not sure if he's being fatherly or trying to rob the cradle. He's neutered, but still.. funny to me. \n\nBig dogs are the best. The best to hug, the best to wrestle with, the best to train.

Each one takes about 6-8 hours, so total he's spent somewhere between 50 and 100 working days playing golf. Which *still* puts him lower than George Bush's first term total. Also of note (see: same source), John Boehner spends 3-4 times the amount of time on the golf course as Obama, but I never see people criticizing his work ethic. \n\nAnd all that aside, it's a pretty common meme I've seen on *all* of these sources I've linked that the President never really takes time off. The job goes where he is, and it's a 24/7 gig. Just look at before/after pictures of our recent presidents, the stress of the job is plainly evident. So even assuming they actually got an entire day off *ever* (in which they do no governing related tasks, at all. Which never happens), Would you really begrudge these men from getting a little bit of \"me\" time?\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371433979", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There is a lot here.  Bear with the wall of text that is going to follow.\n\n&gt;Yup. The Daily Show didn't so much mean to make a parody piece as much as it meant to make a \"serious piece\" of reporting news, passed off as a parody because the people they interviewed were, well, just so gosh darn stupid. Look at these stupid Christians. They're all so stupid! With their stupid believes, being stymied so easily by a fake news reporter, and...\n\nIdeas don't have rights.  If I disagree with your ideas, I will tell you.  Some of the things christians believe are stupid.\n\n&gt;Of course, this is a problem with The Daily Show. They obviously have an agenda, they obviously push the boundaries while claiming it's 'just' satire, and their audience obviously doesn't regard it as 'just' satire. Now on to your questions. I'll be short because they've been answered, re-answered, and re-re-answered just about a thousand times in the sub. The pattern looks something like this.\n&gt;Someone in favor of \"marriage equality\" enters the sub. This someone asks fifteen rhetorical questions, believing their rhetorical questions, red herrings, and appeals to emotion counts for 'logic.' Their questions are answered... sometimes the respondent asks questions of their own.\n&gt;OP ignores respondent's questions, re-hashing their same pattern: They refuse to accept the answers provided them, towing the same lines they walked before, and simply ask more questions, again considering what they've done a \"fine piece of logic.\" Respondent gets tired of answering said questions. OP wins! (in their own mind)\n\n\nI try to expand upon the answer I get.  Often, the answer I get isn't satisfactory, so I try to get the respondent to dig deeper.\n\n\n\n&gt;God decides this. Our actions condemn us. God has given us a moral law. If we break it, we separate ourselves from God. God is perfectly just. His justice extends to His judgment. He has told us homosexuality is a grave moral evil.\n&gt;...if you want to ignore the moral law God has given us, well, He has given you free will. You're free to choose to do so at risk of your own salvation.\n&gt;Just accept it and move on. If you don't like that Christians believe in a natural moral law - well, that's just too bad. I'm sure many criminals disagree with the moral laws atheists feel are just fine to legislate, like prohibitions on murder, theft, and various other illicit activities.\n\n\nSo why not leave it there?  Why must you interfere with their lives on earth.  If you are really right, and they are really wrong you will have an eternity to say I told you so.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Homosexuals cannot get married. Marriage is a covenental relationship sealed before God.\n\nThey are not asking for this type of marriage.  They are asking for CIVIL marriage where they will be afforded all the rights and privileges that heterosexual marriages currently enjoy.\n\n\n&gt;If you're asking whether or not homosexuals deserve the 'right' to be legally contractually obligated to one another, or to simply live together in perpetuity until death do they part, then the State or they as individuals already had options for regulating that.\n\nNo they do not.  They do not receive the same rights and benefits that heterosexual married couple do.  If I am incorrect, please enlighten me.\n\n\n&gt;If you're asking whether or not Christians are ever going to consider homosexuals truly 'married,' well, some 'Christians' have already been performing ceremonies for homosexuals for many years. The Catholic Church will never do so. It will never capitulate to regulating sinful behavior for the sake of social acceptance; that is contrary to it's purpose entirely, which is the salvation of souls... even at the cost of hurt feelings. Further, tt doesn't have the power to marry two homosexual people, just as it doesn't have the power to re-marry or separate two validly married heterosexual people.\n\nNobody is asking for the church to be forced to marry anyone.  Currently the church doesn't have to marry non-catholics.  This would be a similar situation\n\n\n&gt;You don't have to agree. Hate us for our beliefs, though, and you're guilty of the same hypocrisy you charge us with.\n\nI don't hate you for your beliefs, I hate the beliefs and think you are dumb for having them.  That said, I don't think you deserve any type of punishment... just ridicule.\n\n\n\n&gt;The way they're presented is very fringe. \n\nHow so?  What did he say that is inconsistent with your beliefs?\n\n\n\n&gt;Ever been to one? \n\nI see a big difference between mocking and trying to legislate against.  I don't think anyone has the right not to have their feelings hurt.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;We had a user from /r/ainbow come to the sub in response to a historian killing themselves at Notre Dame Cathedral. The man wasn't a Christian, but the sentiment on display was certainly aimed toward Christians. We left the post up for quite some time as it was a fine demonstration of tolerance on display. It read:\n&gt;\"I pray there exists in a hell in which he burns in for spending his life as a terrorist and a contributor of misery to millions of gay people.\"\n&gt;The sentiment was echoed by an apparently not-insignificant minority on /r/ainbow, and I've certainly heard Christians regarded as 'terrorists' before... though of course they are, so it's okay.\n\n\n\nThat's unfortunate.  I wonder if that sentiment would exists if they weren't being told by religion that hell is what is waiting for them... that they are abominations.  The fact that it feels bad when it happens to you should give you some empathy into what they have to deal with much more frequently.\n\n\n&gt;The redefinition of marriage. \n\n\nMarriage predates religion:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#History_of_marriage \n\nhttp://rationalreasons.blogspot.com/2005/05/brief-history-of-marriage.html \n\n\n\nAnd marriage has already been redefined:\n\nhttp://prospect.org/article/marriage-already-redefined \n\n\n\nFurthermore, NO ONE is asking to force you to do a religious marriage,  just a CIVIL one... so they can receive the same rights and benefits that heterosexual couples have.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Equality for those that agree.\n\nWhat equality do you lose in this situation?\n\n&gt;The rest of us can only disagree or practice our faith in private, lest we offend someone and become the target of several lawsuits. This is obviously what the framers intended with the First Amendment.\n\nThe framers approved of slavery.  We live in a growing society, and the constitution is a living document.  \n\nHowever, since you brought up the constitution, I would like to point out that when we look at the [1st amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Amendment#Establishment_of_religion ) and the [14th amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Equal_Protection_Clause ) together, they lean towards agreeing with me.  Of course, in a few weeks we will see which of us the Supreme Court agrees with.\n\n\n\n&gt;Yeaaap, no. Comparing the violent persecution of Christians worldwide to what mostly amounts to instances of the Hurt Feelings Police needing to be called here in America is an outlandish statement. Are there homosexuals that face legitimate discrimination, sometimes hostility escalating to violence? Yes. Are they extreme outliers in what is otherwise an incredibly tolerant society? Yes. \n\n\n[Except christians are violent too] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Anti-Homosexuality_Bill ).  This bill was supported by Exodus International (who was supported by Chi-Fil-A.  One of the big reasons that people called for a boycot).\n\n\n&gt;Christianity is most violently persecuted message in the world. The population of Christians in the Middle East, for example, has been reduced by 75% in the Middle East and the 'Arab speaking' world due to the harshness with which Christians are treated. \n\n\nAnd that is wrong.  I don't know what I wrote that would make you think I support Islam more than christianity.  They believe and do shitty things too.\n\n\n\n&gt;Well golly now that you put it like that my mind is changed. \n\nI don't expect to, just explaining where I come from.\n\n\n&gt;Apparently when it's funny, yes, you should hold your tongue. Gosh-darn Christians and their shitty beliefs! Always worth a guffaw. \n\nThere's a difference between persecution and mocking.  I don't have any problem with you mocking gay people.  I don't even care if you say they are hell bound.  I do have a problem when you limit ANYONE'S rights.\n\n\n&gt;When doing so results in greater good than remaining silent. I guess if you (and the target of said intolerance) would be murdered for speaking up, then I'd likely wait on it. However, if you believe the Church is intolerant of homosexuals, you'd be way off. The Church doesn't believe it's proper to reduce anyone to their sexual orientation. She calls homosexuals to live virtuous lives of chastity, just like everyone else. \n\n\nExcept heterosexuals have the option of finding someone they love, and marrying them.  Under your rules, homosexuals do not have the same option.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371848459", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You have failed to answer my question you say that there are no point at which lions do not become lions, but then go on to say that elephants can be as small as ponies. If an elephant can be as small as a pony due to natural selection, then it could have many other attributes. If a \"lion\" population evolved to have longer snouts, horns, and hooves would they be lions? Hell no.\n\n&gt;Scientists were able to literally see the gravitational effect it was having\n\nWhat the hell kind of gravity seeing scientists are you referring to? \n\n&gt;The genetic code keeps it from doing so. Offspring are nearly identical copies of their parents with as I said, the exception of very rare birth defects and benign or detrimental mutations.\n\nThis is the essence of why evolution exists, without mutations, evolution does not exist.\n\n&gt;Oh well bugs don't evolve because they don't need to and there trillions of them\n\nTry spreading a single genetic modification through breeding to EVERY SINGLE one of your species, it takes time, and you will die before it happens.\n\n&gt; but there aren't trillions of alligators but then you say \"oh well maybe they just don't need to evolve\" but that doesn't make sense. \n\nWell as far as I know, the gun is the most efficient way of killing a single person accurately from a range, sure it has had minor improvements over the years, but it still keeps it's basic design, such as with the alligator, it just so happened to be a successful design that needs little improvement for the circumstances it is in. Mutations do not effect entire populations unless they are essential for keeping the population alive. Also, alligators have gotten much smaller than before, and [they have evolved in other ways too](http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/typesofdinosaurs/a/crocodilians.htm) since the little over 200 million period from which they first appeared.\n\n\nAnd since you still do not believe that a population of lions or anything can change into another animal over the course of a BILLION years, I will be forced to direct you to the most simplistic representation of what evolution does. So simple in fact, a child could understand, [The Animorph's cover](http://animorphsforum.com/ebooks/covers/bk37.jpg) This is how it works in the most basic sense, it very slowly makes minor changes, eventually turning into something else. But it does not stop evolving, it keeps adding and slowly removing things to better fit it's needs.

{"body": "I think it's *possible* but not likely.\n\n* First off, there needs to be *one hell* of an actor for Lex if they're going to attempt it. He needs to play the part in a way no one ever has before, be charismatic as all get out, and there needs to be a distinctive look about him. Rosenbaulm, Spacey, &amp; Hackman were all (I'm gonna get hell for this) basically the same. White bald guys who could look creepy and shady as hell under the right circumstances. That's why I like [Arnold Vosloo](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903677/) for the role, he's not white, he's south African, he *is* bald, but he pulls it off in a handsome way rather than creepy, but he *can* be creepy if he wants to, more than anything else, he puts off vibes of aggression, malevolence, something I've personally never felt from a live action Luthor to date. Most importantly (for me, at least), he's got the Luthor voice.\n* Secondly, they would have to make Lexs schemes as multilayered &amp; diabolical as possible, truly brilliant, deserve-a-movie-of-their-very-own type schemes, think.. The Italian Job meets the interwoven &amp; overcomplicated nature of, say, Game of Thrones, or Inception. Plots within plots within plots with multiple redundant contingency plans as well. Joker was Mad, he was unpredictable, that was his, er, *charm?* Lex is methodical, and brilliant, and he's always got a trick up his sleeve. That kind of plot has good sides (excellent depth) and bad (hardly anybodies going to understand it easily).\n* The plots &amp; plans have to *directly* involve putting large swaths of people in danger. Stopping Luthor from killing Superman (self defense) or Lois Lane isn't enough, it needs to be a plot with world wide cataclysmic consequences. Sinking the West Coast isn't enough, flooding low-lying areas isn't enough, I'm thinking, start a nuclear war between the US &amp; China, while he holds a monopoly on the biggest, most well stocked bunkers, subway systems, and underground facilities worldwide, and when the bombs start falling, he rakes in all the power, the wealth, and lives as king under the burnt earth, because if you deny him anything, he'll simply ask you to leave. He must not emote any compunctions or regrets about this idea. How it all will come about is complicated &amp; subtle, but evil, I have ideas, but they're too long to put here.\n* The big thing, and why I saved it for last, is that he must succeed not only at accomplishing a significant portion of his plan for it to feel threatening, but he should do it to thunderous applause, the first stages of his plans and his media interactions must twist &amp; distort things to the point where Superman seems the evil guy for opposing him. There should be debates on television as to whether or not Superman is all he's cracked up to be if he's opposing this innocent and philanthropic businessman in his noble efforts. There should be US Politicians who openly call for the government to take a role directly and explicitly backing Luthor.

The revelation that he was trying to murder Billions of people should come as a complete shock to the world at the end.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372247078", "subreddit": "superman", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
