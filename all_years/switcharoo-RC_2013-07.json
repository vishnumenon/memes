They are non-corrosive, but can be a fire hazard. They also have limited residual activity due to evaporation, which results in brief contact times unless the surface is submerged, and have a limited activity in the presence of organic material. Alcohols are most effective when combined with purified water to facilitate diffusion through the cell membrane; 100% alcohol typically denatures only external membrane proteins. A mixture of 70% ethanol or isopropanol diluted in water is effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria, though higher concentrations are often needed to disinfect wet surfaces.\n\n&gt; Additionally, high-concentration mixtures (such as 80% ethanol + 5% isopropanol) are required to effectively inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses (such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C). High concentrations of alcohol or solvents or combination with other disinfectants can result in drying out much more quickly on the applied surface. Such drying could lead to cyst formation and thus ineffective or incomplete disinfection. Alcohol is, at best, only partly effective against most non-enveloped viruses (such as hepatitis A), and is not effective against fungal and bacterial spores.\n\n&gt; The efficacy of alcohol is enhanced when in solution with the wetting agent dodecanoic acid (coconut soap). The synergistic effect of 29.4% ethanol with dodecanoic acid is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Further testing is being performed against Clostridium difficile (C.Diff) spores with higher concentrations of ethanol and dodecanoic acid, which proved effective with a contact time of ten minutes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373165448", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It feels good, smells good, and I love that it's a bar. I hate that when you look at shampoo and conditioner the first ingredient is water. Why am I paying for your water when I'm going to add my own? This doesn't make sense! I feel like I've taken crazy pills! \n\nI digress. Their [Jungle Conditioner Bar] (http://www.lushusa.com/Jungle/03399,en_US,pd.html?start=5&amp;cgid=conditioners) is a great accompaniment. Oh, and it smells awesome. Unless you don't like the dirty hippy (patchouli-ish) smell, then you probably won't like it.... In that case, go for [BIG] (http://www.lushusa.com/Big-Solid-Conditioner/03738,en_US,pd.html?start=2), it smells more like baby powder and is very volumizing. \n\nThank you for hosting!

{"body": "One of the signal events you should consider is actually legal in nature -- that's the development of the Fifth Amendment at the turn of the twentieth century. \n\nBefore the Depression -- and before FDR, really -- the \"due process\" clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments:\n\n&gt;[N]or shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\n\nwere understood to protect, as a basically fundamental right that cannot be intruded upon, an all-but absolute liberty of contract. As a result, when the legislature proscribed a rule of business, like, for example, minimum wage laws, the law would amount to a violation of the \"due process\" right of the employee and employer to freely contract. From a policy perspective, the argument is, \"if he wants to work for less money, let him!!!\" The case to look at is [Lochner v. New York.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York)\n\nWhen FDR came to power and set out his \"New Deal\" agenda -- including restrictions on the trading of securities (Securities and Exchange Acts), and other programs, obviously the rule in *Lochner* posed a major roadblock. To end the rule, which the Court maintained term after term, FDR went to war with the Justices, threatening to expand the size of the Court so he could add his own, sympathetic jurists. \n\nFDR lost that fight. It was seen as an unprecedented power grab -- but for \"some reason,\" the court repealed the rule in Lochner not long after the threat.  This was the \"Switch in Time that Saved Nine,\" and it's best seen in [*West Coast Hotels v. Parrish*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Hotel_Co._v._Parrish). \n\nQuery why the Court \"switched.\" Were they actually intimidated? Or was there a genuine change of heart? \n\nThis is actually a case of the individuals *gaining* power vis-a-vis the corporations, through a change in a (now) relatively obscure doctrine. I recommend you read the decisions to get an idea of how \"corporatist\" and anti-corporate rhetoric developed in the early 1900s. The Cornell LII site has the opinions, linked from the Wikipedia articles. \n\nThere's also a relatively modern debate about *Lochner*, too. \n\n* Conservative columnist George Will called for a return to *Lochner* in a major [article](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-09-07/opinions/35274849_1_individual-rights-ninth-amendment-bakeries).\n\n* Bloggers on the prominent Volokh Conspiracy [blog](http://www.volokh.com/2011/09/08/liberal-reactions-to-george-wills-lochner-column/) supported him.\n\n* And Akhil Amar, a major constitutional scholar, [weighed in too](http://www.volokh.com/2012/09/12/de-habilitating-lochner-a-response-to-david-bernstein/). \n\nAmar is a major legal thinker these days. Anything you can find by him on the subject, I recommend you read it. Amar is an expert on legal history and has an interest in *Lochner*.\n\n-----\n**Edit** for sourcing.

{"body": "I disagree (obviously), mainly because an advertisement is meant to promote a product's end result, to \"do as advertised\". Now, the average consumer is aware that the pictures are 'shopped, but that doesn't change the fact that billboards are false advertisements. The artist here isn't making any claims (that I'm aware of, at least - if so, feel free to correct me), he's just making his art and doing in a way that is aesthetically pleasing to him (and his viewers, of course). \n\nTake this [CoverGirl ad](http://www.styleite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mascara.png) as an example - the premise of the ad is that using this brand's mascara will help avoid clumpy eyelashes (left page, right side) and instead create beautifully lush, clump-free lashes (left, left). The model not only has her skin photoshopped but is also wearing false eyelashes. The average woman is not going to get this effect from *any* mascara, but the average woman also knows this; what she *is* hoping for, however, is that she will get something very similar to the faked look on the left. This is false advertising and is different because it is selling a specific product, it isn't meant to be art, it's meant to lure in customers.\n\nNow, when you delve into selling aesthetics, I would agree that both a ad agency editor and the artist are selling a certain aesthetic. The major difference, though, is that the editor isn't stopping with the ad - his end goal is to move product, whereas the painter's art *is* the end product.\n\nThese are just my opinions, of course, and I can respect that people have different points of view. I just know that ***I*** feel there is a distinct difference between creating art and misleading the general public, and I would be insulted if someone tried to compare my work to some uncreative, generic, photoshopped stock image with some text slapped onto a piece of wood (yes, [I can use the blur and dodge tools, too](http://media.smashingmagazine.com/images/poster-advertisement-tutorials/50.jpg)).\n\nHave an upvote for discussion ;)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374823804", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Same goes for cyclists.\n\n&gt; As for roads, there are literally dozens of examples but I think heading towards Cap Hill via the Arboretum illustrates the point nicely\n\nThen either take a different route or leave earlier. It's true that E Lake Washington Boulevard is a popular bike route, and after driving on that road once or twice you should know to leave some extra time or to take a different route. There are also plenty of passing zones on that street.
