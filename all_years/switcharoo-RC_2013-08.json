Anyways later that night after our success we decided to have some beers to celebrate. Well we got a good buzz going and someone suggested we start a bon fire with it. It was cold that night so were like yeah fuck it lets do it. Well we poured a gallon of gasoline in the fucking thing (worst idea ever, fuck) so we start trowing matches in there, the fucking was like fire proof it would not light!! So literally my words \"hold my beer, im going in\" i start to try and light it with a lighter and finally a little flame comes on........(yeah you can guess what happened next) it went up like a god damn bomb! I was engulfed by a 12 foot fucking explosion, when suddenly my ninja skills kicked in and did a fucking back flip out the bitch and rolled like muthafucking samus till i hit the house about 7 feet away.

{"body": "I am quite the newbie still, but I did a lot of research and asked a lot of stupid question over the last year, so I think my opinion won't be completely useless :D So here's some bits of advice in no specific order:\n\n* you can use online calculators to get a vague idea of the length and width you need; however, it might be a good idea to get a shorter board while you're still a beginner;\n\n* it's better to get a cheaper model from the last 2-3 years than a more expensive one from 5-6 years ago. Apparently there were some big leaps in manufacture recently;\n\n* the only way to get a feel of a board is to ride it really... Personally I had a lot more fun with a softer board. I didn't progress as much as I wanted because I was stuck with a really stiff one, and once I tried a softer one it felt amazing - even though I don't go to the park at all.  So the one I will buy for this winter will be relatively soft (4-5 out of 10 max) and relatively short for me just because of that, and I will look to replace it with a stiffer one when I progress further;\n\n* in short, you need a softer board for the park, and a stiffer one for slopes, especially if you want more control and speed. However, while a stiffer board provides more control, it is also more demanding. Rocker shape (or some hybrid with rocker) is generally better for powder since the nose stays on top of the snow easier;\n\n* if you got some friend who is travelling from the US, check out evo.com. International shipping is limited to only a few items and is rather expensive though;\n\n* I have only heard great things about the Atlas. The bindings I bought this March costed about £110-120 and were much cheaper than the Atlas at the time - yet they felt great. So I wouldn't think twice before buying them.

To recap:\n-Weekend getaways alone together\n-Her comment that \"we're all in trouble now\" when they were discovered by the horseback couples\n-The 13 calls between the two on the morning of the killings/\"abduction\"\n-The letters from her to him found at the scene\n-The bizarre social media AMA she did just days after being rescued\n\nWhat doesn't add up is the fact that the media has been perfectly fine running with the innocent victim narrative. I guess you cannot blame them as they need to be careful to not look like they are attacking a young girl who may not be guilty of anything. I admit that there is a perfectly benign explanation for all of the points listed above (maybe she just thought she was his friend and he thoroughly manipulated her for his own sick and twisted reasons). However, the media has made a business out of being completely fucking wrong on shit like this. They want a tidy little feel-good story that involves a bad man getting killed and an innocent sweetheart rescued to the world's delight. The scenario where she was actually fucking this guy and may only have crocodile tears to shed for the loss of her inconvenient brother and mother never crosses their minds. Well, if one of those letters to him describes her wish to kill her family so that they may be together that will change in a heartbeat.

{"body": "[Cuttle fish are pretty cool too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish)\n\n&gt;Cuttlefish are sometimes referred to as the \"chameleons of the sea\" because of their remarkable ability to rapidly alter their skin color at will. Cuttlefish change color and pattern (including of light polarisation and even texture) to communicate to other cuttlefish, to camouflage themselves, and in deimatic display to warn off potential predators.\n\n&gt;This color-changing function is produced by groups of red, yellow, brown, and black pigmented chromatophores above a layer of reflective iridophores and leucophores, with up to 200 of these specialized pigment cells per square millimeter,[5] which would correspond to about 359 DPI if they could be individually controlled. The pigmented chromatophores have a sac of pigment and a large membrane that is folded when retracted. The six to 20 small muscle cells on the sides can contract to squash the elastic sac into a disc against the skin. Yellow chromatophores (xanthophores) are closest to the surface of the skin, red and orange are below (erythrophores), and brown or black are just above the iridophore layer (melanophores). The iridophores reflect blue and green light. Iridophores are plates of chitin or protein, which can reflect the environment around a cuttlefish. They are responsible for the metallic blues, greens, golds, and silvers often seen on cuttlefish. All of these cells can be used in combinations. For example, orange is produced by red and yellow chromatophores,[contradiction][dubious ] while purple can be created by a red chromatophore and an iridophore. The cuttlefish can also use an iridophore and a yellow chromatophore to produce a brighter green. As well as being able to influence the color of light as it reflects off their skin, cuttlefish can also affect the light's polarization, which can be used to signal to other marine animals, many of which can also sense polarization.[6]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376705044", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Story time. In 2010, I was applying to an extremely competitive film school. Incredibly, I was selected for an interview. Only 100 applicants make it this far, and only 20 applicants would be accepted total. So, the interview wound up lasting only ten minutes, but afterward they put six applicants in a room together, to watch a clip from a film on repeat, and write as much as they could about it. Everyone else was rushing to prove how much knowledge they had, filling up  pages and pages of facts and figures, so I tried my best, but only wrote about two. The largest section, however, was \"Write how you would have the next scene play out.\" \n\nI was stumped, so I just tried to watch and analyse the clip further. The scene had one moment that was hilariously campy, but didn't seem to know it. After about the twentieth time the clip had played, I burst out laughing. Another applicant did the same. As other applicants finished and left the room, we started joking with each other about how hilariously bad the film probably was. \"Why the fuck are there funeral bells!?\" He said. We both laughed.\n\n Eventually we both started spit-balling ideas for what the next scene would be, making the ideas more and more camp. It was really fun. When we were done, we wrote down our stories. I got accepted. Two years later, I catch my room mate / best friend at college telling the same story, from the other side. We both became best friends in our film class, without even realizing we were the ones who helped get each other into the program in the first place.\n\n Oh, and he's this redditor: [/u/baibybloo] (http://www.reddit.com/user/baibybloo)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376948539", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 60, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The point is that not every woman can have the apex male, especially in a enforced monogamous society. So she will \"settle\" for a provider, but will offer herself to the apex male on the sly if the opportunity arises (and possibly bear his \"superior\" child). Of course it's a bit more complex than that in a society numbering in millions, where you have an apex class instead of a single apex male, but the basic motivation is there.\n\n&gt; The blanket statement that women are hypergamous biologically is ignorant and offensive.\n\nOh, is it? I'm sure it's not what you'd like to believe about women. But here are a few articles for you to look at:\n\n[Ovulating women favour dominant men's smell](http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050704/full/news050704-6.html)\n\n[In China, women are nakedly hypergamous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/07/chinas-marriage-market)\nWell, at least they're honest, unlike here.\n\n[It happens all over in biology, too](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/birds-mate-life-cheat/story?id=18949572)\n\n&gt; Hypergamous people are extremely immature and inconsiderate.\n\nFunny how that works. This is precisely when she's young, isn't it. Then when she reaches her thirties (typically) she realizes no prince is going to sweep her away, and that in fact the princes she's been sleeping around with (serial monogamy) are a bunch of cads. Finally then she'll start looking at the steady beta male. Sadly, she's already given away the best years of her life to the cads, hasn't she, while he's simply had to do without. And she may have a child or two in tow as well.\n\nBy the way, are you sure you're not confusing hypergamy with polygamy?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377128988", "subreddit": "MensRights", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. Not everybody's hair is the same. If you're worried about sleepovers, etc, you could pack a small piece of Llush's Solid Shampoo](https://www.lush.co.uk/product/301/New-Solid-Shampoo-Bar) in your makeup bag, and quickly wash it under the tap. I do this sometimes while camping. \n\n2. Try an epilator. It lasts longer, and since the hairs are pulled, not cut they feel less prickly when they come back. If you have a beard or hair in other typically masculine places I would suggest seeing your GP to check your hormones are in balance.\n\n3. You can't shrink your pores. Keeping them clean will help them be less visible, but pore shrinking products are a waste of money. \n\n4. You could consider using a mascara if there are hairs there that are just not visible, or getting semi permanent make up.\n\nReally you need to relax. Nobody is perfect, and those girls you envy envy something you have.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377778764", "subreddit": "TheGirlSurvivalGuide", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
