If you want to go down a rabbit hole, research RH negative blood, and reptilians. I also know someone with mind powers, RH negative blood, and a scale-like skin condition that I believe is the closes thing to reptilian-humanoid. No, I don't mean actual half human/half reptile hybrid. I mean, reptilian as in a descendant of the Draconians.

The first half of this episode (well, I guess the first two-thirds) were kind of extremely silly, but KyoAni whipped out that signature control of a quiet moment (on display in Disappearance, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, and even Clannad) for the last act, and stuck the landing. They centered the episode on Rei but managed to fit in some of the best moments for both Haru and Rin.

{"body": "&gt;They don't have the right to punish me for this do they? I almost got suspended for this.\n\nSo to clarify, *you* did not get punished?\n\nYou asked for court cases. Here you go. In general, high school students do not always have the rights that someone else would. It's a strange hybrid world, because (at *public* high schools) it is an arm of the government. There is a lot of [case law](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/searches.htm) involving high schools and the 4th Amendment.\n\nThe 1st Amendment as it pertains to high school has [case law too](http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/legalresearch.asp?id=3) but in the area of social media, this is pretty new. You might find [this article](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130815/15270224193/ca-high-school-students-kill-first-amendment-violating-social-media-contract.shtml) interesting, but do NOT take the title's claim for granted. No court ruled that Lodi's policy was a violation of the Constitution.\n\nWas the acquisition of the photo (as you describe it) a violation of the 4th Amendment? Probably not, though in another context it might have been. Was punishment a violation of the 1st Amendment? Probably not as well. Students have *stronger* protection when something is in a *public* forum or publication for students. In this case the individual didn't intend for this to be a public protest; ironically, he might have had more protection if he did (unlikely, but in theory he might've).\n\nReading the rest of your post, I'd like to make a suggestion. Whether through lack of foresight or through malice, the ASB policy seems to be harmful. Instead of posting silly angry (and perhaps offensive) pictures, get organized and *do* something about it. Use the avenues available to you. You may already be doing this; if so, great. Approach it professionally, in a sober and focused fashion, and try to determine the reason for the ASB policy -- did they WANT to shut down smaller clubs, or just increase sporting event attendance? Wear something general (textless, no \"ASB sucks\" buttons) to signify, quietly, disapproval of the policy, so long as it doesn't violate the dress code. Get on the local news (not about the Hitler picture, about the ASB policy). *Go to a school board meeting.* If you're a legal adult, run for the school board. Even if you lose, your campaign will be about this one issue and will probably get media attention. \n\nIf the school tries to punish you for *this* sort of thing, so long as you behave in a mature manner (even if others don't) the ACLU will be beating down your door to help. Good luck.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380438350", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
