{"body": "Corki did get really lucky with the Valkyrie and Missile buffs, but I still maintain that if Trinity didn't exist, Corki wouldn't be played. He has a meager range of 550 without solid pre-6 damage and/or safe farming. Graves does full burst better and Ezreal does full poke better without Trinity on him for two examples. Funnily enough, they were the other 2 of the S2 Holy Trinity.\n\nI want to bring into light something I caught Xypherous saying a few months back; he wants items to be built to be geared towards a specific niche every time you buy them, rather than a 'one-size fits all' item. He is responsible for the item overhaul, so he definitely has something worthwhile to say. Look around for his posts if you have the chance - definitely one of the most informed Rioters and one of the best at explaining his intentions and reasoning.\n\nI don't think that the support role will ever disappear entirely. As in both DotA and LoL, you need at least one person to secede farm to the rest of the team. \n\nIn DotA, they are a lot more free about their positions [tri lanes, 2x duo lanes, etc.] but they still run by 1-5, whereby 1 gets most farm to 5, who gets no farm + all support items/wards. LoL runs in a similar fashion where \"1 and 2\" are interchangable with AP and AD carry [for the most part], 3 is the top laner, 4, jungle, and 5, support. \n\nVery loose configurations just to explain the whole idea, but you need people at the bottom of the totem pole in order to streamline all of your gold into 1-2 people who are going to be super relevant. In this case, AD carry and mid lane get all the farm to build nothing but damage, 3 &amp; 4 get tanky to mitigate the damage, and 5 holds down the fort with CC and vision control [though some would argue jungle takes up a portion of said vision control too]. \n\nThe same hierarchy is formed in order to make sure that you can maximize your team's potential. The S4 gold flow changes might frontload more into ambient gold again or something, but that would make it more like 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 3.5 with jungle and support still getting the short straw because they don't get solo lane farm nor experience. \n\nUnless they balanced it like Strife [the MOBA being made by the creators of HoN], where every last hit gives your entire team a bit of gold and anyone in the vicinity half the reward from the item, gold will never flow evenly as Riot hopes it would. Another thing Strife does right in this venture is by making wards a part of every character's kit - 1 min duration, 3 min CD or something like that. You can only have max 5 wards on the map per side and they don't cover all avenues, meaning there are always gank paths for junglers.\n\nMy last bit about the gold flow changes is this; I play a lot of jungle and support, and I don't think these two roles need gold to feel relevant. It's part of their appeal that we can min-max our gold so well and be so relevant regardless of having 3-5k less than the Shen jumping on my carry. Likewise, Riot has spent so much of the past year and a half balancing supports under the intention that they aren't very useful in solo lanes because of the sheer utility they offer. Giving them the option to buy real items feels like a fallacy more than anything else. I mean, in solo queue, I've seen supports with Shurelya's/Locket/Twin Shadows/etc., but it's only because they don't want to spend 80% of their income on wards - something that is a commonly held belief outside of competitive 5v5 - and you're not going to draw the competitive 5v5 out of it until you make a serious change to how wards work in this game.\n\nI think what pros are looking forward to [like us] is how long they can display something is broken until they change it. i.e. Cleaver stacking. They make a living on finding what is strong and what isn't. It's what they do; at that point, it's 'just another thing on the list'. They're probably happy enough it only happens once a year.\n\nAs per the edit, there is no such thing as perfect balance in a MOBA. Things will always be innately stronger than others, and it's just about how the game shifts in order to account for that. It's just like how no one in the right mind would say all 118 champions [or however many are released] are competitively viable.\n\nThe real question all comes down to how the meta game evolves to accommodate the new blood [both players and champions] and how they react what is set in stone.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381122011", "subreddit": "summoners", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The site of the Louvre may have once been occupied by a wooden fortress during the time of the [Frankish Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia). However, the Louvre itself was not built until the 12th century. \n\nDuring the forty-three-year reign of [Philippe Auguste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France) (1180–1223), the power and influence of the French monarchy grew considerably, both inside and outside the kingdom. In 1190, a rampart was built around Paris, which was Europe’s biggest city at the time. To protect the capital, the king decided to reinforce its defenses with a powerful fortress, which came to be known as the Louvre.\n\n\nIn the mid-14th century, Paris spread far beyond Philippe Auguste’s original wall. With the onset of the [Hundred Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War), further defenses were needed for the French capital. Enclosed within the expanding city, the Louvre lost its defensive function.\n\nNo longer needed as a fortress, by the end of the 16th century, the Louvre had been transformed into a Renaissance Palace. However, in 1682, [Louis XIV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV) chose the [Palace of Versailles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles) for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection.\n\nDuring the [French Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), the [National Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Constituent_Assembly) decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces. The original collections of the Louvre were increased under [Napoléon Bonaparte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France) and the museum renamed the Musée Napoléon. After the defeat of Napoléon at [Waterloo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo), many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners.\n\nSince the [Third Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic), the collections of the Louvre have grown steadily through donations and gifts. It is now one of the world's largest and most important museums.\n\n-- [Reconstruction Of The Louvre As A Possible Wooden Fortress During The Frankish Kingdom in the 6th and 7th Centuries](http://i.imgur.com/1DPU5Wx.jpg)\n\n-- [Reconstruction Of The Louvre As A Defunct Renaissance Palace](http://i.imgur.com/rXTgxhX.jpg)\n\n-- [The Louvre Today](http://i.imgur.com/t6AUZdd.jpg)\n\n-- [Location](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.861228,2.335024&amp;spn=0.005153,0.013078&amp;t=k&amp;z=17)\n\nSources of photos: [1](http://www.clg-vigny-courbevoie.ac-versailles.fr/entree/college/Histoire/site%205F/CHRISTOPHER.html), [2](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Reconstruction-of-the-Louvre-During-the-Period-of-the-Frankish-Kingdom-in-the-6th-and-7th-Centuries-Posters_i9048090_.htm), [3](http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Paris_moderne._Les_Tuileries,_le_Louvre,_et_la_rue_de_Rivoli,_vue_prise_du_Jardin_des_Tuileries.jpg), [4](http://www.1tong.com/bizhi/2661-298-5-1920x1200.html)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381683355", "subreddit": "castles", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

Hair is always based on base colour with tone added, though, so even if you got to that lightness right now, there's a chance that your hair would stay yellow, and for that you would need a really good ashy, light toner (at my salon we use Wella Koleston 12/11 which is the lightest blonde possible with loads of ash tone in, always gets a nice effect on our customers).\n\nI'd recommend not trying to highlight your own hair as getting a really effective result is hard enough as a stylist without adding in the difficulty of doing it for yourself. I'd make another salon trip (to another salon if you're unhappy about going to the same place again) and explain your situation. In the meantime, get yourself some [violet shampoo](https://www.google.co.uk/#q=violet+shampoo&amp;tbm=shop) to help tone down the yellowishness that you have right now (use it as often as you like to achieve your desired level of ash, but be wary of using it too much or your hair will start turning purple!) - the only one I have any experience of using is [Joico Colour Endure Violet](http://www.bathandunwind.com/joico/joico-color-endure-violet-shampoo.htm) because we use it in our salon - it's also sulfate free if you're looking for that.\n\nI hope some of this has been helpful for you :) Let me know if you have any questions or anything :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382041744", "subreddit": "FancyFollicles", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
