There's no intersections, it's just a reserve on either side, never see any people off the side of the road... yet it has the same speed limit as the far more complicated bit of driving at the opposite, beach side, end of Whitfords Ave. Or next to the shopping complex.\n\nClearly, that's suboptimal. If we didn't have one speed limit per road (a general rule to keep speed limits simple), the reserve end ought be at least 80 (like the comparable stretch on Ocean Reef Road on the other side of the road is), and the shopping complex end should be no more than 60 (like Stirling Highway). Instead, we choose an average figure, suboptimal in both circumstances, and people in general just go a bit slower past the shopping centre because, get this, the majority of people do actually drive to conditions (see the [85th percentile rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit#Maximum_speed_limits) used commonly for setting speed limits around the world).\n\nClearly we do need speed limits for that 15% that'd otherwise drive recklessly, but I think it's silly to argue that they are at all times ideal for all conditions and all parts of the road. They're not, they're just an approximation of what would be a reasonable average maximum speed down the entire stretch of road in normal conditions. In parts and under some conditions you should drive a bit slower, and most likely naturally will, and in parts it'd be perfectly reasonable to go a bit faster, as traffic naturally tends to do which is why for a long time there was a semi-permanent speed camera in the aforementioned part of Whitfords Ave.\n\nNB: As I said, I don't speed, but I used to do drive to Wangara regularly so that particular stretch comes to mind. Always used to spot the same speed camera there, flashing away at people driving to the conditions. If it weren't, I would have done 80 like the rest of them.

{"body": "I don't like this petition, but it isn't against free speech. Like OP said, it won't do any good. The reason petitions like this work on corporations and businesses is because they stand to lose profit if they have a bad reputation. RoK doesn't give a damn about it's bad reputation, in fact it thrives off of it. All it cares about is web traffic, and every time someone goes from the petition to the article on RoK, RoK gets what it wants. It stands only to gain from this petition.\n\nThis points to why it's not against freedom of speech pretty clearly. I'm assuming we're taking a much wider approach to freedom of speech than the law does, because this clearly isn't legal action. In any case, RoK still has the freedom of choice. A petition does not and cannot force RoK to take down that article. It is merely a bunch of people saying \"we think this article sucks\". And guess what? They have freedom of speech too, so they get to do that.\n\nThe real question is, if TRP is so concerned with censorship, so bothered when people can't say whatever they want without having it removed **why are they one of the most ban happy subs on reddit?**\n\nAlso, now seems as good a time as any to [show off my cool tattoo](http://imgur.com/6rsRoVI)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384880687", "subreddit": "TheBluePill", "score": 62, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thank you so much for your extremely considered reply. Will do my best to discuss all the points!\n\nFirst, nation states are the conclusion of socioeconomic theory and shouldn't be discounted too quickly. Abstract ideas are given simplistic slogans to rally support and make not-always-majority decisions on *behalf* of people i.e. Iraq/Afghanistan. Interestingly, you used the same medieval torture device that came to mind when replying before. The culture of violence has reduced (see replies to other comments below), I agree with this fact. The use of violence, even among the supposed 'most civilised' societies remains. The severity etc. may be different, more targeted.. but it is still there.. and 100,000 civilians still died in Iraq. When you talk of a \"dirty bomb\" do you mean a fission one (highly effective and devastating) or one that 'just' spread radioactivity.. [which is far less harmful/destructive](http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/06/53110).\n\n&gt;*Not anymore. We live in the age of bayesian statistics.*\n\nWe are quite far from candidate DNA being provided in elections don't you think? Plus... DNA/brain structure aren't always good indicators of psychopathy such as [the neuroscientist who accidentally discovered he was a psychopath](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/11/the-neuroscientist-who-discovered-he-was-a-psychopath/). Also an [interesting TED talk here](http://www.ted.com/talks/jim_fallon_exploring_the_mind_of_a_killer.html). The fact remains that, for the immediate future the possibility of such candidates remain. Plus, look at the current generation of politicians; they all seem to follow a similar mould (here in the UK they nearly always study PPE).\n\n&gt;*You don't really believe that, do you? If so, please tell me a story about the last time you used violence to solve a problem in thine own life.*\n\nI meant *ultimately* as ultimate. We have many methods of solving problems and violence is not always physical, it can be emotional too. Ever guilt tripped someone into doing what you want.. what about leaders using fear to sell their vested interests.. is this a form of emotional violence? Perhaps that needs more discussion. Typically one solves problems by talking.. if that fails we use the court system. If you remove 'normal' controls and let a market self regulate you see violence as one of the primary means of control - for reference look at the world illicit drug market. [Here is a brilliant talk on cartels using violence too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYU25aJpg5o&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player). All that separates 'drug markets' from licit drug markets (such as Alcohol and Tobacco) is dispute resolution. You can't take to court/sue and brand/patent/tradmark in the normal way. Thousands, if not millions, of people all over the world use violence, or the threat of violence to solve disputes - [just look at how the threat of violence here is used for something as arbitrary as cutting into traffic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhJ20Z4eB28). Perhaps 'threat of violence' would have been a better phrase to use.. but the point still stands that when all else fails, our species turns to violence, either on the individual level or the state level. Not always, granted, but in far more cases than one would like to admit when trying to say that our species can climb out of its metaphorical adolescence. I somewhat envy your belief that we can progress without at least some fundamental changes :).\n\nRegarding your three points of moulding ourselves are good ones. I agree with training and ritual and taboo but do have some issues with partner selection.. Could this, in fact, be viewed within the same premise as my original post - that we are having to fundamentally change ourselves in order to progress? That it might take 10,000-100,000 more years of evolution to attain that 'near-perfect' goal? My original point still stands if that is the case. Additionally, changes are occurring - brain sizes have shrunk in the last 20,000 years:\n\n&gt;*\"Over the past 20,000 years, the average volume of the human male brain has decreased from 1,500 cubic centimeters to 1,350 cc, losing a chunk the size of a tennis ball. The female brain has shrunk by about the same proportion.\"* [link](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/sep/25-modern-humans-smart-why-brain-shrinking#.UpTRMMTIbD8)\n\nIs this getting dumber or more efficient wiring? We don't know yet.. but again it points towards the premise of my question. Maybe a combination of brain/biology changes, selected by cooperative living is the manner in which the goal will be achieved? Still requires that fundamental change though...\n\n&gt;*Nearly all the violence in this society is committed by men.*\n\nI would be hard pressed to disagree with this, although do always love a source :). I don't think your comment is sexist providing it is empirically true (which I suspect it is). So, what we have is violent and aggressive males.. charming and intelligent ones, who express said negative traits in more subtle ways. It could be signing a document that commits a nation to war without doing any of the killing themselves. The problem is that these types of people, most often men, will typically rise above the rest. Now, we have to recognise why. If society or culture were different then maybe these types of personality would never get anywhere.. but as soon as one expands beyond a small tribal community you will typically witness such personalities residing at the top (I need a source for this, but reading the news and about any top govt decisions it seems to strongly implicate this), even if it's behind the scenes/head of a corporation etc. Why is this? I 'think' it's because certain people are better at manipulating the primitive parts of our brains - things like confirmation bias. How many times have you shown someone empirical fact and it just strengthens their opposition to your point? Is class a by-product of personality traits?\n\nAll of these questions are trying to expose the core, underlying reasons for why society is the way it is. I don't think blame can be pinned on one specific thing, gender or hormone.. but more a complex web of interactions in an uncertain environment. Can we change our environment, through some of the methods you highlighted, reduce scarcity etc. and eliminate the need of fundamental changes to ourselves.. I don't have the answer. I keep seeing the same human patterns repeat themselves over and over and over. Yes, to some degree, they get 'less bad' than the previous cycle. But as discussed elsewhere here, is there a bottom limit to this power-law curve that cannot be crossed without fundamental changes? I don't know. I would like to remain optimistic.. but haven't been convinced yet :s.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385485470", "subreddit": "Transhuman", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
