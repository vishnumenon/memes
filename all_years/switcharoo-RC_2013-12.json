I'm sorry I couldn't make it anymore clear than that.\n\nA ton of the comments with lots of upvotes are specifically calling you out on not talking to the owner or manager. And nowhere in your post does it say you talked to an owner or manager. This is what there is: \n\n&gt; The dude at the counter\n\n.\n\n&gt;the gentleman behind the counter\n\nAnd even in your own comment (when someone suggested talking to the manager, I believe): \n\n&gt;The manager already knows, considering they just lost $300 in profits.\n\nSeems to imply the manager knows because of the profit loss, not because you were speaking to him (you were actually just speaking to \"the dude at the counter\", according to you).\n\nThen, like a dick, you say: \n\n&gt;But when the owner (as i said in the story, if you would learn to read) pulls that stunt\n\nYou did not say that in the story. You wouldn't come across as a dick here \"if you would learn to write\". \n\nEither you did really just talk to \"the dude at the counter\" and for whatever reason didn't talk to the manager, did a chargeback and now are condemning the store because of 1 idiot \"dude at the counter\" and are backpedaling now because people are saying you should have talked to a manager or owner, or you are an idiot and don't know how to convey your story with correct words, while contradicting yourself, and berating someone else asking about the discrepancies in your story telling him he can't read (can't read words that are not there, it turns out). \n\nOr you are just making it up. My guess is you are backpedaling. Or maybe you are illiterate while calling others so (I'm specifically being a dick to you about it because you were being a dick to the other guy for not reading words you never wrote, while at the same time contradicting yourself the whole way through [and that other person was the one who called you out on that - but he did it very politely too]).

{"body": "\"No Phil, you're a lunatic. Besides, I'm pretty sure you just killed my wife.\"\n\n\"Whatever, asshole. Good luck surviving without these.\"\n\nHe holds up his bag of veggies and shakes it at you. Whatever, you don't need him. \n\nYou go back to your car. The engine is totally shot. Plus, the caustic vomit that monster sprayed ate away the passenger side tires. There's a tire iron in your trunk. You think about using it to knock Phil out and take his vegetables, but when you turn around, he's already gone.\n\nYou go back in your house and scrounge through the remains of your kitchen. Most of the food is ruined, but you find a head of lettuce and two avocados. They'll have to do.\n\nAs you head outside, you feel your pocket buzz. You've got a text message from your brother.\n\n[Hey kid u dead yet? lol jk]\n\n[No, but there's a bunch of monsters overrunning the city.]\n\n[Lol we got em here too]\n\n[One of them puked all over my wife.]\n\n[LMFAO!!!]\n\nIdiot. Whatever. You try 911 again. Still busy. You try calling your brother to yell at him for being an idiot, but get redirected to an automated service. It looks like the cell towers are overloaded and the only thing getting through are texts.\n\nYou head outside, cradling your tiny stock of ammo in your arms. Downtown is only twenty minutes on foot. With a little luck, you just might make it.\n\nYou run down the street, your heart pounding. The electric grid has gone down and you can only see by patches of moonlight that filter through the clouds. You try to keep to the shadows, but there's really point. The monsters can track you by smell. Hopefully, the scent of the vegetables will ward them off.\n\nYou reach the outskirts of downtown. There's a dim glow in the distance. It must be where the military has set up base. You're winded, but you force yourself to keep running toward it.\n\nYou can see a makeshift wall barricading the street ahead. As you get closer, you hear a low grumble coming from an alleyway.\n\nYou freeze. Slowly, a ball of blue fur emerges, sniffing the air. It's the biggest cookie monster you've ever seen. At least twelve feet tall, and so fat it could crush a car just sitting on it. It sniffs the air. You're body tries to void its bowels again, but you clench your sphincter tight.\n\nIt starts to turn back into the alley.\n\n♫ *Don't stop, believin'! Hold onto that feeeelin'!* ♫\n\nThe sound is coming from your pocket. It's your idiot brother calling you back. The monster turns and creeps toward you, its great maw gaping, drool slobbering down its chin. You hurl the phone away, but it looks like the monster has your scent. You wait until it's only a few feet away and chunk the head of lettuce at its mouth. It catches it with one claw and crushes it.\n\n\"ME WANT COOKIES!\"\n\nIt blasts a stream of projectile cookie vomit at you. You roll out of the way just in time. The puke begins to sizzle on the concrete. The monster starts to charge you, but you throw an avocado and land it right in the monster's mouth. It chews it for a moment, the spits it onto the sidewalk. You can't believe it.\n\n\"Fuck, why didn't that work?!\"\n\n\"AVOCADOS FRUIT.\"\n\n\"Wait, can you understand me?\"\n\n\"COOKIES!\"\n\n\"God damn it.\"\n\nYou chuck the last avocado. It hits the monster in the eye. The monster shakes its head and paws at its face.\n\nYou sprint to the barricade wall and bang on the side of it.\n\n\"Help! Let me in God damn it!\"\n\nNo response. The monster rolls over and gets ready to pounce. You look around. There's no where to run and nothing you can use to defend yourself. The monster charges toward you. You cringe and close your eyes.\n\nFlood lights switch on all along the barricade wall. Two members of the national guard pop over the side with automatic rifles and open fire. The monster recoil, and runs off into the city, howling.\n\nYou look up at the guards.\n\n\"Oh God, thank you so much, I thought I -\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nOne of the guards trains their gun on you.\n\n\"What are you -\"\n\n\"I said shut up. That monster puked at you, didn't it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but -\"\n\n\"We need to be sure you're not going to change into one of them. There's a quarantine area inside where our medics will examine you, but at the first sign of you starting to turn, I *will* put a bullet in your head. Do you understand?\"\n\nAs you nod in agreement, you look down and see a tiny bit of puke on your sleeve. It looks like the monster clipped your clothing, but you don't feel any different.\n\n___\n\nDo you:\n\n[ ] Go into the barricaded area to be examined.\n\nor\n\n[ ] Escape into the city and take your chances.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386791194", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here is my growing-out-your-hair info dump!\n\nSome wisdom for the long haul:\n\n* **Conditioner: use it**, even if you don't think you need to. I used to avoid conditioner because it made my hair stringy, and boy do I regret it. About three months ago my ends started to split like crazy.\n* **Use sulfate-free shampoo, and only wash when you need to**. I wash my hair once every four days or so. I find this helps to keep it from drying out. I think this is common knowledge.\n* **Use the lowest possible heat when styling**. Once your hair is long enough to curl or require blow drying, experiment to find the lowest heat setting that will still get the job done. I was dumb not to do this, and it fried my ends.\n* **Get sea salt spray**. Holy shit, why did no one tell me about this stuff earlier? My hair is fine, straight and slippery, and this stuff adds texture to support sweet 'dos (like mohawks, yay!) that would otherwise require basically a whole can of hair spray. You can splurge and buy a bottle, but I prefer to [make it myself](http://wellnessmama.com/5054/diy-beach-waves-spray/) with coconut and argan oils (both available at Whole Foods or any health food store).\n* **Fringe is your friend**. I found that when my hair was at its stupidest lengths, keeping my bangs trimmed help to make it look more like an actual style. I trolled your posts for photos and I think you could carry it off, but also beware of [huge bang sections](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xaoyEOSW1rajdqwo1_1280.jpg). I let my stylist talk me into a [super 80s Euro bang](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xavj4UXu1rajdqwo1_1280.jpg) that went basically from ear to ear, and it took a year to grow the side pieces out. Here's a [hilariously overexposed photo of how it looks now](http://i.imgur.com/Q5x5JPZ.jpg).\n\nSome products that I love on my hair:\n\n* [TIGI Catwalk Session Series Styling Cream](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/tigi-catwalk-session-series-styling-cream): this was a blind splurge for me and I love it. I do soft waves in my hair a lot and it helps keep the strands smooth and bouncy, and I can rub a little of this into the ends to tame winter static.\n* [Joico Joilotion Sculpting Lotion](http://www.joico.com/products/joilotion/) is my favourite blowdry serum ever. It makes my strands feel thick and strong and provides a lot of body. It also helps tame static.\n* [TIGI Bedhead Epic Volume Shampoo](http://www.bedhead.com/en/#/products/wash-and-care/everyday-care/epic-volume-shampoo) is my go-to shampoo for about a year now. It rinses out a bit better than other sulfate-free shampoos I've tried. You can get this cheap (under $20 for a 26oz bottle) at Marshall's/TJ Maxx/HomeGoods.\n* [My Mason Pearson Boar Bristle Brush](http://www.masonpearson.com/choose.html). My mom got this for me for Christmas last year and I freaking love it. I never use it on hair with product in it. Not even sea salt. It feels great on my scalp and seems to leave my hair less staticky than the other brushes I own.\n* [Coconut oil](http://www.amazon.com/Coconut-Oil-Bodycare-15-Ounces/dp/B0011DKJY2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386862996&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=spectrum+raw+coconut+oil) is my favourite thing. I use it as a deep conditioning treatment on dry hair, all over my body when I get out of the shower, on my face to keep blemishes at bay (my skin is very dry), and as a makeup remover. It's [literally](http://burjintheburbs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/chris-traeger_pr1.jpg?w=558) the best ever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386863591", "subreddit": "FancyFollicles", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.\n\n&gt; Firstly, the Prophet ﷺ did not marry a child.\n\nCan you provide the hadiths that state Aisha was 16?\n\nThere are at least 4 that I found in the Sahih Al-Bukhari only two of which are listed in the link I provided from http://www.muslim.org\n\n&gt; Secondly, marriage in Islām comes under ʿurf, that is culture, or cultural norms. As it is generally considered reprehensible almost in every corner of the world to marry a ‘young adolescent’ (not child), then it would not be sanctionable to do so, in our age\n\nInteresting I have never heard about this. Can you provide any other information about this I can read up on? \n\n&gt; Our scriptures also speak of God ‘creating people for the fire and the garden’. God doesn’t capriciously decide okay this guy is going to go there, and this guy there. God creates them and assigns their destination depending on His Foreknowledge of their own volitional actions and beliefs in life — likewise for God guiding and misguiding people in life with regards to belief in Islām.\n\nSo is there any free will in determining your faith if you have already been created for the fire? What is the point if it's all been laid out already?\n\n&gt; Well, that would naturally depend on what they’ve done to us today in our world. If they’ve done nothing, then there’s nothing to forgive.\n\nSo in of Surat At-Tawbah (Surah 9) what does this mean in the context of Islamic history?\n\n\"And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\" 9:5\n\nWasn't this the very impetus toward the early Muslim expansion of the Rashidun and the Ummayids? Were these conquests and force conversions unlawful or lawful in terms of Islam?\n\n&gt; No. For further information regarding the ayah, Sūrat al-Baqarah 2:282\n\nThank you, this only explains the the unequal ayat not the beatings. There are many videos regarding 4:34  out there but all of them say that beating your wife is allowed, which as a woman, is my primary concern.\n\n&gt;No. Where does it say they can?\n\nSorry, was not clear the ayat I linked to and the one previous state the following:\n\n\"And, behold, in the cattle [too] there is indeed a lesson for you: We give you to drink of that [fluid] which is [secreted from] within their bellies between that which is to be eliminated [from the animal's body] and [its] life-blood: milk pure and pleasant to those who drink it.\n\nAnd [We grant you nourishment] from the fruit of date-palms and vines: from it you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome sustenance..\" \n\nIf you read all of An-Nahl (Surah 16) it is about the good that God created for mankind, including grapes and the intoxicants derived from them. In other parts of the Quran it specifically states intoxicants in general whereas this ayat is specific to wine as one of the good things provided by God. \n\nAgain thank you for taking the time to thoroughly provide an explanation, I wish though it had been provided in my original post so there could be more discourse.

{"body": "Esteemed Zenos Poseydonius, \n\nI, Niat Thawkes, have come to bring you Tomes, Letters, Registers, Codices, Volumes, Books, Scrolls, Epistles, Fragments and Sigils. I have not physically ventured into the Old Academy; no, my efforts are much more sophisticated than hack-and-slash time travel adventures. Quests are for newcomers. I have come to a scholarly *agreement* with Hermaeus Mora, Lord of the Apocryphal, and in exchange for certain services he has rewarded me with the privilege to freely scour the infinitely manifold shelves of His realm. \n\nWith no further ado, I present to you a sample of the great gifts Apocrypha has to offer:\n\n* [Borgas, the Fool-King](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15rc90/borgas_the_foolking/), an authorless (?) ancient Nordic text which seeks to further ridicule and demonize High King Borgas of Winterhold, the End of Ysgramor, whose attacks on Valenwood under the Alessian banner led to a Wild Hunt which not only cost him his own life and those of countless other men, but which also contributed to the looming presence of Huntsbeasts in First Era Cyrodiil.\n\n* [Virtue, Ever Watchful - Part Seventh, Deceit](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15f1bx/virtue_everwatchful_part_the_seventh_deceit_merry/), a fragment of a much larger text written by a zero-summed individual. This story is a rare example of a rampant memetic affliction which spread among the population of Tamriel around 4E200, a mysterious Sheog-plague which caused the infested to doubt or vehemently deny the factual presence of the (Second) Interregnum Alliance War and the Planemeld in history books.\n\n* [Ruminations on Telvanni Governance](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1ocrc8/ruminations_on_telvanni_governance/). This fragment is the only known remaining evidence of the correspondance between Telvanni Archmagister [REDACTED] of Vvardenfell and his colleague and friend, Master Aryon of Tel Vos.\n\n* [The 36 Lessons of Vivec and Liber AL vel Legis](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1l0mk7/the_36_lessons_of_vivec_and_liber_al_vel_legis/). A most curious work, cross-referencing the infamous teachings of Vivec with the writings of a religious madman known as 'Crowley'. I have so far been unable to locate this man \n(going by his name, a Breton) in the space-time of Mundus, but helpful whispers from my Lord leads me to believe this individual and his works stem from an unseen world beyond ours. \n\n* [Aurbis 2: Colorful Boogaloo](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1p1fip/aurbis_2_colorful_boogaloo/), one of the obscurities produced by our favourite eccentric progenitor, Merrlen. While he was and/or will be one of the Venerated Few who built your Archive, the man and his work famously vaporized shortly afterwards under strange circumstances; certain conjecture by my descendants point to him having been integrated into the very Frame of the Archive. While the first part of this work can be found in the library, the Academy has, until now, been unsuccessful in securing this piece.\n\n* [The First of First Mate’s Void-Navy Conscription Speech](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1ka495/the_first_of_first_mates_voidnavy_conscription/) is the transcribed spore-dream of a spore-dream memory. It is exactly what it says.\n\n* Numerology in the Lessons, parts [One](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16cbg6/numerology_in_the_lessons_pt_1/) and [Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16cbvb/numerology_in_the_lessons_pt_2/). Yet another work which draws upon unknown and unexplainable sources to explore and dismantle the teachings of Vivec. The Rotten Deadite, the author of this essay, is well-known in academic circles focused on the teachings of the ALMSIVI not only for his great and esoteric insight, but also for the lengths he has gone to understand Vivec; most famous of his exploits are the meetings with the mysterious force known among the enlightened as the Elk.\n\n* [A Mediation on Creation and Divinity](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1075mu/a_meditation_on_creation_and_divinity/) is yet another text by the Rotten Deadite. This is a truly dangerous work, not for the uninitiated or unstable, as it directly touches upon the volatile element that is I. Handle with care.\n\nAs you can see, Lord Hermaeus Mora has shown himself very generous. While a tenebrous Master, he has expressed sympathy towards the goals and ambitions of our Academy, and so wishes to strike a deal; our knowledge in exchange for endless access to His. This is a highly charitable offer, which would greatly advance the building of this library. You cannot hope to decline, and attempting to do so would be foolish. He takes what He wants, and if you deny Him, Zenos Poseydonius, He will find anoth̼̱e̝c̘̬͇͙̱͖͕h̡̩̱i͙̤͖͎̤̦̭͞h͙̤͔͍͟ͅff̶́͏͔̤͚̻͍̠͕̩̮̤̠̦̘͔̗͎Ć̷͈̮̻̜̦̜̦̹̫̪̳̰̤͉̳͍̬͠ͅ0̵̢̳̦͖̱̞̩̼͍̟̝̘̺͈̲͔͎͟D̵̷̠̬͖̞͚̹̖̦͈̭͚̦͚̕͞ͅA̡͈͓̣̕$̰̗̝̼͕̠̘̰̘̹̜̦̬̗̖͘͟i̻͇͚͍̼̝̦̩̭̩̤̤͙̙̹̩͡i̢̛̠̪̥͖̥̫͍ͅk̶̴̙̗͍̯̪̼̝͖͚͕̠͕̲̞̜̱̫͇̞͘HA͈̗͎͓̱̹ͣͮ͊̍ͣ̀̑̾̋Ã̪͈̯̤̏ͣ̈́͐ͤ̿̕A̺͚͓͓͙̲ͦ̋ͪ̊͆̀", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387080900", "subreddit": "teslore", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You may be able to find a company that will (given your proper and complete CAD files,) make the molds and cast as many as you want for fairly short money. If you wanted to exploit horribly poor workers, China has many, many small manufacturing outfits that'll work cheap. America has 'em too, but not as cheap.\n  http://www.protolabs.com/resources/molding-design-guidelines/\n\nThere are lots of great how-to guides on YouTube and elsewhere. Smooth-On has their own quick guide videos, but tons of people make them. Smooth-On is the biggest maker of mold-making materials for the light industrial, consumer, art, and hobbyist markets. There are many others, though.\n\nGeneral idea:\n\n * Sculpt the master positive\n\n * Cover that in a [mold-making goo](http://www.smooth-on.com/a44/New-Mold-Max%3D-Stroke-Brushable-Silicone-Rubber/article_info.html), and put it into a rigid backing, like plaster of paris. That's your negative mold. If your piece is complex, you may need to learn about bridges to hold small elements in place, and channels for air to escape as you pour in the casting material. There are many RTV (room temperature vulcanizing) mold materials. If you have odd bumps, you want a more flexible, pliable material so you can remove your finished piece without cracking the mold. Other materials are high-durability, or are suited for different casting materials...\n\n * Cast new positives out of your desired casting material.\n\nThat's a huge simplification. Watch tutorials! Prop-makers and scratch-builders have some great ones.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDW1NKIfgQQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs9SBpday84\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HvPuvvuDQ\n\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/imacraftydiva/mold-making-casting-diy/\n\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Two-Part-Silicone-Casting/\n\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Mold-Making---Mass-Casting-Complex-Parts-with-a-p/\n\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Mold-Making-Glove-Molds-and-Mother-Molds/\n\nGoogle \"mold making\" and \"how to cast objects\" -- stuff like that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387452787", "subreddit": "product_design", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
