{"body": "Yes of course being gay is a sin don't fall for those left-wing liberals (lol just kidding that's not my answer.)\n\n&gt;And I've read many articles from different sources stating something about this \"gay gene\", which can apparently greatly influence your sexuality, or even decide it.\n\nI have two older brothers who are identical twins. They have the same DNA. One is a transgender atheist, the other is a God-fearing straight Christian. There is no gay gene. We were all raised in the same house with an idyllic childhood. Even my atheist brother admits his childhood was amazing. On the other hand, I don't believe people just wake up and say \"I think I'll be gay today,\" but I also reject the genetic argument.\n\nIf people are genetically predisposed to homosexuality, it makes no difference. According to wikipedia, [there is a genetic factor involved in alcoholism too] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism#Genetic_variation) but we don't go around expecting churches to sell beer on sunday and stop preaching against drunkenness because \"some people are born that way.\"\n\nIf we are going to use the genetic argument, we have to go all the way with it. It sounds like the scientific *industry* is scrambling to find some genetic cause for homosexuality so that they can finally say it's not a choice and can't be morally wrong. I'm confident one day they'll find it too, but I don't think it'll be real.\n\nBUT EVEN IF I AM WRONG, and gay people are truly born that way and are forced into this lifestyle by some genetic factor that causes them to lust after the same gender, do you know what Jesus said?\n\n*\"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" (John 3:3)*\n\nSo even if I am wrong, and the LGBT community is born with this gene that forces them to sin against God, Jesus bids them to die to themselves and be born again, just as the homosexuals in Paul's day were, whom Paul commended as being washed and sanctified in the Spirit of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11)\n\nJesus loves homosexuals and died on a rugged cross for them, so that they could die to themselves and be born again by the Spirit of God, not so that they could be encouraged to continue in sin.\n\nNobody said it'd be easy, but blessed is he who overcomes, for God will be his Father, and he will be God's child.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389306184", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 3, "controversiality": 1}

I've become better at managing it over the years knowing most of the triggers now (and generally caring less over time, I've dated plenty of girls, that alone tells me that even if I WAS the ugliest person in the world it can't be the deciding factor.)\n\nThe thing that is hardest to explain though is how it doesn't really matter to me so much if OTHER people think I'm ugly, good looking, beautiful, or not. Sometimes it's as simple as the fact that when I look in the mirror honestly I simply don't feel like it's the person I am. It's strange to feel disconnected and hate yourself because of it.\n\nAnyway.. I'm rambling on and honestly trying to not go into too many details because if I explain too much it could trigger something. But just so you know, if you ever want someone to talk to about it (even if yours doesn't relate at all) I'm a pretty damn good listener and I might even be able to help you, just from my experience (I'm 28 and I've been dealing with it since around 16) might be able to offer some advice.\n\nBut yeah, trust me, you'll be alright. NEVER think that you're somehow inferior to anyone else because of something that, at a base level, we have absolutely no control over.\n\nIt fascinates me most of the time that people are even ABLE to call, or think, that other people are ugly when it's something you didn't choose or not choose.

{"body": "This post has been lightly edited for spelling/grammar/punctuation reformatted for easier reading:\n\nThis is a little bit of a longer story, of myself. Thought is is long, its worth the time.\n\nEver since I was 5 my family and i have hunted for food. We own a grocery store and were basically dirt poor. Our only food came from three sources: the garden, hunting, or damaged food items from our store. All of my family would go to work once they were 12. Why? one may ask. It turns out that my father had to barrow over one million dollars to purchase the two stores. after the payment on the store our family of seven was left with 1,100 dollars. \n\nWhen i turned twelve, my father sold one store and payed off the loan, leaving my family enough to buy a nice home and pay off the loan. Suddenly, in 2009, a town that stole much of the tourist revenue had a major loss due to a fire. My family had struck gold. We continued to hunt.  In fact we loved it! it was a spiritual bonding moment for my entire family. But we no longer ate the animals, instead we donated it to two mentally retarded people that work for us, and we still do today.\n\nHunting never was, and never will be, all about the kill. it was a trip we took to capture food that our god had put on our planet. we are not blood-thirsty savages. In fact we did not enjoy the moments of the animal dying. we would pray and thank god for the wonderful opportunity. We were never wasteful, we took everything we possibly could, bones for the dogs, hide for the taxidermist, meat for the workers, and antlers for the wall. My living room has become a mosaic of antlers. \n\nNow before you become angry, allow me to finish. \n\n[next paragraph is very violent]\n\nMy desire for hunting was astonishing. I enjoyed becoming part of nature and gathering my food; however all of this changed dramatically in one event. I was sitting in a tree stand, the light fog and breeze set a beautiful zombie tone. I heard a rustle in the leaves behind me. It was a younger doe, which is the exact tag I had. I clutched my bow and anchored an arrow as the doe walked behind a tree. I peered at it, maybe 10 months old, basically a fawn. I waited until it was behind another tree, I then drew my bow back silently and gather my excitement. I felt an odd tickle on my back and then a pinch. A MOTHER FUCKING SPIDER BIT ME! It caused my to shoot prematurely. \n\nThe arrow sprung into the fawn's spine causing the animal to scream a demonic pitch. Through a series of events i had to look in its eyes and watch it take its last breath as blood trickled from its nose. \"Why did i have to kill animals if I didn't have to?\" I thought to myself. I told my father about it but he couldn't understand why I felt sympathy for the animal. \n\nA few weeks passed and i forgot about the event. I enjoyed my meat and milk for a few more weeks. The next month two major events happened. I began to date a vegan guy [yes, im gay], and I joined the fire department. \n\nThe vegan meals he prepared were amazing! I learned to make a few so I could be romantic and shit but other than that I never really thought about it. Late in the month I got a call with the fire department for a motorcycle vs. car accident. When I arrived I found a man, with his spine broken, and almost dead. I was one of the first ones on the scene, and there was no ambulance. I still remember holding this stranger's head telling him he would be okay, even though I knew he was going to die. I remember looking into his eyes and listening to his breathing slow down. He kept gasping, telling me things to tell his mother. After three or four sentences he gasped harder and harder. It's as if he could not get enough air. I stared into his eyes, feeling hopeless because I was the only one around him and there was not a damn thing I could do. \n\nHe gasped hard and fast one lat time, and then I saw it. the soul leave his eyes. That moment when an eye goes from full of life to hollow and empty. I felt weak and worthless as I performed CPR for 15 minutes until the ambulance got there. Mentally I had been through an incredibly hard time. But oddly enough I remembered that doe. the one *I* had killed, for fun. \n\nThat's when I decided to stop hunting, but that was not enough. I stopped eating meat and became vegetarian, but that wasn't enough. I finally found peace in myself and stopped my anorexia [that's a whole different story too] by becoming vegan. I found peace in myself and support from /r/vegan[1] . Then one day there was a rant against hunters on here, and since I was new to the community and concept, I felt that I'm still a hunter. I mean it hasn't been but a few months since I last drew blood. I still have antlers on my wall and I still watch the hunting channel. How was I not a hunter? In an attempt to tell my story I said that i was a hunter. I was expecting to get to tell my story, but instead I got a lot of down votes and hateful comments. But that's not what I wanted, so i figured I would tell my story now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390854100", "subreddit": "vegan", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

Some biological molecules such as [ribosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome) fit this definition. This is because they receive instructions from [messenger RNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA) and then assemble specific sequences of [amino acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids) to construct [protein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) molecules.

One of my guilty pleasures is Star Wars lore (Darth Bane Trilogy is one of my faves) so please don't think it's because I \"just don't get it\".  It's not the theme, it's just the design.  But I'm not here to shame, I am here to help and I genuinely \n\n1) want Star Wars themed invitation to happen and \n\n2) for them to be the best thing ever.\n\nThere are some Star Wars wedding invitations out there that balance a nod to the theme with solid design principles and wedding invitation format.\n\n[Dark versus Light](https://www.etsy.com/listing/155830417/sample-star-wars-light-side-dark-side?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=product_listing_promoted&amp;utm_campaign=weddings_low&amp;gclid=CI6Fp9Sxp7wCFREaOgodDFIAIA)\nI would ask this designer to swap out Yoda and Darth for Sith and Jedi symbols.
