What we did is we got him alot and I mean alot of city sets. Mainly cause he can relate to them. As far as superhero sets he enjoys playing with them.\n\nMain thing I can suggest is teach them how to read instructions. We keep all our books in plastic sleeves inside 3 ring binders. He will go get the book or ask the wife or I for it and he will rebuild it. Keep your minifigs somewhere seperate. \n\nWe got the three drawer storage box. It has inserts for one drawer that we use for figs.\nAnd all our cmf we keep in the green storage cmf boxes.\n\nWe let him mess around with city people. As they are easy to come by. Also we have found thay since we put all our sets in the basement we seem to keep all the pieces. Much easier to find on concrete I promise. Legos and kids goes together so you cant get mad or let your ocd take over when you have a youngan.\n\nUsually what I do is put all the sets back after he goes to bed. Oh almost forgot dont waste your time with one set at a time when you have kids or kid. They will pester the shit out of you the whole time while you are building that one set. Now if they know you got another then they tend to play with the first one for a while.\n\nWe have all our sets on tables as well as of right now we dont display them cause we spent all the money on legos lol.

{"body": "I'm assuming that when you say \"biblical canon,\" what you mean is (early) *Christian* canon. \n\nOf course, understanding the much earlier pre-Christian processes of \"canonization\" would be even more complex - and I could only really refer you to detailed studies like Fantalkin/Tal's \"The Canonization of the Pentateuch: When and Why?\" and Dempster's \"From Many Texts to One: The Formation of the Hebrew Bible.\" \n\nWhen we get to the last couple of centuries before the Common Era, we see a rise of Jewish sectarianism, with individual 'sects' (to the extent that we can even locate these in history) having their own writings that are sometimes not accepted by others. Further, as we see the Hellenization of Judaism, we have Jewish works written in Greek for the first time. And this sort of Hellenistic Judaism was also not exactly looked on fondly by other sects – including the later Rabbis who we associate with \"orthodox\" Judaism.\n\nChristianity was born into this environment of sectarianism: many early Christians were inheritors of these various traditions. This included early Christians' use of things like the book(s) of Enoch, which would never become a part of the accepted Jewish canon - and would also fall out of favor among later Christians. Here I might direct you to a [long post I made here about changing attitudes (in the early Christian church) toward the Book of Enoch](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1j86hn/why_are_the_books_of_enoch_not_included_in_the/cbc5g46), ultimately leading to its demotion from 'canonical' status (despite its common use in the church).\n\nWhatever aspects of Hellenized Judaism that would later be found objectionable to the early rabbis were also present in early Christianity. After all, the New Testament was written in Greek - and it was the Greek translations of all the books of what's now considered the canonical Hebrew Bible that were used, by the NT authors. Some of these Greek translations contain significant variants (and *corruptions*) compared to the Hebrew text (though there are also places where the Greek translations preserve a more accurate reading, where the *Hebrew* text has become corrupted).\n\n______\n\n\nAs for early Christian literature itself: imagine that, as 'Christianity' is born for the first time, it takes a while for it to get off the ground. In the first two or three decades after Jesus, there may be a few less \"formal\" writings floating around: some of the Pauline epistles, earlier collections of sayings/mini-narratives, like [Q](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_source), etc. Then, around the year 70, you start to see more \"formalized\" literature (like the earliest full gospel); and 30 years after *this*, as it's grown more, you have a dozen or two of these writings: additional gospels, pseudepigraphical epistles, things like Revelation, etc. By the middle/end of the *second* century, we're in a kind of literary Renaissance for Christianity, with all types of writings in all literary genres from all sorts of different Christian sects. \n\nYet the modern (canonical) New Testament is mostly composed of a fairly early stratum of writings: ranging from a couple that were written around the year 50, to others that were composed in the early second century (and maybe a couple pushing towards the middle of the 2nd century). \n\nThere are multiple reasons for this. One might be that, as time went on, Christian sects developed that were wildly divergent from what Christianity was like in the first couple of decades; and, just like in the earlier Jewish sectarianism situation, their writings didn't gain wide acceptance outside of certain niche communities (though the situation with Christianity is kind of unique: for example, just look at how different the Gospel of John is from the other three gospels, theologically speaking).\n\nAnother reason is a bit more obvious: the earliest Christian writings would have had more time to be disseminated, and so virtually *all Christians* would have (eventually) been aware of them. For example, as opposed to their being early, independent \"competitors,\" things like the so-called Gnostic gospels (and the Gospel of Thomas, etc.) *built upon* the earliest authoritative Christian writings (the epistles of Paul, the four gospels, etc.), reconfiguring them.\n\nAnother consequence of the early dissemination of Christian writings is that – to the early church fathers – their antiquity automatically entailed their authenticity/authority; which was aided by the authority of the various personages associated with them. Early Christian presbyters/theologians/writers like Papias and Irenaeus and others (in the second century) still had \"memories\" of their direct predecessors ascribing authorship of certain gospels to people that were personally known. Or perhaps it's *several* degrees removed: their predecessors' predecessors, or theirs (even in the early 2nd century they speak of the \"ancient\" or \"old\" Christians). \n\nFinally, one other factor is coherence of *style*/*theology*. Someone could forge an epistle in the name of, say, Paul – which was done many times, even in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries (cf. the epistle to the Ephesians [and possibly/probably Colossians, too], Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy, etc.) – but if it appeared to speak with a genuine Pauline authority (and perhaps cohered somewhat with certain aspects of Pauline style, vocabulary, etc.), its authenticity wouldn't be widely challenged... especially, of course, if the circumstances of its forgery weren't known. Interestingly, we do have (purported) instances where a forger was caught \"in the act.\" For example, the early Christian author Tertullian mentions that a presbyter was actually caught in the process of forging the [Acts of Paul/Thecla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Paul).\n\n_____\n\nIf anyone's interested in much more detailed studies of all these things, I'd recommend Luc Zaman's *Bible and Canon: A Modern Historical Inquiry* and Timothy Lim's *The Formation of the Jewish Canon*.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392322511", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Cute mani! Also, your husband is one lucky guy because that cake looks yummy. \n\n(1) Since you used to crochet, I absolutely recommend [amigurumi](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mJ47MLlrLzw) as a new craft / hobby. You might still have some crochet hooks and yarn hanging around, I'm hoping, so it shouldn't be expensive for you to try it out. I didn't learn from the tutorial I linked but it's extremely thorough and has tons of great tips for beginners. All you need to know is how to chain and single crochet. Easy, yeah?!\n\nI enjoy amigurumi because it's fun and challenging at the same time. You can make so many cute toys for your kids to play with because there are tons of free patterns available from websites and blogs like [Nerdigurumi](http://nerdigurumi.com/2012/12/chubby-cat-bunny-bear-or-pig-amigurumi-pattern.html). Once you learn the basics, the possibilities of what you can make are endless.\n\nI'm very proud that I taught myself to crochet. Here are some amigurumi that I've made:\n[Heart pens](http://imgur.com/6G7IYAG) for Valentine's Day 2013, [little ladybug](http://imgur.com/a/XUTN5), [Reddit Snoo](http://imgur.com/a/P3GHC) (my own original pattern), [Flamies](http://imgur.com/4vbpj5e) (a Roxycraft pattern), [mushrooms](http://imgur.com/KSlkA6b) from the Mario video games (I never added the eyes, oops), and a [rainbow panda bear](http://imgur.com/HanSjsM) from an amigurumi book.\n\nI haven't crocheted in a while because I've been focusing on my nail art but I love amigurumi and hope you consider giving it a try. Don't hesitate to ask me questions if you have any. :)\n\n(2) As far as a new nail design to try, I like to keep the [skittlette]( http://www.chitchatnails.com/2013/06/12/skittlette-how-to-dress-your-nails/) in mind when I choose colors for a mani. It challenges me to use more of my polishes and expands the number of techniques I use in one look. Also, if I find myself leaning more towards purple one week, I'll try to pick more blues or greens the next week. Just to add more variety and challenge my normal color palette.\n\nThanks for the gauntlet!\n\nEdit: formatting ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393541078", "subreddit": "PolishGauntlet", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
