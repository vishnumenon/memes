[Bears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear), [lions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion), [tigers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger), and [wolves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf) were among those who escaped, and were hunted by local law enforcement out of fear for public safety. The animals were either killed, or captured and taken to the [Columbus Zoo and Aquarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium).  Owner Terry Thompson set free fifty-six of his exotic animals before shooting himself in the head. Forty-eight were killed by the local police.   The animals freed included lions, leopards, wolves, primates, bears,   and eighteen tigers.  The animals confirmed to be dead were the eighteen tigers, six black bears, two grizzlies, two wolves, one macaque monkey, one baboon, three mountain lions, nine male lions, and eight lionesses.  Three leopards, one grizzly bear, and two monkeys were left caged inside Thompson's home. These animals were tranquilized and sent to the [Columbus Zoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium).  One of the surviving leopards was subsequently injured in an accident at the zoo and was euthanized.  One monkey was eaten by a tiger, and a wolf was killed after being hit by a car. \n\n&gt;The animal farm had been repeatedly reported for inadequate and unsafe housing for the animals, as well as insufficient water and food. \n\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Zanesville, ^Ohio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanesville,_Ohio) ^| [^Columbus ^Zoo ^and ^Aquarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium) ^| [^List ^of ^former ^zoos ^and ^aquariums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_zoos_and_aquariums) ^| [^The ^Wilds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wilds) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfuzqlp) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cfuzqlp)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394033171", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "How much brides spend on their wedding will vary a lot based on location alone (as well as other factors).\n\nI'm in the Baltimore area, which is pricer than other areas. [Here's a link you can use to get an idea about your area](http://www.costofwedding.com/).\n\nFor an example, [here's mine](http://www.costofwedding.com/index.cfm/action/search.weddingcost?zipcode=21045). Here are a my comparisons:\n\n- Wedding Dress: $1,199 - $1,999; my dress was less expensive since I bought it as a sample, so I spent around $500 (it was a $2000 dress from 2009).\n\n- Hair Services: $67 - $111 This was low for me; I just put down a $150 deposit to book them, then my hair will be $80 day-of (they'll come to my mom's house) (it'll also be $80 for each bridesmaid)\n\n- Make-Up Services: $54 - $90 This is also low; again, that $150 above applied to this as well (so let's say $75 each), and then normal make-up would have been $70 (I'm getting airbrushed--$150)\n\n- Manicure &amp; Pedicure: $44 - $74 I'll go to my usual place; gel manicue for $30. Maybe a design, which will be $35. So I'm saving. If I do my toes, then tops $55.\n\n- DJ: $682 - $1,136 Is way low for what I saw; I'm paying $1800 (lowest was $1200, and both are for four hours). Then, for the ceremony (we're getting married at a church) there will be a fee for the organ player and I don't know yet what that will be; I'm assuming at least $200 for one meeting and the thirty minute ceremony.\n\n- Flowers Decorations (All rolled up): $1824 - $3037. I have a connection, so my flowers will all be $1500 (that was really lucky!). I could have expected closer to 3k.\n\n- Photographer &amp; Videographer (no album): $3561 - $6664 I am spending $4000; part of that is from getting a deal by asking for a videographer kind of late on a not-too-popular wedding day. Just photography would have been $2500 (comparable to $2571 - $5014)\n\n-Venue &amp; Catering (no rentals): $11,503 - $19,172 We are paying between $17,023.50 - $20,428.20, depending on how many people show (135 - 162). This is a premium open bar for four hours, one of which is a cocktail hour with three passed hor dourves and one hot station with a crab dip plus fruits and cheeses, then a served plated dinner including a salad, dinner, and sorbet, and a cake. This also covers linens, chair covers, place settings, etc. and a hotel room that night for FH and I (our reception is at a hotel).\n\nOverall, our budget is still within the $30,770 and $51,283 range for my area because we are saving in other aspects, although my guests are way less than what they listed (286 and 306 people). So take it with a grain a salt!\n\n**EDIT:** [This was pretty cool, too](http://www.costofwedding.com/index.cfm/action/costest.index)! I'm planning on using it after the wedding to see how I compared; it's estimating me at 45K and I am pretty sure we are closer to 30k/35k.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395950599", "subreddit": "weddingplanning", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
