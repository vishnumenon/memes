{"body": "Great discussion.  Keep it going!\n\nHaving said that, this particular reply from [holymoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/holymoo) begins to answer my original question in the way I imagined.  That is to say, I see a domain comprising these data types\n\n    type Account\n        field balance\n        field holdersName\n\n    type Withdrawal\n        field account\n        field amount\n\nand these \"business rules\"\n\n* Account.balance is a Decimal.  This is an invariant maintained by the primitives of the language.\n* Account.holdersName is a String.  This is an invariant maintained by the primitives of the language.\n* Withdrawal.account is an Account .  This is an invariant maintained by the object-oriented features of the language.\n* Withdrawal.amount is a Numeric.  This is an invariant maintained by the primitives of the language.\n* The creation of a new Withdrawal causes its amount value to be subtracted from the balance value of the Account it references.  This (i.e., balance) is a derived field.\n\nwhich fall into just two categories\n\n* Invariants\n* Derived fields\n\nMy conjecture is that all business rules (i.e. \"behavior\") in typical business applications[1] fall into just these two categories.  I.e., the \"complex behavior\" that DDD promises to tame is never really that complex.  Every business rule either asserts an invariant about the system, or it describes a piece of derived data.  But, I confess that this is just a conjecture.  So again I ask,\n\n*What behaviour can entities possibly have?*\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] I invoke the caveat \"typical business applications\" because I can imagine other types of programs that possess \"behavior\" that does not naturally or usefully fall into these categories.  Examples of these might include numerical simulations, games, compilers, operating systems, and networking stacks.  However, I'm not sure that very many people would recommend or even consider using Domain Driven Design for these types of programs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396417165", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Amazing.  I have acne scars, tons of hyperpigmentation, and dry/fussy skin with an oily chin area.  This stuff covers everything, feels incredibly light (I usually forget I have it on), and doesn't fuck with my skin.  It's also a dead-on, perfect match to my skin tone -- the shit literally looks like someone liquefied my skin and put it in a squeeze tube (gross).  PLUS it has sunscreen in it, which is a load off my mind in the morning!\n\n* [Eucerin lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Daily-Replenishing-Moisturizing-Lotion/dp/B00AYSBR96/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&amp;srs=2591470011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397169436&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=eucerin) (in the pump bottle, for ease of application).  Plain, unscented, glycerin-based, super effective.  I have been singing Eucerin's praises for years now, as someone in the healthcare/social service field who works with a lot of people who have very sensitive skin.  It's amazing.  I use it religiously on myself as well as in my work.\n\n* [Neutrogena Rainbath](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Rainbath-Gel-Original-Ounce/dp/B000052ZBD/ref=sr_1_7?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397169501&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=neutrogena+rainbath) just because it smells fucking incredible.\n\n* Lush's [Godiva Solid Shampoo](http://www.lushusa.com/Godiva/02392,en_US,pd.html#start=14).

The title is \"ЛИЦА РУССКОГО БУНТА\", plus he's part of the Borot'ba organisation, which has clearly come out as pro-Russian during this whole mess. I mean, when they were banned from protesting in Kharkiv a few days ago, [newspapers said it was pro-Russian demonstrations banned] (http://vesti.ua/harkov/46953-sud-zapretil-provedenie-mitingov-v-harkove)... How is a person who says \"Однако и цель федерализации, децентрализации также является приоритетной\" not pro-federalisation..?\n\nRe the woman: I must have overlooked a sentence, the only thing I found was her saying that she'd like: \"предоставление русскому языку статуса государственного наравне с украинским\". Not that it's 'oppressed', but that she'd like it to be on the same level. (As a side note, I don't know if I agree but I guess I kinda understand: it felt a little bizarre when we were selling our apartment and everybody spoke Russian: the realtor, my family, all the people involved in the legal matters, then we signed a document written in Ukrainian, and then everybody immediately went back to Russian again.) Maybe I missed it though, could you point to the sentence where she says it's oppressed?\n\nAs for some of them being ethnic Russians-- er, ethnic Russians living in Ukraine have the right to their opinion too, don't they? That doesn't make them drunk, ignorant, violent chavs, or over the age of 60. O.o I'm not saying their opinion is the only right opinion, but you were asking for examples and I tried to provide some. Do you have proof that they are the ones violently beating up fellow Ukrainians? Cuz if it's just 'their side', can I point you in the direction of, for example, [Tsarev being violently beaten up too] (http://www.segodnya.ua/politics/pnews/careva-snova-izbili-teper-v-kieve-512971.html)? I mean, I dislike the guy, but if we're going by beaten up Ukrainians... (And that's not even taking into account [the 31st Hundred] (http://npubop.livejournal.com/1882269.html), whose brutality was recorded by a relatively well-known pro-Maidan activist. The people they were beating are Ukrainians too.)\n\nI don't know how linking this is propaganda, I'm sorry. :(\n\nRe me: it's true that I joined reddit after lurking for some time because of this crisis. I have tumblr for my fandom stuff, I have ohnotheydidn't for my gossip stuff; never felt the need for a reddit account too. Would you like a link to those accounts? (I think I can dredge up an old neopets account too, if you really want.)

Jackie just has so much more energy in these films. But yeah, if anything start with the first police story. Another thing about Jackie Chan is that his stunt work is just absolutely brillent.\n\nJet Li is good too. I loved his [Once Upon in China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytBFqye5U4g) series. However, the these films are more of a wushu epic, so the style in these movies are fantasy-like as it is about a Chinese folk-hero. Fearless is another good one of his too.\n\nAnother good one is the 8-Diagram Pole Fighter. Gordon Liu stars in this one. [It has one of my favorite fight scenes of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoOXhoCJWn0).\n\nSome other good ones to check out are also Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, and Hero.
