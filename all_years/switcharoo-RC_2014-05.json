Named after urban activist and writer [Jane Jacobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs), Jane's Walks are held annually during the first weekend in May to coincide with her birthday.\n\n&gt;Jane's Walks are led by volunteers, and are offered for free.  The walks are led by anyone who has an interest in the neighbourhoods where they live, work or hang out. They are not always about architecture and heritage, and offer a more personal take on the local culture, the social history and the planning issues faced by the residents. \n\n&gt;Since its inception in 2007,  Jane’s Walk has happened in cities across North America. In 2009, over 10,000 people took part in a Jane's Walk  led by volunteers in 263 neighbourhoods in 24 towns and cities across North America.  Cities that have participated in Jane's Walk include [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcutta), [Calgary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary), [Halifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality), [Lethbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethbridge), [Ljubljana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana), [Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal), [Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa), [Sudbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Sudbury), [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto), [Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver), [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia), [Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Ontario), [Kitchener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchener,_Ontario), [Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Ontario), [Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg),  [Anchorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage), [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston), [Dayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton), Detroit, [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans), [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City), [Oakland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland), [Oklahoma City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City), [Omaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha), [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida), [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia), [Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona), [Salt Lake City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City), [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) and [St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis).  In 2009, a walk in [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai), India was added.  In 2011 the first Jane's Walk in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid) was held.

{"body": "EDIT - YUP as in 24 hours in Los Angeles, They are not 24 hours in all areas. \n\n--- \n\n[YUP!](http://i.imgur.com/mzkvDSx.png)\n\nI also included the rates in the image so you could see how cheap they are here. AND they are constantly trying to compete with Uber and other taxi's so they are always trying to innovate. A few weeks ago they updated the app so that you could add your destination within the app before you drive even arrived. Instead of getting in the lyft and having to tell the driver where to go, he gets an updated route on his GPS to your destination. Its things like that, that really made me a believer, well that and almost half price rides compared to normal taxis. \n\nSomething I couldn't comprehend until I tried it out was the idea that this car we were riding in would arrive to our destination and then we would get out and walk away. That's it. We wouldn't fumble with cash or cards and have to deal with the hassle if the taxi driver was going to be a prick about cards. Nothing. Just walk away and in a few seconds you'll hear a chime from your phone reminding you to rate your driver and then add a tip or not to your charge. Then click submit and the deed is done. \n\nAnother thing that's great is when you grab a lyft you get not only get a picture of your driver AND his car, but you also see him driving on the map so you can track him. This has come in handy when trying to time it doing things at the home (beer, getting ready, etc.).\n\nI'm not trying to be a spokesperson for Lyft and I apologize if I am. Uber was just as great in my experience though I have shied away from them because of the whole price hikes during peak hours and app issues that caused many users to have cab fairs in the hundreds. The one time I did use them, they were equal and as great as lyft. \n\nBut the main point is that it feels like cab services have finally hit modern times. Its sad that it couldn't have been real cabs, but hopefully this will push them to truly compete. \n\n----\n\n\nEDIT 2: The best way to explain the difference between taxis and Lyft/Uber is to compare Blockbuster and Netflix. Sure blockbuster worked okay, but you were annoyed by their services, their employees were disgruntled (I was one), and it all just felt like way too much work but there was no other solution. THEN netflix came along and it was DVD's to your door, they pay for shipping, and no late fees - how can they afford this? That's the difference. \n\n----\n\nEDIT 3: [Lincoln is 24 hours too](http://www.lyft.com/help?article=1517102)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399091980", "subreddit": "lincoln", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "#*Misconceptions* \nOh gosh there are so many misconceptions about Vodou that one of my friends Adam McGee actually just finished up his PhD dissertation writing about it! There are some[ older pieces too](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1388141?uid=3739696&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103748652641) that are worth a read if you have access to journals.  Probably some of the primary misconceptions are about the nature of the religion, zombies, \"voodoo dolls\", and the idea that Vodou is devoid of ethics or morality. There is a magical aspect to the worldview and there are people who work as bokor that \"practice with the left hand\" meaning they are willing to do magic that could harm or just be selfish. Within the larger Vodou religious system this kind of magic certainly exists but most people who initiate into the religion are actually forbidden as part of the rite from practicing that kind of magic (unless it is simply to reflect back something sent.) But voodoo dolls like you see in movies are a Western thing - they aren't used in Haiti and only until tourists started asking for them did they show up in New Orleans! Zombies also exist but they aren't flesh eating undead. There are two kinds of zonbi - a spiritual and a bodied. Zonbi ko kadav (a zonbi that is a body devoid of the gwo bon anj or big soul) is the ultimate punishment for someone who breaks serious social taboos and morality. It isn't contagious but it is deeply feared because the person can then be used as a walking automaton type slave. In fact, Elizabeth McAlister has written a lot about this and suggests that both kinds of zonbi reflect the history of slavery in Haiti.\n\nVodou is primarily about balance, family, and serving the spirits. The world should exist in balance and people have obligations to redistribute food, money, and other resources to family and community to maintain that balance. Balance also extends to ideas about the environment and people should respect and honor the land. There are deep ties to family and like many societies the elderly hold a special place. At death they go to the other side of the waters after a short period in a liminal state. There they can be served as ancestral spirits and they can have direct agency in the lives of their loved ones. But eventually they will be reincarnated and reborn on earth. The lwa are spirits who stay as spirits and are served by the larger community. They have a co-dependent relationship with the people who serve them but it is also a complex relationship that mimics families. It can be very loving but also demanding and at times frustrating for all involved. Connecting with the spirits is deeply spiritual and moving but it also provides a pathway for changing situations and getting a glimpse into things that are usually unknown. In this sense, people have a path set by God but serving the lwa can give you an edge and help you stay in a positive balance. \n\n#*Natural Disasters*\nThey of course impact the people's lives incredibly and in doing so their religious worldviews. One community I worked with in New Orleans was Sallie Ann Glassman's sosyete. She has a peristyle in the Bywater and she claims that the flood waters stopped about a block away from her temple. Locals who were not even practitioners felt that her good relationships with the lwa had helped save their houses. But every year they now hold a service to appease the spirits and protect New Orleans from another big hurricane. Katrina also split up her religious community and even now some of them have been unable to return. So in addition to grappling with how the spirits could let this happen there is also the added burden of reconstructing your religious community. Vodou really does require a fair number of people to hold a proper ceremony. \n\nIn Haiti things were even more dire and in some ways continue to be so. Their homes and temples were destroyed, they were sent to tent cities where rapes, violence, and theft were common, they didn't always know when their next meal would be, didn't have the ability to rebuild, and now things like the cholera epidemic prolong their problems. Right after the earthquake so many people died that the state and foreign assistance decided to put people into mass graves. It was understandable but it meant people never got the closure of knowing for sure their loved one died. And it also meant their loved ones were denied a proper burial and the family does not know where their bodies are located for future religious obligations to the dead. I was in Boston at the time and the community I know held a service mass for the dead. There were a number of reports of how Vodou services for the dead in Haiti had been disrupted sometimes violently by Evangelicals who had been told by American religious charitable groups that the earthquake was Vodouisants' faults. Religious violence began to escalate with people being forced to convert to certain forms of Christianity to get food and water and then blame going to Vodouisants for all of the pain people felt. There were reports that a number of Vodou priests were killed and many more temples were destroyed. Some very old Catholic Cathedrals and Free Masonry structures were also vandalized. So not only did it become somewhat dangerous to practice Vodou the diaspora community was worried these important ceremonies couldn't be held. So they were done from afar to the mass dead.

Sure you can use some as metrics to figure out better how people might think but psychology still has a lot to figure out about how people tick.\n\nAlso there is some irony to the MBTI subreddit membership numbers as a cross section of reddit users vs who would join a MBTI sub.

It can involve not only mass murder, but also starvation, *forced deportation*, and political, economic and biological subjugation.

Broken treaties mean nothing, especially when there were thousands of tribes.\n\nClearly on the above definition, \"forcing them to walk\" is evidence of genocide. They were \"forced to walk\" in order to forcibly relocate them, as part of an explicit effort to shatter their government and culture to make way for American expansion.\n\nYou also seem to underestimate the cruelty of \"forcing them to walk hundreds of miles\". Thousands of people died of exposure and starvation on the trail of tears. It's like saying \"sure, forcing Jews to take a crowded train might have been cruel, but...\"\n\nAlso, why do broken treaties \"mean nothing\"? The fact that treaties were made and broken (and are still not being respected) is evidence of the government's intent to mislead the indigenous people they were dealing with.\n\nWhy does the number of tribes have anything to do with the impact of breaking treaties? If someone broke a contract with you, would you find \"well, there are millions of Americans\" a compelling justification or mitigating factor?\n\nAnd where do you get your estimate for the number of tribes in North America?\n\n&gt;I don't think the US needs to address an issue this old. No one is currently alive that had their land conquered no one alive has conquered Indian lands. The idea that a certain race owes another race something for the transgressions of a previous generation is unfair and maybe racist.\n\nThis is not an issue from the past. The Canadian government used to run a system of \"residential schools\" where indigenous people were taken from there families, not allowed to learn or develop their languages, beaten and abused, stripped of their culture, and occasionally killed. The last government run residential school closed *in 1996*. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard testimony from these victims of the vestiges of the genocide *in March of this year*.\n\nAre these events in Canada similar to events which happened in the United States? Well, yes and no. [You guys had the schools too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools), but seemingly haven't gotten around to the \"Truth and Reconcilliation\" thing yet. But hey, it's in the past, right?\n\nTreaty obligations aren't about one race owing something to another. Governments existed in North America before the arrival of European settlers. Some of those governments exist today. Colonial governments, and eventually the federal government, formed treaties with these governments for various reasons.\n\n&gt;Native American culture, while not a great influence is still around. The native population has risen as a percentage since 1890 from .04 to .09\n\n[Then there are more jews per capita in Germany than there are indigenous people in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country)\n\n&gt;Hitler sought out to eliminate every Jew on the planet, while Jackson just wanted the land the Natives were sitting on.\n\n[No, he didn't. He wanted them off of the land he was trying to occupy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_Plan)\n\n&gt; No one has a birthright to a piece of land, it is part of the earth, whoever has the largest army and/or wants it the most gets it.\n\n...because they can kill the people who are already there, right?

They are medium-sized tortoises that generally average 30 centimetres (12 in) as adults, but can reach over 40 cm (16 in). They have a dark-colored loaf-shaped [carapace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carapace) (back shell) with a lighter patch in the middle of each scute (scales on the shell), and dark limbs with brightly colored scales that range from pale yellow to dark red. There are recognized differences between red-footed tortoises from different regions. They are closely related to the [yellow-footed tortoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-footed_tortoise) (*C. denticulata*) from the [Amazon Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin).

You patent a way of doing something. If someone else can come along and find another way to accomplish the same thing without using ANY of your methods, it's likely going to be OK (see something called [Clean Room Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) for a great example of how this can work with software patents).~~\n\n~~Copyrights are about results.

{"body": "#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n [**Political correctness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political%20correctness): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;__Political correctness__ (adjectivally, __politically correct__; both forms commonly abbreviated to __PC__) is a term that refers to enforced language, ideas, or policies that address perceived [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination) against political, social or economical groups (\"protected classes\") as defined by the [political left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_left). These groups most prominently include those defined by [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender), [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification\\)), [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity), [sexual orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation), age and [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability).\n\n&gt;Historically, the term was a [colloquialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism) used in the early-to-mid 20th century by [Communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) and [Socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) in political debates, referring pejoratively to the Communist \"[party line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_line_(politics\\))\", which provided for \"correct\" positions on many matters of politics. The term was adopted in the later 20th century by the [New Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left), applied with a certain humour to condemn [sexist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism) or [racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism) conduct as \"not politically correct\". By the early 1990s, the term was adopted by US conservatives as a pejorative term for all manner of attempts to promote [multiculturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism) and [identity politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics), particularly, attempts to introduce new terms that sought to leave behind discriminatory baggage attached to older ones, and conversely, to try to make older ones [taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo). This phenomenon was driven by a combination of the [linguistic turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn) in academia and the rise of identity politics both inside and outside it. These led to attempts to change social reality by changing language, with attempts at making language more culturally inclusive and [gender-neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language). These attempts (associated with the political left) led to a backlash from the right, partly against the attempts to change language, and partly against the underlying identity politics itself.\n\n&gt;In modern usage, the terms *PC*, *politically correct*, and *political correctness* are [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) descriptors, whereas the term __politically incorrect__ is used by opponents of PC as an implicitly positive self-description, as in the cases of the [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States), topical book-series *[The Politically Incorrect Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politically_Incorrect_Guide)*, and the liberal, television talk-show program *[Politically Incorrect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_Incorrect)*.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^The ^Death ^Camp ^of ^Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Camp_of_Tolerance) ^| [^Campaign ^Against ^Political ^Correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_Against_Political_Correctness) ^| [^Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) ^| [^Philip ^Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Davies) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+chscxyz) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+chscxyz)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401211556", "subreddit": "socialism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Bit off post, but I found this tangent to be interesting and I figured that you guys might too. Not exactly urban planning, but a path that lead to something neat. I already typed this up somewhere else so I'm just gonna repost it here.\n\nA tangent on trying to figure out the what those dead end roads that are really just severed road caused by the building of the highway are called.\n\n(For example, [N. New Jersey between 11th and 12th street.](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.7824057,-86.1506707,230m/data=!3m1!1e3) I-65 cuts across it and leaves behind two dead ends that aren't really dead end. On the other side, there's perfectly good road. But you cannot take that route because the highway towers above it, denying the use of the route. Many other examples follow highways [and railroads, I've been told too].)\n\nBut the tangent was caused by thinking about how I could find a term for that. Thinking about possible sources that I could look into, I thought about rivers. It is a living thing. So over the years, I thought, there must be dead sections of the river, caused by the shifting direction of rivers. There could be dead ends in a river, with another dead end at the end of dead section's path. Or even a bigger river crossing a smaller river's pathway and causing its death. And well, rivers have a bit more of history to it, more lengthy than highways. There could be already a term for those, and finding out that term for rivers could lead me down the right path for highway's.\n\nSo I googled stuff and [found this.](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/americas-achilles-heel-the-mississippi-rivers-old-river-control-st)\n\nThere's a really cool old map on there that shows the mapping of the Mississippi river over the years. [But it's small so you cannot really see the details.](http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/2011/ms_river_twoviews.jpg)\n\nI could've tried to find the original source.
