{"body": "I swam in high school (club and HS [polo too]) and am now an age group club assistant coach. I swam breaststroke. Here's some background...I went to a swim camp, was primarily a backstroker. I came back and swam the breaststroke in a small championship type meet. I went a 1:17, this was probably in late July. By February at the District meet, I got down to a 1:04 or something, I don't really remember. Then went a 1:01 or 1:00high my SR year. Dropped 17 seconds in a year and a half or so.\n\nThe one thing I do remember was working my ass off. The thing that carried me the most were my legs. I didn't and still don't, have a lot of upper body strength. I swam breaststroke really and shallow, not like you see with the dolphin type motion you see a lot of people swimming with.\n\nSome advice: SWIM. Don't focus on one stroke. You need to get your cardio up and build your endurance. Do some hard sets. I practiced in a 25 meter pool in HS, but one of my favorite sets was a set of 75's on the 1:10 and I was doing them breaststroke. Probably 1:00 for Yards. I think there were 16 of them.\n\nI come from the age of yardage being pounded on the swimmers. The club I coach with is the opposite, and a lot of the workouts people do across the sport are shorter, but as high or higher intensity.\n\nHere's some suggestions:\nswim some fast 25's. Here's a set I ran with some swimmers when I was filling in with our Senior group (keep in mind it was a recovery day).\n\n8 x 25 @ 0:45 Free Drill\n16 x 25 @ 1:00 Free SPRINT\n8 x 25 @ 0:45 Back Drill\n16 x 15 @ 1:00 Back SPRINT\n8 x 25 @ 0:45 Breast Drill (do two kicks to one pull, stretch out your stroke)\n16 x 25 @ 1:00 Breast SPRINT\n8 x 25 @ 0:45 Fly Drill\n16 x 15 @ 1:00 Fly SPRINT\n\nOne thing you don't want to do is burn yourself out. Swimming for 2.5 hours a day can be a lot, but it depends on intensity. You can get faster quicker by working on technique than just sprint work.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind too, is that you need to give your body rest. before HS, I would suggest at least a couple/few weeks break. Then your body won't be so tired and start to breakdown and then your training will mean nothing.\n\nTest your 100 Breast time. set that as the benchmark. Do it after a good warm up. Repeat the warm up a few weeks later and then get your time again. If you can't dive, do it off the wall. If you don't know what you're going, you don't know where you're at. Maybe 1:14 is too slow of a goal for you, maybe you need to shoot for 1:10 or 1:07?\n\nSorry if this is kind of scattered...Hope this helps. reply with questions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401981862", "subreddit": "Swimming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

A lot of the music WAS terrible - we only remember the good stuff now, there were [some absolutely awful pieces too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97RjuC9YeXg) that have thankfully mostly been forgotten.\n\nOf course the reaction to Disco was punk and harder rock, but disco definitely had an enduring influence into new wave, italo-house and onwards.\n\nThe same thing will happen with EDM.

I'm assuming for this response that by wargame, you mean cardboard chits and lots of combat.  \n\n**Cheap** - If you want super cheap to try out a game, download the print and play of [Napoleon at Waterloo](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3573/napoleon-at-waterloo).  Not much to print, simple rules, but gives you a flavor of hex and counter wargames.  \n\n**Introduction** - If you aren't sure how deep into wargaming you want to get, you can't really go wrong with Memoir '44.  I personally prefer Battlelore for my card driven miniatures game, but lots of people adore Memoir '44, and many eurogamers will play this, so you'll have more opponents.  \n\nBut with Memoir '44, you are going to be spending a good amount of money, so the idea of doing it cheap is already gone.  That being said, I suggest you just...\n\n**Go For It** - If you want to just get into real wargaming, I highly recommend Combat Commander.  The squad/unit level detail makes for fun games with lots of action, and really gives the wargame experience.  The rules take reading and reference the first several plays, but they are very accessible and it is a lot of fun to play.  Honestly, if you don't enjoy laying in bed and reading rulebooks, you should avoid wargames.  \n\n**Alternate Options** -  [Paths of Glory](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91/paths-of-glory) is a highly recommended game, and I haven't had the chance to play it, but I've read the rule book and can't wait to give it a try one day.  PoG is different because it is WWI, and is Corps level, rather than individual units and squads.  \n\n[Command and Color: Ancients](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14105/commands-colors-ancients) is another great title, and is a wooden block wargame, which is different from the others listed.  Can't go wrong with this one, and the price is reasonable, considering everything you get.  Used, this game is a steal.

These groups most prominently include those defined by [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender), [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification\\)), [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity), [sexual orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation), age and [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability).\n\n&gt;Historically, the term was a [colloquialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism) used in the early-to-mid 20th century by [Communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) and [Socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) in political debates, referring pejoratively to the Communist \"[party line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_line_(politics\\))\", which provided for \"correct\" positions on many matters of politics. The term was adopted in the later 20th century by the [New Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left), applied with a certain humour to condemn [sexist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism) or [racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism) conduct as \"not politically correct\". By the early 1990s, the term was adopted by US conservatives as a pejorative term for all manner of attempts to promote [multiculturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism) and [identity politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics), particularly, attempts to introduce new terms that sought to leave behind discriminatory baggage ostensibly attached to older ones, and conversely, to try to make older ones [taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo). This phenomenon was driven by a combination of the [linguistic turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn) in academia and the rise of identity politics both inside and outside it. These led to attempts to change social reality by changing language, with attempts at making language more culturally inclusive and [gender-neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language). These attempts (associated with the political left) led to a backlash from the right, partly against the attempts to change language, and partly against the underlying identity politics itself.\n\n&gt;In modern usage, the terms *PC*, *politically correct*, and *political correctness* are [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) descriptors, whereas the term __politically incorrect__ is used by opponents of PC as an implicitly positive self-description, as in the cases of the [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States), topical book-series *[The Politically Incorrect Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politically_Incorrect_Guide)*, and the liberal television talk-show program *[Politically Incorrect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_Incorrect)*.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^The ^Death ^Camp ^of ^Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Camp_of_Tolerance) ^| [^Campaign ^Against ^Political ^Correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_Against_Political_Correctness) ^| [^Euphemism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism) ^| [^Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ci4h699) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ci4h699)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402455032", "subreddit": "asktransgender", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
