{"body": "&gt; Whenever a relativist points out that different cultures have different moral standards, realists chalk that up to incorrect beliefs about morality. Isn't that just another non-verifiable belief? \n\nYou can of course always jack your standards of \"verification\" up high enough such that your preferred group of suspect beliefs becomes \"non-verifiable.\" In philosophy this is considered *ad hoc* and unmotivated. Rather, the philosophically honest way to go about this is to formulate an [epistemology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/), including a [moral epistemology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/), that is defensible on independent grounds, and then check what it says about moral disagreement. Moral realists obviously think that once we do this, it will tell us that moral disagreement is an example of people being incorrect, for various reasons.\n\nNote that this is far from the only thing the realist can say about disagreement - moral realists could admit that moral disagreement *might* be a problem if it were *actually* moral disagreement, but in fact almost all purported \"moral\" disagreement turns out to be disagreement about the facts. So, disagreement about abortion turns out to be disagreement about whether the fetus has a soul, disagreement about human sacrifice turns out to be disagreement about whether an angry god needs to be appeased so as to keep it from eating the world, disagreement about racism turns out to be a disagreement about whether people of a different race actually *are* shitheads, and so on. Clear all this up, the realist says, and there would be much less disagreement about morality.\n\n&gt; I think part of my problem with this is that I think belief is necessary to go from \"is\" to \"ought,\" but it seems like only \"is\" can be objectively verified.\n\nTo reiterate the point, you're going to need to give us some sensible way of coming up with standards of \"objective verification\" that rules out moral realism but doesn't rule out other things you think are sensible, which is much easier said than done.\n\n&gt;  But couldn't someone from a country that practices FC/FGM show their students gay porn and say, \"Look how immoral that is. That's how we know there is objective morality\"?\n\nThey could, yes, and if the realist were using this and this alone as the entire basis of their moral realism then this would be suspect. Notice that your point is also subject to the comments I made about about much moral disagreement turning on empirical disagreement. I suspect much opposition to homosexuality comes from false beliefs about homosexuals that bigots spread, plus the idea that homosexuality is \"unnatural\" in a non-moralized way, which thrives not just in non-Western countries but [on reddit too](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/29xt1l/in_what_way_is_homosexuality_natural/), [as you can see](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/29uo38/serious_redditors_against_gay_marriage_what_is/cioolzf).\n\nIncidentally, in a lot of countries that practice FC/FGM, it turns out not to be very difficult to get people to realize that FC/FGM is morally wrong - introducing them to the concept of human rights and so forth often does the trick. The practice tends to persist not because people are huge fans of it but [for other reasons](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/page5.html).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404775628", "subreddit": "askphilosophy", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The current paradigm is .. everything is a field. And when you interact with it, when you detect, measure, observe, scatter, bind anything then you interact with the field. Particles are just field excitations, energy packets raising the local region out of the ground state. And the ground state is constantly perturbed by virtual \"particles\" (that is the field is never completely at rest, there's noise).\n\nNow, atoms are special bound states of these fields. The nucleus with the amalgamation of everything described by quantum chromodynamics, quarks, gluons, and a lot of bound energy, [almost popping into existence](http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/). (Experiments and sophisticated models of QCD show that there is not exactly 3 quarks in a proton, but .. that it's a really dynamic, complex state with virtual everything, and forces interacting with anything anyway.)\n\n[Here](http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/)'s an other link from Prof. Strassler's excellent site, though I don't really like the \"explanation from uncertainty principle\". (But I'm a layman, but then again, I don't see how a rudimentary model of atom physics should be justified by one of it's features, it feels post-hoc to me. However, there's a calculation that have a nice result, so .. who knows, and with questions like this we're just entering the nasty world of [model-dependent realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-dependent_realism))\n\nFurthermore, in the [simple treatment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state#In_mathematical_quantum_physics), bound states apply equally to wave-packets and particles (because then wave packets have \"size\") and we don't really get any sane explanations.\n\nSo, even though we have very nice [pictures of orbitals](http://blogs.knoxnews.com/munger/2009/09/first-detailed-pics-of-single.html) (also [here](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829194.900-smile-hydrogen-atom-youre-on-quantum-camera.html)) these are the important picture resulting from \"strongly\" interacting with it. (That is, using electrons, lasers and big detector screens. Or very sharp tips of [quantum tunneling microscopes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope).) And these are tremendously important for chemistry and crystal structures and whatnot, but don't really let us know more about that grey region between high energy physics (atom smashers! particle jets! quark-gluon plasma! potential micro blackholes! [particle zoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_zoo)!) and the good old things we do with big bulky atoms.\n\nSo, the bound state of atoms-electrons are a mystery. Especially, that that QFT (quantum field theory) is very useful for explaining interactions, energy levels just come out for a lot of decimals, everything is dandy, but they can't really answer questions related to shapes and structures. It doesn't matter (ha-ha) for them, it's just field equations go in, field equations come out. And in a way, it's the right view of things, because if we don't observe, measure, detect, probe, prod, light it up with photons, then it might as well do anything, because ... how would we know? Maybe in the ground state an electron around an atom just sits and reads the news, goes to the loo, surfs the net, and as soon as it's showtime, it drops whatever it was doing and boom fields whizzing smashes into the incoming photon, gets excited and goes an energy level up.

If you have so many task's, But so little gnomad's doing them, They will take time do to them, They create these \"Mini-task-List's\" That basically what it does is, it takes there set job, it's priorities list, and looks around \"Hey, what am i gonna do, Oh! This, once this is done, then this!\". If you create a new task that takes priority over there current job's, they will do that job asap[They will finish what there doing then go do what you told them too]. \n\nIf you want a reference world that you can take a look at to see what a functional gnomad kingdom look's like/operates, you can take a look at my world [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i439q87tuvdnman/world08.sav). \nDon't trust my link? Grab the download from my other thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gnomoria/comments/2bemh7/legendary_bed_go/)\n\nIf your looking at my world, You can see i have multiple custom job's, A Multi-tinkerer that is mainly focused on tinkering, Then multi-smith's work on everything, Miners and woodworkers work on what they can aswell, then i got hauler's and dedicated warrior's, among other thing's, i balanced everyone in there own area's of workload, Can't have 10 guy's tinkering, take's too long and wastes too many resources that could be spended on various other things like moving my stone blocks into appropriate storage, or moving statuettes into the massive storage room etc etc. \n\nLast but not least, a tip: Remember this alway's, Gnomoria is a game that can't be rushed, except for food, rush food alway's, But everything else, Take your time. Treat your kingdom like a tree, Can't instantly grow tree's, take's time, Savor the moment, Think building house's is silly?

{"body": "As the person who originally suggested FAQ posts, I'm admittedly biased. But I definitely prefer FAQs to generic \"masterposts.\"  Here's why:\n\nI like to think I'm a bit knowledgeable about jazz. I've taken classes in it, played it on multiple instruments, and listened to a hell of a lot of it.\n\nIf you ask me a question like \"why do jazz musicians improvise while playing the melody of a tune?\" or \"what is 'playing outside' and how do I do it?\" or even the old chestnut \"what is the function of altered chords?\", I'll be able to give a pretty good, targeted answer with specific listening examples to back it up.\n\nOn the other hand, if you tell me \"write about jazz!\", I won't know where to begin. Do I give an introduction to chord-scale theory and improvisation? Do I give a history lesson? Do I talk about arranging for jazz band? \n\nIt's similar to how you can never think of what to say when someone says \"you know [piano/guitar/violin/didgeridoo] — play something!\" It doesn't matter if you've memorized the entire Real Book and ten different Beethoven sonatas; you won't know what single thing to play at that moment. But, if your friend says \"play me 'Have You Met Miss Jones'\", you'll be able to play that one tune beautifully.\n\n**HOWEVER**, I think that FAQs and masterposts can coexist, and fill different niches. FAQs are great, as I hinted at above, for specific, targeted answers to common questions. Masterposts could then be an additional thing, with different goals. They could even take on a user-Q&amp;A style, where you assemble the knowledgeable members of a specific subsection of members (guitarists, recording engineers, etc.), and let the community ask away.\n\nOf course, these are just my thoughts — y'all can do whatever you think is best!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406261515", "subreddit": "askmusicians", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Have you ever listened to any Black Moth Super Rainbow?? There older stuff is really heady and abstract and kind of hard to get into if it's not your style, but their most recent album, I think you may like a lot.\n\nBMSR - [Like a Sundae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkZQ_O0sml4)\n\nor [i think it is beautiful that you are 256 colors too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ6b5ghZZN0)\n\nor [Gangs in The Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggMY-FqNO70)\n\nAlso, one of the members of the band, Tobacco, is a pretty phenomenal psychedelic electronic artist in his own right. Here's a song off his new album called [father sister berzerker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3JbE7-q324).\n\nThe guy below me that suggested Tame Impala is right. They're fucking excellent, and if you're already interested in heavyish rock like Coheed, you may dig them. They can be pretty trippy and weird, but they can also get into some really killer heavy stompin rock too.\n\n\nTame Impala - [Elephant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0jqPvpn3sY)\n\nor [Mind Mischief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK_Er7WZVg)\n\n\nMy favorite band is The Flaming Lips, and they've been around for over 30 years, and every album has been pretty different, so it's hard to define their sound exactly. Just because they've had so many. They used to be very much a punk band, and it doesn't sound like that's really your thing, but in the last several years, they've gotten a lot heavier and gotten way more into electronics like synths and even making songs on iPad apps. Aside from being very musically talented, they are also one of the most lyrically powerfully bands I've ever heard, and once you start to get into their music and explore their songs a bit more, they can be very impacting and enlightening (I hope you don't think it's an affectation in order to seem deep, haha, they're very genuine guys).\n\n(the heavier stuff)\n\nThe Flaming Lips - [Worm Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNMCvys9IpU)\n\n(weirder electronicy stuff)\n\nThe Flaming Lips - [Is David Bowie Dying?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emW2aq3R8QE)\n\n(poppier, more lyrical stuff)\n\nThe Flaming Lips - [The Gold in the Mountains of Our Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZPJUrcBUi0)\n\nor [My Cosmic Autumn Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZBqsqvfj0Y)\n\n(and it almost wouldn't even be worth worth mentioning if you've never heard about their live show. Totally fucking insane. Every time.)\n\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YcevDXrJAw) was their Halloween show in 2012. The girl wasn't planned by them, haha. Their shows are so crazy that someone snuck in that bubble, painted themselves, and got into the thing naked just for the hell of it.\n\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlaKIyKyGIQ) one is just beautiful.\n\nMy next favorite is probably My Morning Jacket. Their singer is my spirit animal. They're, I think, the most solid band playing today. And their live shows are intense and mesmerizing. They actually used to be Bonnaroo's sort of \"house band\". They played the first 8 years straight. Can be really trippy, but can also be very classic rock sounding, can be incredibly melodic and just downright pretty. Jim James really sings like an angel, even live.\n\n[One Big Holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g1QXrXSiJI)\n\n[Wordless Chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptSqVZuvhGA)\n\n[Touch Me, I'm Going to Scream Pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5cJr7i3JP8)\n\n[Dondante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fRSvLF_QGw)\n\n\n\nIf you like any of this stuff, I could show you other stuff. If you don't like it, that's fine too, and I can show you different stuff, or not, if you're really just not feeling it at all. One thing that kinda bothers be is that it seems people have the impression that psychedelic rock is this antique music style that died in the seventies with that first generation of hippies, but it's very much still being made, and there are bands coming out every year that are arguable just as good as Jimi Hindrix or the Zombies or the Byrds or any of those old guys.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406354701", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n [**Folk religion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk%20religion): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;__Folk religion__, sometimes also termed __popular belief__, consists of [ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic) or regional [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) customs under the umbrella of a [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), but outside of official [doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine) and practices.  Folk religion has been defined as \"the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion.\" \n\n&gt;The term \"folk religion\" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects. The first is the religious dimension of [folk culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_culture), or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [syncretisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism) between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [Roman Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism) that led to the development of [Vodun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodun) and [Santería](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa), and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures. \n\n&gt;[Chinese folk religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion), Folk Christianity, Folk Hinduism, and Folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy) of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worship), do not belong to a [church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_body) or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith) in a particular [creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed), to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [baptised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism). \n\n&gt;Aspects of many, but not all, folk religions include:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* popular [theophanies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophany), and similar phenomena like [Marian apparitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_apparition), originating outside the formal liturgy and hierarchy of the faiths in question.\n\n&gt;* [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking)\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* protective qualities ascribed to religious objects like a particular copy of the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible), [Voodoo pouches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(African_American_culture\\)), a [crucifix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix), stones, crystals, [eagle feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_feather_law), or any other \"power\" object.\n\n&gt;* belief in traditional systems of [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal\\)) ([hoodoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(folk_magic\\)), [voodoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou), [pow-wow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pow-wow_(folk_magic\\)), [Benedicaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedicaria), [Palo Monte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Monte), [Anito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anito), [Santería](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa) and Catimbó)\n\n&gt;* [rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual) to ward off the [Evil Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_eye), [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse), [demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon), [witchcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft), etc.\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/YWEJUfh.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Botanica.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Chinese ^folk ^religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion) ^| [^Chinese ^folk ^religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion) ^| [^Vietnamese ^folk ^religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_folk_religion) ^| [^Ethnic ^religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_religion) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjcs8q2) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cjcs8q2)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406786663", "subreddit": "Smite", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
