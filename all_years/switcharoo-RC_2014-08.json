The glove's early successes were actually in increasing the core temperature of surgery patients recovering from anesthesia.\n\n&gt;\"We built a silly device, took it over to the recovery room and, lo and behold, it worked beyond our wildest imaginations,\" Heller explained. \"Whereas it was taking them hours to re-warm patients coming into the recovery room, we were doing it in eight, nine minutes.\"\n\n&gt;But the glove's effects on athletic performance didn't become apparent until the researchers began using the glove to cool a member of the lab – the confessed \"gym rat\" and frequent coauthor Vinh Cao – between sets of pull-ups. The glove seemed to nearly erase his muscle fatigue; after multiple rounds, cooling allowed him to do just as many pull-ups as he did the first time around. So the researchers started cooling him after every other set of pull-ups.\n\n&gt;\"Then in the next six weeks he went from doing 180 pull-ups total to over 620,\" said Heller. \"That was a rate of physical performance improvement that was just unprecedented.\"\n\nThat was published two years ago.

{"body": "Your camera gear is pretty good!! Decent lenses too, but with you guys being photographers that makes sense. Our company does both the video and photo too so its quite similar to what we use. Our main jobs are 2 videographers and one photographer. Having dedicated staff makes the day run much smoother in my opinion (Although sometimes we swap around) Love the 6Ds (for the price they are amazing and the low light shooting is almost on par with the 5dmkii)\n\nYeah decent tripods/sliders are a really good investment. I swear by them, really gives a much more professional feel to the videos. I use the Konova ones which I highly recommend.\n\nSteadicams/Glidecams are brilliant but need a lot of practice! We are hoping to invest in a Movi M5/M10 or cheaper equivalent. Check them out, they are awesome. But really expensive.\n\nWe use Sony Vegas too. It's the cheapest and most efficient option for us. We have 6 computers running off a server and edit all year round so although Macs would be nice we can't justify spending all the extra money when Vegas does everything we need. \n\nTip to get rid of the frame blending. When you're in the project, select all the video clips (not audio), right click, Switches, then Disable resample - That will get rid of that for you. Such a necessary tip that we only found by a lot of trial and error and searching forums. Basically takes away Vegas's automatic frame blending and makes the footage look much better, especially when you're watching on a big screen!\n\nYeah I understand about being cautious. First priority is always to capture the moments of the day. The creativity will come with time. Also try to frame shots similar to you would when shooting photos. In essence the theory is the same. A nicely composed video is the same as a nicely composed photo. Also, experiment, a lot!! There is no downside to practising shooting video just to brush up. Make short films or just generally shoot stuff. As a photographer I'm sure this is something you already are aware of!\n\nAlso a great investment for Vegas is Twixtor - gets you beautiful slow motion. Have a look at some videos on youtube and see what you think. \n\nAlso here's a couple of our showreels. We specialise in Asian weddings mainly but cater for everyone. (Which when we started was quite daunting since none of us really understood the cultures) Let me know what you think anyway\n\n\n[2012 showreel](http://youtu.be/bQ6QW9XU0vs)\n\n[2013 showreel](http://youtu.be/h6LIh2qrMV0)\n\n[Follow us on Facebook too](https://www.facebook.com/EliteFilming) and if you need any more advice/help feel free to message either on here or through the Facebook. My name's Kas by the way so if you do message just mention it's for me!\n\n\nAlways happy to help!!\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407234064", "subreddit": "videography", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This feels like middle school but [I like you too](http://i.imgur.com/mQa6JVE.jpg)\n\nFirst off I don't watch Winter. If I'm watching streamers I usually hope for  Incontrol / Minigun / Gemini / Jaedong (with cam) /  Demuslim (back in early HotS) etc.\n\nI can understand why you don't like Winter, but I don't really think that earns him a \"fuck winter\". \n\nHowever I can see the appeal of Winter to \"noobs\". He very clearly describes what he has scouted and how he is going to react (even if this is wrong). I remember being a little nooblet and I was certain the only reason I was loosing games was because I didn't know what was the correct response to what. Now obviously this Isn't the case, pretty much anyone diamond and up can make plat just building marines and medivacs but once again this isn't really the point. \n\nI feel he has built a following of people who want to learn, but also want to interact. Also Winter out performs many of these high masters people that get ~ 50 viewers in terms of hours streamed. That along with catering to all races (random) makes me thing he could be a legitimate entry level streamer. \n\nIn terms of the viewbotting... I don't really know how anyone can know for certain what is going on there. If you go on twitch and winter is 3k+ in viewership does this mean he is being botted? IDK, I don't really know how anyone can tell for certain except for twitch. If winter has got him self to where he is with botting then I agree, fuck winter. But how can we know for sure? \n\nDestiny this weekend had 10k viewers in bots at one point (in groups) for sure.

{"body": "I think the first thing to do would be to pick a section of land to put them on. My first choice was Australia, but I'm not sure if it's large enough to house the population.\n\nWolfram Alpha says the population of the world in 1800 was 959 million people. The current population of the Americas is 974 million people. So I'd pick the Americas, I'm not completely certain that it would be able to hold up a population that large, but, meh.\n\nThe next step would be to make sure that the people can't cross to other continents or landmasses, this makes it so that the government doesn't have to clean up the technology off of any of the other continents. This requires picking a point in time before sailing the open seas was possible.\n\nChoosing a point in time is difficult. The further back you go the less technology they'll have, the more disease there'll be, the harder it'll be for a large population to be sustained. I don't actually know much of anything about the history of the Americas before Europe arrived on the scene. A weird issue is that the people won't all be of one ethnicity so it won't match the historical setting well, and I don't really think you could just change people's culture to match what was around back then without mind altering virtually magic brainstorming techniques. And even then, people's ethnicities would not be the same, unless you can somehow change their ethnicities this version of the past won't be a thorough recreation, and it's likely that cultures will develop differently even if you do use brainwashing initially to get them into the cultures from back then, the differences in their appearances would be odd to them and people will likely find it natural to group up by their appearances over time, etc.\n\nMoving on from that, the issue of removing signs of technology is also really hard. You *could* maaybe go around the whole place trying to find every sign of technology and cleaning it up. But there would always be the chance that you'd fail, and it would be very difficult and expensive to do. I'd think the best thing to do would be to cover the whole continent in a thick layer of dirt (possibly after removing some things that wouldn't really be covered by this like skyscrapers.) People might eventually discover things though if they just happen to dig in the wrong place. It depends on how confidant they are they could find every beer bottle, railroad track, plastic bottle, etc. If they think they could remove everything by hand or with technology then that would be the better approach. If they have nanotechnology they might use some sort of controlled [Grey Goo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo) to clean the technology up by eating it.\n\nI'm not sure what you could do to prevent people from recording a history of what happened. If you wait a few generations (until all the people who actually experienced what happened is dead) you could try inserting denial propaganda that tells some other story about the past and convincing people that way. Or, hey, what you could do. You could store all the people in some other place, then what you could do is when those people have children just take their children and take the *children* to the Americas, then have like agents of yours raise the children in the Americas. It'll be hard to do, you'll have to take some adults from the population of the people to take care of the children before they're old enough.\n\nThis stealing children idea and transplanting them to America idea is the only way I can think of that makes sense. I'm not sure if traditional forms of brainwashing would be able to brainwash people into not talking about technology, but if they never know about technology then there you are! There might be some secret holdouts among the descendants of the adults or something, but if they announced their knowledge publicly the government could just kill them and cover stuff up. Plus this might also solve the ethnicity issue, if you forcibly pair people to create the children in the first place then you *might* be able to make a more or less racially homogeneous version of each of the traditional cultures from whatever time period is chosen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407743276", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This was my submission for the past “The Downfall” contest and the one that game me wings. \n\n**A comic six~~ty five million years~~ months in the making.**\n\nI admit it, I wished to make a Nepal comic ever since I read the [tutorial](http://i.imgur.com/2W1zu2U.png#shelf-tutorial). I found the reason it has such a bizarre shape is because it used to be two triangular pennants that were flown together before they got fused in one “flag”. And what’s more, before colonialism all of India used to have countries with triangular and other non-rectangular flags, some of which had already [been drawn  as “monsters” in the sub](http://i.imgur.com/KmPCZoX.png).\n\nSo back in January, I had an idea for a comic where Britain would go into the Indian jungle, great white hunter style, and kill all the monster flags except Nepal. I drew  a [Mughalmonster](http://i.imgur.com/2BMmlAW.png) that could have come out of a Resident Evil game, after a [flag](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Flag_of_the_Mughal_Empire.svg) in Wikipedia, and even came up with the idea that [Oudh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oudh_State) would go around barking its name Pokémon-style. But when I tried to draw the first panel I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t draw backgrounds in Paint and the panels I had in mind were far too ambitious, with too many characters. I wanted to use [Princely State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state) balls as Britain’s servants but I realized I knew nothing about them and could not give them a personality. At that point, I should have read these wise words from [DickRhino](http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/wiki/index/honours/hussar_wings) (from whom I later stole the ‘[arooooo](http://i.imgur.com/iVVH05D.png)’ cry)…\n\n&gt;Storyboard the entire thing beforehand, either just in your head or on paper. Then, when you have the entire structure laid out, it will be too long. It always is. So when you've reached that point, ask yourself: \"what can I cut?\" Then proceed to cut, cut and cut some more, until you cannot take anything more out without hurting the story. That's when you've hit the spot.\n\n…but I didn’t. I abandoned that comic. Interestingly, in July fellow Spaniard /u/tian-shi came with [a similar idea](http://i.imgur.com/2BNKuRs.png) for the “Mythical Ethnogenesis” contest and got his wings. I was buried with a big final exam at the time so I didn’t enter the contest and only checked the entries once. Maybe I forgot it, maybe I didn’t check again when the contest finished, but I had no recollection that tian-shi had won or that that comic was his, ***at all***. I just got that there was a way to make Nepal monster comics and make them funny.\n\n(cont.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407968160", "subreddit": "polandball", "score": 203, "controversiality": 0}

The best I can come up with is: 'colonies,' a concept that really doesn't hold weight between the Roman Empire and the European colonial age.\n\nIf you were a woman, or young male child and stood to inherit some politically-explosive title, you got sent to a monastery, preferably far from your supporters or estates. Taking vows nullified your claims and kept you far from court. Ideally, children who were oblated would never learn of their potential inheritance, or would be indoctrinated enough as brothers/sisters that it wouldn't matter when they reached majority.\n\nIf you were male and (close enough to) adult, then you got exiled (with very disparate results), or the Pope excommunicated you and declared your lands up-for-grabs, unless you paid up or won your title back.\n\nThe history of Britain is littered with exiled lords and families, banned from taking part in the politics of their country, and threatened with death should they return. Some did (Henry Bolingbroke), some didn't (James II Stuart -thru- Charles Edward Stuart).\n\nThere isn't an 'exile through service' option in medieval European (or at least British) history, simply because of the adjacency and distance between European monarchies. If you got stripped of your titles and lands, you went next door, and got a rival king to back you, because there was nowhere else to go. (I am sorely lacking in knowledge of Russian history, which is probably where you'd find the closest thing to a frontier in Europe. If anyone has suggestions for introductory books on Russian history [preferably popular, but scholarly is good too] I'm welcome to ideas)\n\n**TL;DR - The idea of the Night's Watch, as a 'release valve' of inconvenient, militant, Westerosi nobility, doesn't seem to have a real-world equivalent.

That seems incorrect to me, but maybe you disagree?\n\nAdditionally, his assertion that there are no fingerprints of AGW is incorrect. We can measure isotopic variation in CO2 concentration and see that the increase in CO2 is human caused.\n\nHis belief that nothing can be proven in science relies on a very narrow definition of \"science\" and \"proof\", specific to evidence which relies on statistical probability (which, yes, does include much of climate science, but not *all* of science) Have we not proven that the Earth is spherical, that HIV causes AIDS, that the speed of light in a vacuum is 3^8 m/s, that humans evolved from common ancestors with other animals?\n\nSpencer would actually refute that last point, as [he denies evolution, too](http://theevolutioncrisis.org.uk/testimony2.php):\n&gt;Observation of malaria, E. coli and HIV, all of which exist in vast numbers and have short life cycles, have shown that while 'Darwinian' processes can cause minor changes, always involving a loss of complexity, they cannot build complexity – nor can they begin to explain where the proteins and genes came from in the first place. Again, the Bible has said all along that life was originally created and has ever since reproduced 'after its kind'.\n\nGiven that neither of us are familiar enough with Spencer's work to judge the results for ourselves, bringing up the fact that he holds many irrational, faith-based beliefs is not an *ad hominem*. He presents himself as a scientists and an expert, so revealing his many unscientific beliefs is good evidence that he's likely engaging in the same faith-based approach to climate science. He is not a trusted source of accurate science. Is this really someone you want to prop up as your expert scientist on climate change? Unlike Hayhoe, who can square her faith with scientific fact, Spencer just denies what doesn't fit with his theological ideology.
