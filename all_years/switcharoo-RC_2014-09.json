Each hazard line and space is [9 m](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223667/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-05.pdf). So the bike was 45m away when the car pulled out.\n&gt; \n&gt; 45 m at 97 mph takes [1.04 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45+m+at+97mph).\n&gt; \n&gt; 45 m at 60 mph (the speed limit on a de-restricted single carriageway) takes [1.68 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45+m+at+60mph).\n&gt; \n&gt; 45 m at 50 mph (about half the speed he was doing) takes [2.01 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45+m+at+50mph).\n&gt; \n&gt; So the bike's excessive speed means he arrived 0.64 seconds sooner than he otherwise would if he'd been doing the speed limit, or 0.97 seconds sooner than if he'd been going at around half the speed. Look at how far across the junction the car was when the bike hit it. Would it have completely cleared the lane with a safe gap less than a second later? I don't think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the car couldn't have to got out of the way in time. Could the bike have stopped in time?\n&gt; \n&gt; The braking distance at 60 mph is [73 m](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312249/the-highway-code-typical-stopping-distances.pdf). The bike was closer than this when the car started to pull out.\n&gt; \n&gt; The stopping distance at 50 mph is [53 m](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312249/the-highway-code-typical-stopping-distances.pdf). The bike was closer than this when the car started to pull out.\n&gt; \n&gt; So even at half the speed the bike would likely still have hit the car. He'd probably have lived, but the car put him in a position where he had to take evasive action.\n&gt; \n&gt; So can we please stop with the \"it was the biker's fault for going too fast\" bullshit now? The car driver caused the accident, the biker made it fatal.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409922065", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thanks mulpacha!\n\nRegarding the lack of a display, my \"pitch\" is that the device would act as a second signer for a multisig address on your phone (or computer).  So you'd see the transaction before you tap your tag to produce the second signature.  I suppose your wallet app could \"go rogue\" [and there are some potential solutions here too], but, like you pointed out, it requires a more sophisticated attack since one of the keys are permanently offline.\n\nFor brevity, I kept the video as simple as possible.  But through the NFC APDU interface, users can load their own private keys, set passwords, require cryptographic authentication from the wallet app (check an ECDSA signature), lock the \"spend address\", set per \"tap\" or daily spend limits (this requires the optional battery), etc.  I discuss this in more detail in the white paper. \n\nThe challenge though is coming up with a simple \"pitch\" for how this could very easily be integrated with the popular wallets.  What's the simplest but still useful realization of this technology?  \n\nMy answer is \"a second signer\" for a multisig wallet.  Integrating this into existing apps should not be too difficult:\n\n- To initially create the multisig address, the app would request the user tap his tag to the phone and the app would read the pubkey (which it would then use together with one of its own keys to create a P2SH multisig address).\n\n- To transfer funds from the multisig address, upon user acknowledgement the wallet app would sign the TX, and then pass the TX to the sigSafe to get the second signature.  The user \"taps\" his tag to sign.\n\nThere's *lots* of additional cool things you could do later to improve both useability and security, but I think it's nice to start out with something very simple. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410112184", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've been here a few weeks now and here are some things that I like.\nThe [Makapu'u lighthouse point trail](http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/hiking/oahu/index.cfm?hike_id=23) is a fairly easy hike that offers great views. You can see Rabbit Island and into the mountains. It's best to go on a slightly cloudy day, because the sun gets pretty hot, although when I went there was a really nice breeze, so it wasn't too bad. It took about 2 hours or so in total. Diamond Head is supposed to be a very hot hike, so I'm planning on going a little later in the year, but from what I've seen the view over Waikiki really can't be beat.\n\nI hear [Hanauma Bay](http://www.hanauma-bay-hawaii.com/) is really nice for snorkeling. \n\n[The Aloha Tower](http://www.alohatower.com/) is a free attraction that offers decent views of the city. It's too bad the marketplace there is shut down, it looks like it was a pretty fun place. Chinatown is nearby as well, if you want to check it out and/or grab a plate of rice/noodles.\n\nThere's a [groupon](https://www.groupon.com/deals/maita-i-catamaran) for a half price 90 minute cruise on Maita'i Catamaran, which is a lot of fun and lets you see the island and the mountains from the ocean. It goes around Diamond Head and you can see Koko Head too. Also, be sure to check out the narrow sidewalk above the sea wall in front of the Sheraton near where they board. When the big waves come in, they splash way high up, it's pretty cool, but the best part is that there are huge sea turtles feeding near the wall and you can watch them (I've went by there around 4-ish in the afternoon and they've been there every time).\n\n[The Honolulu Zoo](http://www.honoluluzoo.org/default.htm) is fairly small and not all that expensive ($12). It's a nice park atmosphere to walk around, but if it's hot out, then the animals might not be so active. I like the giraffes and they also have the biggest pelican I've ever seen.\n\n[Pearl Harbor](https://www.pearlharboroahu.com/) is one of those historic places that you should probably visit. I haven't made it over there yet, but I'm planning on it. As I understand, there are actually 4 museums/ships in the area that you can visit. [The Polynesian Cultural Center](http://www.polynesia.com/) on the other side of the island is supposed to be really good, but I haven't made it there yet.  \n\nThe mountains behind the [Kualoa Ranch](http://www.kualoa.com/) are  simply spectacular.\n\nAnother place that I liked was the [Byodo-In Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byodo-In_Temple). It's a small little area, but it's only $3. \n\nThe [Foster Botanical Garden](http://www.honolulu.gov/cms-dpr-menu/site-dpr-sitearticles/568-foster-botanical-garden.html) has some huge trees and is a nice place to walk around. Although it's somewhat on the small side it's a nice place to relax. \n\nThe best place I've eaten so far probably has been [Simply Joy](http://www.simplejoyhawaii.com/). \n\nI'll be able to tell you more in the upcoming weeks as I see/do more things here.\n\nUPDATE:\n\n[Punchbowl Crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchbowl_Crater) has really amazing views of all of Honolulu and it's free to go up there.\n\nThe [Pali Lookout](http://www.gohawaii.com/oahu/regions-neighborhoods/windward-oahu/nuuanu-pali-lookout) has great views of the other side of the island from up in the mountains.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410251767", "subreddit": "Oahu", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Socio, psycho, whatever, she's jerking people around for fun, the definition of a sociopath. Even if her motives *were* to protect herself from A, it would have been much *more* normal to just tell the truth and do her time.\n\nI've played with the idea of her being raped as a child, or seeing her sister killed (Halloween story she told), and so forth, but ONE sign of a socio is having **nobody** to tell the truth to. She had four close friends, and didn't hint that she was getting \"A messages\". *Then* she supposedly had to \"rule them out\" of being A (and these are her *friends*), meaning she'd made ***lots*** of people mad enough to want to kill her, and yet not one time did she mention to her four friends that she was distressed about ~anything.\n\nMaybe the four friends should have known, but we're talking 12-14 year olds (pre-disappearance) whose own problems were *made worse* by Ali (like, Ali wanting Spencer to tell Melissa about kissing all her boyfriends), so I'm not blaming the Liars at all (except maybe for *remaining* her friends, because OMG). Move to the adults, and mark through Jessica because she's cray-cray: maybe Byron should have said \"Ali is blackmailing me\" --there's some responsibility he dropped that could have saved the world a bunch of trouble. And Peter might have said, \"You might not want to have a sexual relationship with Jason because [fill in excuse so they won't hook up with their *brother*]\". Veronica might have insisted on MOVING (I still don't get that mess).\n\nBut this is a show where the cops are all bad and the girls can wear spikes to school. In this context, fake-stuffing a ballot box for Spencer is \"ooh, this friend (Ali) is a tad too controlling.\" **But drugging the girls to rule them out as her \"tormentor\", because so many people hated her they formed GROUPS to get rid of her? No: Ali's full-on psycho.** She may have nature/nurture reasons for it, but at 18 now, still dragging her friends into lies that *hurt* the friends and help *her*, she needs to be locked up at a real psycho ward (not Radley).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410365360", "subreddit": "PrettyLittleLiars", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[](/flutterfear) Last time I forgot to mention Hurricane Fluttershy made me use my first [pony wallpaper](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-Wallpaper-294524018).\n[](/sp)\n[](/rarityjudge) My issue with Ponyville Confidential is that it really needed a second moral. The way adult ponies responded to Gabby Gums really encouraged them, and while their fault may be obvious to the audience, I felt that at least Rarity should've apologized for setting a bad example.\n[](/sp)\n[](/ajlie) Applejack was actually meant to be guilty as well, but that got cut for time.\n[](/sp)\n[](/cadancesmile)And here we go for the extravagant, action-packed, [most heavily promoted](http://ponybot.net/pix/2522.jpg) special yet. This came soon after the real royal wedding, and (at least from what I remember, being very light on spoilers back then) they made sure to only showcase Cadance as a nice, pretty pink princess which everybody claimed would be the doom of the franchise, born from pure corporate greed meddling with Faust's vision. At most we saw the army of mane6 clones, which made people expect shenanigans with the mane6 cloning themselves to help prepare the wedding. How could this not be a horribly girly pretty pink pony princess wedding made solely to sell a toy set?\n\nWell, fake Cadance's attitude immediately surprised me, and I was also thrown off when Shining Armor defended her near the end. That was an amazing cliffhanger to be followed by happy credits music.\n\n[](/rdsmile)[Twilight didn't have her cutie mark during the flashback](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120428204435/mlp/images/4/49/Young_Cadance_with_filly_Twilight_S2E25.png), so she wasn't Celestia's student yet. Makes you wonder what would make her go foalsitting, huh. I have my canonheads.  \n[Also, this thingy came up a month before the episode, so that was really sweet to see.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt2IVcrVkdc)\n[](/sp)\nThe real Cadance was pretty weak in her imprisonment, and we don't know how much she did try to escape, or whether she can teleport. We saw they had to teleport to the exit, and [we've seen Twilight can do group teleportation](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120319081358/mlp/images/4/46/Twilight_Rainbow_Rarity_Spike_escaped_S2E21.png).\n\n[](/happyluna)I love how the epic villain song stands out among epic villain songs by being a duet between the villain and victim. Also, that singing voice.\n[](/sp)\n[](/lunasad) And give Luna a break, [poor mare has a night shift after all.](http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/art/Princess-Luna-is-sleeping-angel-297747618)\n[](/sp)\n[Ancient alicorn laser beams were pretty cool too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfLQHW3_qVw). That was like Dumbledore VS Voldemort back then.\n\nAs you said, I also think this is intended to be a departure, and as a result the climax is kinda clunky and the mane6 don't have a big role, but I don't think that should diminish its merits.  \nWe've seen the elements being used twice and their use being challenged. The characters now jumped to them as the solution, just as people fear (\"oh look they're just going to solve everything with their deus exlements again\"), but instead we got something else. I think they introduced Love's magic power as an alternative to Friendship, and the way Shining Armor and Cadance are able to use it is much different from the changelings'.\n\nUnlike the elements, this ending might actually be a deus ex machina. A lot of people forget that [a deus ex has to come from nowhere](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina), which the elements never do, but this kinda does.  \nEven if it is a deus ex, I don't find it bad. For one, [it's beautifully done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ViDPWCcwmg), and it's a departure from the elements being the only way to solve things.\n\n[](/rdj)[And this episode made me decide to have a pony music playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1eVYL04dLQ)\n[](/sp)\nAlthough it had its haters, [people were blown away by this episode back then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY0lPWmKyXY). It actually had a complex plot unlike the previous two-parters (which you mentioned in Return of Harmony), and it achieved quite an emotional story. Changelings are awesomely designed, too, [so we got this the next day](http://web.archive.org/web/20120425072527/http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/drawfriend-stuff-402-chrysalis-edition.html) (time-machined to prevent spoilers and for additional time travelling effects).\n\n[](/rdannoyed)Nowadays I see a lot of people saying it's better if you don't think about it, which I disagree with. Sure it's an emotional episode and that works well if you just go along with it, but I don't think it has nearly as many plotholes and problems as people often say.\n[](/sp)\n[](/gross)One common complaint is, as you indicated, the introduction of these two never-before-mentioned characters. We knew about it when the synopsis came out like six weeks before the episode, so it didn't surprise me in the episode, but the same goes for others who still hate that, so I guess that's irrelevant.\n\nHowever, if anything, that's a problem with the _season_ not introducing these characters beforehand, not the episode. Like you, I also think they were introduced pretty damn well for the purposes of the story.\n[](/rppseesyou)[^(And I love this PMV, but psst, it's hidden. I found it somewhathow.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owM4HJYLWIY)\n[](/sp)\n[](/chrysalis)Another major complaint is that Chrysalis' plan made no sense, but it does to me, and it's pretty good. She wanted to weaken the military's strongest defence, so she infiltrated herself, which is quite ballsy. She didn't intend to be caught and fight Celestia since she thought she was too weak, so it's safe to assume she wanted to backstab Celestia while the army was invading. Her monologuing about her plan was in fact buying time while her army hit the shield.\n\nAs for her acting mean in disguise, I take it as her personality coming through and abusing her position of power, while enjoying how nobody calls her out. When she did get called out, we saw her put a very believable act, AND we saw that she had mind-controlled Shining Armor to defend her in such a case. So she had \"wedding stress\" as an excuse all along.\n\nExtra random stuff:  \n[Be Prepared (Chrysalis ver.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cI4aAAdEV0)  \n[Alternate ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-1dyaFyDLk)  \n[Changeling fics are awesome](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/38135/who-we-are)\n\n[](/sp)\n\n[](/fluttershy)I guess now you can check [my list of season 2 episode threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/2e7iw5/indis_mlp_exploration_part_11_the_mysterious/cjxcoqi).  \nYou know, if you want. ^It's ^not ^like ^^I ^^spent ^^so ^^much ^^^time ^^^on ^^^it....\n[](/sp)\n[](/applegasp) Holy horseapples, it's 4 AM.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411541024", "subreddit": "mylittlepony", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
