{"body": "This is great advice -- I've been involved in post (mostly music, some sound design) for years now, and this seems spot on. Specifically: the technical aspects of using Pro Tools will likely come easily enough to you, as you're well-versed in FCP. The potential issues will come from learning about sound itself, and how to shape/improve your raw material into something polished-sounding.\n\nIf you're dead set on doing this yourself, then it definitely couldn't hurt to take a class on sound, whether at a local community college or somewhere affordable. There's obviously lots of material online -- I like the video tutorials at macprovideo -- no, I am not affiliated with them -- but I think they have a couple on sound and post, and it might be worth spending the $25 or whatever to see what you'll be getting yourself into.\n\nAnd yes, the \"difficulty level\" will also depend on the nature of the film. If most of the film takes place in only a couple of well-controlled environments with relatively little sound design &amp; effects, then you'll have an easier go of it than if there's a ton of explosions and poorly-recorded dialogue and weird room tones and stuff you need to navigate. You might also consider the fact that established sound designers tend to have large libraries of effects to cull from -- you will have to start the hunt on your own, or create things from scratch. So factor that in.\n\nThere are so many aspects to post sound, that it might be worth it to figure out the couple of aspects that would be considerably more difficult/impossible for you, and hire someone to just do that subset of the duties -- and then you can try your hand at the rest.\n\nEDIT: Here are some links to some online classes that might be worth taking a look at. There are some free sample lessons, but you have to pay for the more in-depth lessons. While I haven't taken these exact classes, I've had a great deal of success with many of the others on this site -- almost all great and helpful on some level. I'd suggest watching the samples and reading the outlines to see if it's worthwhile for you.\n\n[Audio Concepts at macprovideo](http://www.macprovideo.com/tutorials/audioconcepts-topic)\n\n[Lots of Pro Tools courses here, too](http://www.macprovideo.com/tutorials/ProTools-application)\n\n[Dialogue Editing](http://www.macprovideo.com/tutorial/pro-tools-302-dialog-editing-for-film-tv)\n\nThere are obviously a ton of these types of things out there, but fwiw I've had good luck with this bunch (for other applications/concepts)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412276548", "subreddit": "AudioPost", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

The reason it looks like a wing is to be more aerodynamic when traveling at speeds of near 50mph(!!) \n\nAll of the force required to lift the hulls from the water is generated on the foils, which are like miniature wings that provide lift under the water. To put this in perspective, a combined lifting surface area (both rudders and leeward foil) amount to about 10 square feet (ish). That small surface is lifting an 8 ton boat. Holy crap. \n\nAside from that, these boats are truly the most cutting edge sailboats ever built, except for the most recent iteration of the vestas sail rocket. The raw materials cost for one boat is around the 10-20 million mark, but the development and testing budget amounted to more than 200 million. \n\n(I'm on mobile ATM and will provide some cool links and relevant info when I get to my computer.)\n\nEDIT:\n\n[ETNZ foiling fast as fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNb5QJH1vtE)\n\n[OTUSA capsize and death of Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drgglIebuQY)\nEDIT: Andrew Simpson died in an Artemis Racing accident.

{"body": "Dear sir, \n\nI think you are highly intelligent (sarcasm not included). That's not the problem here. The problem isn't how smart you are. The problem is how you ignore what is actually happening the real world. You're stuck in book world where you learned all this \"stuff\" from and then act as if it can apply to the real world that the rest live in...the university mentality kills creativity and thinking.  Evident by your application of who drains taxes by using emergency rooms. Under the assumption the uninsured are citizens and not understanding that it's mainly illegals. \n\nThe problem is that the fact that illegals are a tax drain goes against your \"feelings\" of how they should be treated. This has created a weird double standard that you don't care to correct. \n\n&gt;What, you insisting that things were true because you imagined them to be, and refusing to change your mind when presented with any evidence to the contrary?\n\nI'm sorry, what are you talking about? I gave evidence to every single thing I've offered. YOU, however, have not. \n\nSo don't put that in your pipe and smoke, because that's probably why you can't seem to grasp how you are who you can't stand in this conversation, since you're the one doing everything you're accusing me of.\n\nGovernment is not needed in our lives as is. Or why would the creation of this country and the branches of government be done in order to create a system that would gridlock any creation of new laws? That's why each are equal in power, none is more powerful than the other. There was supposed to be gridlock. There was supposed to be NOTHING done. Why have another kingdom? As you want it that's exactly what it would be called. \n\nI'm glad when you said Government's useful that you listed why. Well done using feelings and I THINK again. \n\nYes, because when President Bush was in office the left was so pleased with all he did and never, ever complained. \n\nPresident Obama is self centered douchebag. Evident by his speeches. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I BLAME BLAME BLAME BLAME BLAME BLAME I I I I I I I I I BLAME BLAME BLAME I I I I I I I I I I I I \n\nReform is a stupid term used to try to indicate the \"right\" direction when it is in no way synonymous with such. \n\nInsurance companies are a business. They are not a care facility. I'm sorry you don't get that, but that makes a HUGE difference in how they're ran. Same with the Government. \n\nWhich is why neither are necessary in all aspects of life and the former is never necessary in any aspect of life. \n\nI don't care if it was right, left, up or down, any form of health care is stupid when it's a tax and then takes from the good to give to the stupid. \n\nYes it does. \n\nAnd now to prove you wrong. \n\n[Bankrupt hospitals](http://www.managedcaremag.com/content/bankrupt-hospitals-england-turn-private-sector)\n\n[Fat costs a lot](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/obesity-bankrupt-nhs-warning)\n\n[the old cost a lot, too](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10387187/NHS-faces-bankruptcy-over-ageing-population.html)\n\n[Doctors are controlled by government more than their own knowledge](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2661970/Death-bureaucracy-As-learn-NHS-bankrupt-read-excoriating-attack-managers-senior-consultant.html)\n\n[Crazy people cost a lot](http://www.oecd.org/health/uk-needs-to-tackle-high-cost-of-mental-ill-health.htm)\n\nHigh costs with not a lot of good turn out is pretty sad. Considering you claimed government involvement makes things better. Over there it has made things worse and Doctors don't like being doctors. Great job in backing a terrible idea. \n\nNot to mention in the UK they use ambulances as taxis. Oh, drunk? Call an ambulance, they can't say no. What a great use of medical transportation.\n\n[Canada ranked last....](http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canada-ranked-last-among-oecd-countries-in-health-care-wait-times-1.1647061)\n\nI believe individuals have the best knowledge on how to handle their own lives and that they should be able to do so in all aspects of their life. \n\nGovernment need not be involved. \n\nYou know what would happen if this were actually true? Gay marriage would be okay. But because Government entangles itself in everything, this has made what liberals claim to care about an actual issue when it never should've been. \n\nLess government, more freedom for those that claim to want it, but you really don't want that. You are part of that liars club that want to control people and their choices. You are the problem, not me.\n\nBye, Troll who didn't provide any evidence for his feelings.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413053852", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you are just starting with shrimp, I highly highly highly recommend a Neocaridinia variety. Hardy and easy to breed. And if your LFS sells shrimp, wonderful, but there is not a single LFS in my decently sized city that has shrimp as varied, healthy, and cheap as I can get from breeders online. PlantedTank.net in particular has tons of people selling great shrimp.  \n\nThe 3 most common types of blue neos (at the moment, who knows what will be popular 6 months from now) are Blue Velvets, Blue Diamond, and Blue Dream. Blue Velvets are the cheapest and most common. Usually around $3 a shrimp. They have a light almost sky blue coloration, and are very transparent. [They look pretty cool with eggs too](http://imgur.com/cTVQFzo). Blue Diamonds have been crazy popular in the last year or so. [Here](http://imgur.com/Np5OebD) is a picture of one of Speedie's. BDs can be the darkest of the blues, though this is a truly spectacular specimen. The problem with BDs is that they don't breed true. So from a BD mother you'll get a bunch of BDs combined with light blues, browns, maroons, and maybe some blacks. BDs run anywhere from 5 for normal to 8 or 9 for ones like the ones Speedie sells. [Blue Dreams](http://imgur.com/fVlbMlu) are actually just very dark Blue Velvets. The blue has been bred darker and darker. They are a little newer on the block, I have really only seen them sold for not insane prices in the last 6 months or so. Still pricey though.  \n\nThere are tons of varieties other than these, but I'd say these 3 plus say Carbon Rilis are the easiest blue shrimp to get your hands on these days.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413491841", "subreddit": "shrimptank", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

What are you talking about, bp?\n\n&gt;Her perception of you = her sexual desire for you \n\nThis is some job interview shit right here.  \"Do I wear my wedding band?

Where is the fucking misogyny you keep telling us about?  Where is the generalizing statement that will be taken seriously by 70,000 users because I can't fucking see it.\n\n&gt;Self-professed ugly girl on TwoX complains about her experience at the club--she was basically treated like a man.\n\nHaha! Women can't know whether they are ugly or not.  We have to tell her in order for it to be true!  Now she knows how WE feel!  Let the hate flow through youuuuuuuu.\n\n&gt;Scientific evidence supports Red Pill Theory \n\nI doubt that.  \n\n&gt;Guy's wife gets drunk at a friend's house and is \"raped\" by her friend's husband. Suddenly there's a wedding and it's all cool again.\n\nDo you see this knowledge of psychology and societal tropes?  The guy who posts this clearly knows things.  He knows the things.  Listen to that guy.  He gets to define what rape is.  Vote whoever the fuck posted that into office.  He'll be a real go-getter.\n\n&gt;Guide to Avoiding Emotional Tampon\n\nMen don't use emotions.  Emotions are feminine.  Feminine is bad.  Women are bad.\n\n&gt;Women are Manipulative and Concerned Only with Their Immediate Interests \n\nOh my God the irony.  That's literally what red pill is all about.  Getting sex ASAP.\n\n&gt;Let's not blame the disney fantasy for the widespread beta disease. There is much redpill truth within these animated films.\n\nLike Mulan whereby women should be assigned husbands.  Like Beauty and the Beast whereby it's OK to hold women hostage until they love you.  It's been done in history guys, so it works!\n\n&gt;Hillary 2016: why all men should be concerned\n\nPoliticians:  Why all people should be concerned.  But no really guys, I just CAN'T SEE THE MISOGYNY!\n\n&gt;In response to the \"ugly women\" article\n\nThis ought not to be misogynistic.\n\n&gt;Help me stop hating women and start attracting them.\n\nOh my God it's finally a breath of fresh air.  OK I'm good.  Hold my beer, I'm going in deeper.\n\n&gt;How can older guys make most out of their SMV in college town USA? (spinning plates, getting laid, etc.)\n\nIt's easy!  Just lie and manipulate them!  \n\nOK I can't do this anymore.
