{"body": "January might be a little late in the season to start looking for work in Sydney, especially because most backpackers tend to arrive at the end of December or a bit earlier. I got to Sydney at the beginning of February this year and couldn't find work in my field or out of it (except for Domino's Pizza and that one Amnesty International fundraising gig I did for a week that's totally not worth it).  Some backpackers get to Sydney and find tons of opportunities and others find nothing.\n\nAs soon as you get off the plane, get a SIM card and activate an Aussie number (I'd stick with Optus, since Telstra's a bit expensive for most backpackers).  Try [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com.au/) or [Seek](http://www.seek.com.au) for finding work (I've found loads of legit jobs on Gumtree) and make sure you have your [TFN](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/tax-file-number/) as soon as possible, otherwise you won't be able to get paid.\n\nIf you're still looking for a hostel, I cannot more highly recommend the [Blue Parrot Backpackers](http://www.blueparrot.com.au) in Potts Point; yeah, it's not the cheapest, but I have met some of the most amazing people at that hostel over the two weeks I stayed there the first time and again the second time as well. I think it was rated by a bunch of websites as like the third best hostel in all of Australia and New Zealand, and it is 150% worth it.\n\nIf you're staying in Sydney for a while, be sure to hit up Bondi Beach (of course) and definitely do the walk from Bondi to Coogee beaches (free, takes about 45 minutes); I'm sure you can wrangle a few friends from the hostel.  Also check out Newtown, [the Blue Mountains](http://www.bluemts.com.au), and the Royal Botanic Gardens (which are all free as well). If you stay at the Blue Parrot, they can hook you up with a free walking tour of the city that allows you to check out a ton of sights and learn a lot about Sydney's history.  As for food, every time I go back to Sydney now I have to go to [Harry's Café de Wheels in Wooloomooloo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry's_Cafe_de_Wheels) (near the Botanic Gardens) as they have the BEST pies in all of Australia (and yes, I've had a lot of pies over the last year).\n\nHope you enjoy your Australian holiday, and feel free to PM me if you have any questions about Sydney or backpacking the rest of Oz! :)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415368926", "subreddit": "solotravel", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

You never played rogue on nightmare though, and you're obviously bad at the game, so any objection you have doesn't really have any merit because your opinion comes out of assumptions, and not experience.\n\n&gt; Also we need a third party to judge since you could just make up numbers for each class. Since we don't have a third party who even gives a rats sht about this thread, you will never have your \"facts\" correctly proven.\n\nUnfortunately for you, 1 person in this thread [calls rogue ridiculously OP, says he facerolls nightmare too](http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/2ltl61/i_found_dragon_age_2_much_more_enjoyable_than/cly3zeh). You can, of course, play the poor subjectivity card again, but you have to prove it's not objectively OP, it's not up to us to prove it's not subjective.

{"body": "**Baltimore: Witch of Harju** is another fantastic entry in the ongoing saga. Peter Bergting takes over the drawing duties from Stenbeck and is a very good fill in. He captures the same feel and is close to the same look. [He can compose a really cool panel, too](http://m.imgur.com/a/xtSV9). He doesn't blow me away like Stenbeck can, but I wouldn't mind seeing him pop up in the Mignolaverse again. ..and he very well may be back soon since Stenbeck is leaving for Frankenstein Underground, which looks awesome. ** The Wolf and the Apostle #1** begins his last arc. Unlike Harju, which is a bit of a diversion, this picks up running plotline from the end of The Infernal Train. There isn't much Baltimore in it, but it is still good since we get to learn more about what the fuck happened to Judge Duvic. Curious to see who the replacement artist will be here on out.\n\n**Universal War One** Ive been meaning to read this Uber popular European sci-fi epic for a long time. I was surprised at how relatable the characters were and how quickly you start to care about them (well, maybe not *all* of them). The main group is the 'Purgatory Squadron', which is kind of like the Suicide Squad, but in space. I wouldn't say the first chapter is slow (it actually is really good from the beginning, especially the mystery of the 'wall') but things really start popping off in the second of the three parts.  It looks like the 'war' aspect of the title is coming, but it really isn't.  I went in expecting huge, galactic battles, but it turns out to be more of a mystery and a time travel story. Like an Alien movie but with time travel instead of the alien. I ended up still liking it quite a bit and I will have to read the second volume. This ends up pretty neatly so I have no idea where they are gonna go with it next. I'm still hoping for a big, interstellar battle because the artist would do an amazing job with something like that. \n\n**Secret Warriors** by Jonathon Hickman was really entertaining. I can't help but rate it against other things, so... as a part of the Hickman Marvel Saga (ok well first of all I don't think it IS part of the big connecting series of stories he is doing so this is entirely unfair) it is the least of his works that I've read. Fantastic Four and Avengers are revelatory works of epic scale that don't lack anything. I can't put my finger on why this isn't as good, but I think it might be because Hickman didn't have as free a reign. It still is an insanely readable story with a bunch of fascinating characters.  Compared to Fury: My War Gone By, it also isn't as good but stands favorably next to that seminole work, which is more than you can say for most. I will admit these are the only two Nick Fury books I have read, but both were great and have me wanting more (please give me more Fury reading suggestions). As much as I did like this book,  the fact that I was hoping for little tie-ins to the larger story may have colored my opinion on it. As for coloring, though, that was also a bit lackluster. I noticed throughout the book the colorist was a studio name or someone with a studio name and that might be what was wrong. It felt like the coloring was just serviceable, like someone just doing a job. Nothing to really complain about, but nothing above average. The line art throughout was more than just serviceable, but after being used to such amazing artists on Hickman books it doesn't stack up. Overall I liked it a lot and can see myself reading it again. Would recommend it to anyone thinking of reading some Hickman or Fury.\n\n**G.I. Joes** Ive been trying to read through the entire Marvel Era Joe's series for years now. Well...technically I tried only twice but I've had the whole thing since just a little after I started reading comics again several years ago (full disclosure: it is one of the few torrents I still have from those early years). My original plan was just to read it again because of the nostalgia for it, the TV show, and the toys. I think the first time I got almost to tenth issue before I just couldn't take the \nwriting style. It is old fashioned even for the time period it was written in. Lately, I've been kicking around the idea of getting together a collection of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow because they are awesome as fuck and I always loved them. I tried googling for all the important issues they were in (not just appearances because who knows which is or isn't significant), but didn't have much luck. Then I remembered I had this on my old laptop so I decided to just read through it and mark down which issues I should get as I read it all. Holy shit it is worse than I remembered. Maybe it is just because it is literally a homework assignment I have given myself AND I have a huge list of great stuff to read that I already own, but I couldn't get through more than 3 issues. I didn't have any patience for it. In a way it was cool. Very nostalgic and I can appreciate even more how Tom Scioli is both tipping his hat and lampooning that style a bit in Transformers vs. G.I. Joe. The art is great when there is a great artist like Trimpe,  but even skimming the words and focusing on the art wasn't doing it for me. At some point I'm gonna give this another go, but I'm going to have to just skim through super fast because I'm really only interested in finding the stuff I want to cherry pick and collect into my own custom hardcover.\n\n**Thor #1 and 2** decided to take a quick look at what all the hubbub was about with the new Thor. It was alright. Probably better if you were reading the previous series and probably building to something, but it didn't do much for me. it just wasn't what I go to a Thor book for, I guess. \n\n**All New Captain America #1** was ok as well. Liked it a bit better than Thor #1. Just setting up the new character so far. Probably will check back in when stuff has actually happened. It didn't turn me off at all, though, and the new voice in the Captain America role is actually a bit refreshing.\n\n**Axis #3-5** Was starting to think Remender was taking crazy pills halfway through #4, but #5 takes it into a better direction. If only slightly. This event is really not doing much more than bridge the gap between the two Uncanny Avengers series. I just hope the second one is as good as the first. None of these Marvel books really got my juices going, but they were entertaining enough.\n\n**Unity #1-12** The very first issue introduces how awesome Ninjak can be in the hands of Matt Kindt and features Aric displaying the power of the X-O Manowar armor by killing and entire team of powered operatives within seconds, two of which he killed by frying the head of one and then sending the superheated head through the other persons damn torso. This is a hell of a way to start a series. The artwork by Braithwait and then CAFU is basically what I think of as typical superhero comic  art. Not saying it is bad, but it a bit too mainstream for me. I usually am more into more stylized   or individualistic. It more than gets the job done here. Unity zooms along really well, with an awesome team of characters that are equally intriguing (except Ninjak, he's obviously the coolest) and he introduces Dr. Silk as the great evil genius of the Valiant universe that he is.  This is some of the best superhero writing Kindt has done so far (maybe not the absolute best). Specifically, the way he writes Ninjak you can tell he's more fascinated with him than the others. After reading some of the original series, I can say I don't think he was ever written this well. It was only a matter of time before he was given a solo title to write and I am eagerly awaiting that. In issue #8, Unity finally suffers from that inevitable superhero comic plague: the crossover event. From here till #11, Unity ties into the Armor Hunters  storyline, which I didn't read any of but surprisingly still isn't too bad. The issues aren't direct continuations of the main event, so it basically reads like the team just going on odd missions. Issue #9 features [this awesome page](http://imgur.com/O6jmTvr) which is a really cool aside right as Ninjak jumps into some action.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416178591", "subreddit": "comicbooks", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

I also suggest finding a banner that is 1980 long, but it probably won't be ahlf bad considering the way yours is cut. background-repeat: repeat; means that the banner will repeat once it ends.\n\nI also suggest removing the title from the banner, and instead adding it as logo. You can also give it a hover over. If you set it as a hover, it will redirect you to the main page of the subreddit, while the banner will be unclickable.\n\n    .pagename a{\n    display:block;\n    background-image:url(%%     %%);\n    background-repeat:no-repeat;\n    width:     px;\n    height:     px;\n    padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\n    }\n\nUse the \"padding\" to move the logo where you want it. it goes as following: Upwards-&gt;Downwards, Left-&gt; right. If you want it to be 20 pixels down, and 100 to the right, you write: 20px 100px 0px 0px. Keep the width: and Height: to the size you want the banner to be in.\n\nAdd:\n\n    .pagename a:hover{\n\nand copy paste everything else under it if you also want a hover effect (you'll need a new picture for this. and example is:\n\n    .pagename a{\n    display:block;\n    background-image:url(%%logo1%%);\n    background-repeat:no-repeat;\n    width:390px;\n    height:235px;\n    margin:0 auto;\n    font-size:0px;\n    padding:0px 0px 0 0;\n    color:#364657;\n    left:0px;\n    position:absolute;\n    top:px;\n    z-index:0;\n    }\n\n    .pagename a:hover{display:block;\n    background-image:url(%%logo2%%);\n    background-repeat:no-repeat;\n    width:390px;\n    height:235px;\n    margin:0 auto;\n    font-size:0px;\n    padding:0px 0px 0 0;\n    color:#364657;\n    left:0px;\n    position:absolute;\n    top:px;\n    z-index:0;\n    }\n\n\n---\n\nIf ya gonna do it, atleast do it right and properly.

I may have except for he is always back and forth in my life and it is driving me up the wall.\n\nEverytime one of us is single, we see if the other is; this is the only man I have ever felt that twinge of love for. He would only talk to me if he was either a.) single b.) about to be single or c.) needed an ego boost (that seems to only be of late.) So, naturally, whenever he starts talking to me again I get excited, and hopeful.\n\nLast time we talked, way back in the sumer, I essentially told him I wanted him to drop dead; I saw him on Sunday (super briefly) since he was home on leave and I was home for a family dinner. So, of course my natural reaction was to drown myself in wine and ice cream. He called me today, to confess to me he can't hurt her by leaving her, but stop thinking about me.\n\nNo. NONONONONONO.

{"body": "&gt; I am pointing to real things. I'm just not linking to them. Because, like I asked, what's the point? You're cherry picking a few legal cases, grossly misunderstanding how they apply as precedent, and claiming consumers always have standing on labeling while producers don't.\n&gt; \n\nYou keep moving the goalposts rather than actually pointing to things. If you pointed at specific things, then specific details of those cases which are relevant to your writing could actually be evaluated instead of puppeted around like a boogeyman. There is a ton of precedent for these kinds of labelling cases to be dismissed or at the least for the plaintiff to outright lose. When plaintiffs win cases against labelling laws it is for reasons which are not applicable here. If you believe otherwise then please refer to specific cases by name or docket. Barring that I have to presume that it's a lot of hot air. That is the point. I'm not cherry-picking, I'm showing the legal precedents that are relevant. Producers. I can't even get you to mention any single case where anything you said is totally true. Producers don't have standing for things like this because there is no harm to allege. I give reasons for my statements. Whether you read them or not is beyond my control.\n\n&gt;Bullshit. I read the list. I pointed out to you that just because they say that's the purpose doesn't mean it's a legitimate purpose. This is super basic stuff in reading comprehension.\n\nSo you're saying that it isn't legitimate because **you** don't want to agree with it. Well too bad. I don't know what to tell you but most of it it is pretty much boilerplate consumer rights language. You also misused *reading comprehension* which is kind of funny.\n\n&gt;Again, basic understanding of how different things are different would help you suss this out. But let me help you. Ingredients are a legitimate health and safety concern. There are people with allergies and intolerances or who seek to avoid certain ingredients for all sorts of reasons. Clearly this is a legitimate requirement that serves the public good and applies to all packaged foods, even in cases like water.\n\nNo there are things that have to be in an ingredients list because they are allergens. Water, molasses, and a whole lot of other stuff are not on the list of allergens which need to be listed in the ingredients. Also the \"May include:\" stuff is wholly voluntary. The reasons you give are not the reasons why ingredients need to be listed. They are listed so that you know what you are buying and in what relative quantity they are in. If you look at some guacamole labels you will see avocado is not the first ingredient. This informs you of the filler content and if the price reflects what you would want to pay for a not-so premium product. This is why it is required to label each ingredient in descending order of predominance and why cardamon, cinnamon, paprika, cumin, and other spices can just go in the ingredients list as *spices* and sometimes *spice and coloring*. Same reason why companies aren't supposed to make weird shaped containers to make their product appear bigger and why the net weight or volume is labeled. It's all in the FDC. And no it's a tad pointless to list water as an ingredient to water (but it isn't required to do that for single ingredient stuff). Then you have COOL laws which don't match up with your reasons either. I mean they let me make choices with my money, just like GMO labeling would. But it isn't a health issue.\n\n&gt;What's different about GMOs? There have never been health and safety concerns demonstrated. GMO health and safety is extensively studied.. Seriously. And though there's overwhelming evidence of the safety of GMOs, studies continue.\n\nThat's nice and all but the fact that they have genes found outside their taxonomy is a pretty obvious difference. That alone is enough for people to make ethical decisions about it. They may not share *your* ethics, as I'm sure you want to point out, but don't confuse your ethics for universal ones. [I gave a whole list of it too](http://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/2myces/the_gap_between_the_no_yes_votes_on_measure_92/cm9yp9p) so any confusion about what other reasons there might be is disingenuous.\n\n\n&gt;Think about it. DNA consists of adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine. RNA swaps out the thymine for uracil. In a GMO, all that's different is the insertions of DNA base pairs at a particular point in the genome. Corn is corn regardless of whether its genome has been altered transgenically, through selective breeding, or induced mutation.\n\n\nIf corn is corn than you wouldn't need a license to grow some corn but not others. This is tautologically correct so I'm not sure how you missed that. If corn is corn than farmers wouldn't have developed so many different cultivars over the years. They'd all be just at good for human consumption, animal feed, ethanol, popcorn, etc. I'm also pretty certain that it would be pointless to speak to you about genetics if you think stating a difference between DNA and RNA and that genes are sometimes recombinantly inserted through induced transcription changes actually says anything about 'corn being corn'.  For all the cussing you do you sure say a lot of really stupid shit. A lot.\n\n&gt;(And before you mention Cry9C, approval for human and animal consumption is normally sought now as a result of that incident. Its safety was never determined. The amount present was so low that it likely would not have produced allergic reactions. But the incident shows why the safety approval process is important and the most effective way to keep potentially harmful transgenic foods off the market.)\n\nBut I thought corn is corn? I thought GMOs were just peachy. I mean you're hurting your own argument here by saying more stupid shit.\n\n&gt;Again, bullshit. Organic labels aren't legally required. And either way, the labels don't tell consumers things that they claim to actually want to know. Most people get warm fuzzies buying organic because \"it's better for the environment\" or it \"doesn't have pesticides\" or \"it's more nutritious.\" It's been fantastic marketing, but it's a deception.\n\nThey aren't legally required but they sell for a premium and business like money. The 'organic' label means that food has had to meet certain requirements. I don't actually care how **you** feel about it because you have a lot of stupid thoughts on it and your view isn't really relevant. Plus more and more consumers want to know what is in their food. Your ideology is fading bub but you can't grok reality.\n\n&gt;That comes back around to that list of reasons you linked. They're simply not true in addition to being aimed at merely satisfying curiosity.\n\nA list of reasons why people want to know what food is GMO is a lie. It can't be a lie if those are reasons people gave. Are you on heavy opiates?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416695435", "subreddit": "oregon", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

That being said, a big reason I took the gig was to check out the spectacle.\n\nThese dudes are rich. But they sure aren't the elite (Hong Kong has the most billionaires per capita, and most near-billionaires...those weren't the people at this event). They were definitely rowdy though (as most expat-bankers in Asia are), and the article did describe a large group of them pretty well (on the plus side, strippers didn't want to hang out with 200 drunk white dudes, so they chilled with me and the other comic the whole night). Don't know how illuminati it was, but it was definitely a cool event to work. Not gonna lie but if they ask me to do it again I'd do it in a heartbeat. It did help that they really enjoyed being made fun of because of how rich they are.\n\nOn a positive note, the Vice guys got a lot of photos of us (we didn't want our name or photos in the article) and sent them to us for free.

I have a pre-set SSH session on my phone (Android so I use VX ConnectBot) which is defined to connect home and then run the correct WOL command and exit. This makes it super-easy to use and has the benefit of you being able to see the 'startup' SSH session working. If you just use a WOL app all you know is the packet was sent by your phone but if your computer never starts up you've no idea if your server was on the right IP at the time the packet was sent, or if the packet got through the firewall and port-forward correctly etc. It makes 'standard' WOL really hard to trouble-shoot when not at home but an SSH session means at least you can see where the process fails (if it does).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417135521", "subreddit": "HomeNetworking", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Something I have seen come up in previous Flood Threads is that people assume that a Star Wars Flood = Halo Flood. \n\nIt doesn't. \n\nThe Flood creates its combat forms from those it has overcome. That means that a Flood in the Star Wars universe will have Stormtroopers and ISDs. \n\nThat said, It also means that the Flood are going to be weaker in some universes. \n\nI think the Reapers from Mass Effect could do it. They are going to be facing off against the Flood form of the Mass effect species (humans, Assari, Turians) and they were doing that anyway. It might be a bit harder as they would be unified, but the Reapers were going to win no mater what without the Crucible. \n\nNow the Last time I mentioned this some people thought that the Reapers were AI or Robots. They are NOT. \n\nReapers are neither AI nor VI. Legion said that each Reaper consists of billions of organic minds inhabiting a single body. [To each[reaper] a nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqtAHNQT3-w). They are created by using the genetic material from a sing species to create Reapers like Sovereign and Harbinger. Remaining material are used to create other class Reaper or used to create ground units like Cannibals, Marauders ect.\n\n\nReapers are neither AI nor VI, they are organic-synthetic sentient nations in a single body. Think Legion, taken to a higher and much upgraded degree.\n\nThe Games make a big point in the leviathan DLC, the Games ending, ME1 ending, most interactions with Reapers, that they are NOT AI. Hundreds of Organic minds sheltered within a Giant Metal warship. The Flood can't reach them there. \n\n[Reapers sound cool too](http://www.youtubemultiplier.com/54750ab7ca292-reaper-war-sound-effects.php)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417135822", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
