{"body": "I'm... not 100% following what your questions are. \n\nWhy were there so many gospels? Why were (only?) some of them accepted in the canon?\n\nI'll try to answer these as best I can.\n\n______\n\nImagine that, as 'Christianity' is born for the first time, it takes a while for it to get off the ground -- at least in terms of literature. In the first two or three decades after Jesus, there may be a few less \"formal\" writings floating around: some of the Pauline epistles, earlier collections of sayings/mini-narratives, like [Q](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_source), etc. Then, around the year 70, you start to see more \"formalized\" literature (like the earliest full gospel); and 30 years after *this*, as it's grown more, you have a dozen or two of these writings: additional gospels, pseudepigraphical epistles, things like Revelation, etc. By the middle/end of the *second* century, we're in a kind of literary Renaissance for Christianity, with all types of writings in all literary genres from all sorts of different Christian sects. \n\nYet the modern (canonical) New Testament is mostly composed of a fairly early stratum of writings: ranging from a couple that were written around the year 50, to others that were composed in the early second century (and maybe a couple pushing towards the middle of the 2nd century). \n\nThere are multiple reasons for this. One might be that, as time went on, Christian sects developed that were wildly divergent from what Christianity was like in the first couple of decades; and, just like in the earlier Jewish sectarianism situation, their writings didn't gain wide acceptance outside of certain niche communities (though the situation with Christianity is kind of unique: for example, just look at how different the Gospel of John is from the other three gospels, theologically speaking).\n\nAnother reason is a bit more obvious: the earliest Christian writings would have had more time to be disseminated, and so virtually *all Christians* would have (eventually) been aware of them. For example, as opposed to their being early, independent \"competitors,\" things like the so-called Gnostic gospels (and the Gospel of Thomas, etc.) *built upon* the earliest authoritative Christian writings (the epistles of Paul, the four gospels, etc.), reconfiguring them.\n\nAnother consequence of the early dissemination of Christian writings is that – to the early church fathers – their antiquity automatically entailed their authenticity/authority; which was aided by the authority of the various personages associated with them. Early Christian presbyters/theologians/writers like Papias and Irenaeus and others (in the second century) still had \"memories\" of their direct predecessors ascribing authorship of certain gospels to people that were personally known. Or perhaps it's *several* degrees removed: their predecessors' predecessors, or theirs (even in the early 2nd century they speak of the \"ancient\" or \"old\" Christians). \n\nFinally, one other factor is coherence of *style*/*theology*. Someone could forge an epistle in the name of, say, Paul – which was done many times, even in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries (cf. the epistle to the Ephesians [and possibly Colossians, too], Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy, etc.) – but if it appeared to speak with a genuine Pauline authority/\"voice,\" its authenticity wouldn't be widely challenged... especially if the circumstances of its forgery weren't known. Interestingly, we *do* have (purported) instances where a forger was caught \"in the act.\" For example, the early Christian author Tertullian mentions that a presbyter was actually caught in the process of forging the [Acts of Paul/Thecla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Paul).\n\nConversely, we have a bit better critical grasp on the evolution of early Christianity itself (as compared to the church fathers of the 2nd century and beyond); and we've been able to do extremely sophisticated literary analysis of individual works... of a kind that the church fathers could never have dreamed of. For examples: we can analyze various New Testament epistles attributed to \"Peter\" and \"Paul,\" etc. and – in conjunction with what we know about their biographies, and the sort of theological/philosophical terms or concepts they would refer to, and about the evolution of the church in the 1st and 2nd centuries etc. – we can reasonably suggest that certain of these were probably forged in their name. (To take Paul as an example here, refer to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/2d4bnn/the_down_and_dirty_on_the_pastoral_epistles_iii/) previous thread, where we get into some of the technical arguments for the inauthenticity of the Pastoral Epistles [= 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus].)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417835103", "subreddit": "AcademicBiblical", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

And are Paul's epistles the earliest source for Christianity or are there any documents before the Paulian epistles?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Finally, one other factor is coherence of style/theology. Someone could forge an epistle in the name of, say, Paul – which was done many times, even in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries (cf. the epistle to the Ephesians [and possibly Colossians, too], Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy, etc.) – but if it appeared to speak with a genuine Pauline authority/\"voice,\" its authenticity wouldn't be widely challenged... especially if the circumstances of its forgery weren't known.

I understand that it was used for authority, but I thought the message and ethics they were spreading were for truth so why would they lie?\n\nAlso, what lead scholars to initially reject the traditional authorships? What was the catalyst for questioning the tradition?\n\n&gt;&gt;Conversely, we have a bit better critical grasp on the evolution of early Christianity itself (as compared to the church fathers of the 2nd century and beyond); and we've been able to do extremely sophisticated literary analysis of individual works – of a kind that the church fathers could never have dreamed of.

From the formation of the RAN until 1967, Australian warships used the British [White Ensign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ensign) as their ensign. However, this led to situations where Australian vessels were mistaken for British ships, and when Australia became involved in the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), the RAN was effectively fighting under the flag of another, uninvolved nation. Proposals were made in 1965 for a unique Australian ensign, which was approved in 1966, and entered use in 1967.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/VxynvXI.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Naval_Ensign_of_Australia.svg) - *The Australian White Ensign*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Alan ^McNicoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_McNicoll) ^| [^HMAS ^Boonaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Boonaroo) ^| [^List ^of ^Australian ^flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australian_flags) ^| [^Flag ^of ^Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Australia) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmpkqta) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cmpkqta)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418112874", "subreddit": "WarshipPorn", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

From the formation of the RAN until 1967, Australian warships used the British [White Ensign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ensign) as their ensign. However, this led to situations where Australian vessels were mistaken for British ships, and when Australia became involved in the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), the RAN was effectively fighting under the flag of another, uninvolved nation. Proposals were made in 1965 for a unique Australian ensign, which was approved in 1966, and entered use in 1967.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/6piRGrW.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Naval_Ensign_of_Australia.svg) - *The Australian White Ensign*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Alan ^McNicoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_McNicoll) ^| [^HMAS ^Boonaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Boonaroo) ^| [^List ^of ^Australian ^flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australian_flags) ^| [^Flag ^of ^Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Australia) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmrirb0) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cmrirb0)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418272018", "subreddit": "WarshipPorn", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Of course you'd need a relatively quiet place to practice first, maybe take up hiking? The only thing I can say about it, is that it shows you a different way of looking at reality in a non-judgemental way. I don't mean we go around judging people, but our minds judge the noise and deems it \"irritating\". Being in a mindful state bypasses this judgement the mind puts on things like that. It's not a magic cure, and it only works short term for me but is highly effective in that short term. The default \"20 mins\" the material suggested starting with is the longest i've been able to truly tolerate and accept an irritating thing in my environment, which is 19 minutes and 59 seconds longer than I ever could before. I don't mean i'm sitting in a meditative state like some idiot while the neighbor is sawing wood either, i'm able to passively accept the noises for about 20 minutes while doing other tasks, i'm assuming as a consequence of my practice and education about my self.
