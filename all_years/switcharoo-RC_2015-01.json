{"body": "It's because Hendrix is doing Blues harp and Guitar playing not just blues guitar playing. He's picking it up from The [Yardbirds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfzZ5N5nw0) (strong emphasis on Shape of Things when it comes to Hendrix) which also births Clapton, Jeff Beck on this track, and Jimmy Page because [live Yardbirds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2mFGqPZqRA) and Yardbirds in general (Clapton on this track) has lots of Harmonica and they all do the same in their playing. Basically if you're playing in C Major [these notes are cool too](http://archive.harmonicasessions.com/aug04/acc2.jpg) and you account for breathing in the playing which gives some life into it.\n\n[All Along the Watchtower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YanjY9CsPDQ) should have given this away because the Bob Dylan version is quite Harmonica heavy, as is most Dylan work which is a pretty obvious Hendirx influence. Then if you're playing one you get this sort of louder distortedish sound right in your face, you know Hendrix. \n\nReally when it comes to Hendrix playing don't forget the obvious which is Bob Dylan, The Yardbirds (imply this is obvious for most 60's influenced playing), and of course The Beatles (which has some blues Harp in it too) and don't forget to account for all the melodies in the Blues, not just the guitar and all the styles of guitar playing (ie Delta, Chicago, and Hill Country).\n\n\nEdit: Oh yeah a few more things, [Lonnie Mack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAH-G_aXHqY) (this is why SRV gets closer to the Hendrix ideas than others, SRV loves Lonnie Mack), [Cliff Gallup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTkipmEmCmU) of [Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3gxQ1tetAQ) (Rockabilly, better grab Scotty Moore of Elvis's work as well), these are more given influences for that era, but we more or less largely forgot these things.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420105445", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey hey hey!!!! So have spent 90% of my dive career in Indonesia. \n\nWould definitely suggest a few places.\n\n**Nusa Lembongan**\nMy home away from home away from work. I did my Dive master training there with Blue Corner Dive. AMAZING dive company but often VERY busy. If you don't book in advance, I can almost guarantee you won't get a spot. These guys have been filling up all their boats in low season. The free gear that divers get is very high quality and boats are nice.\n\nIt's a beautiful little island off the coast of Bali (45 minute boat ride from Sanur). The island is pretty much a haven for surfers and divers. The community there is really laid back and chill. You don't get many of the typical Bali tourists which is fantastic.\n\nThe diving is fantastic! Some of the most beautiful corals there, in addition to the home of a number of local manta rays. Most dive sites are going to be drift dives with some potentially strong currents. If you're pretty experienced I would suggest \"Blue Corner\" as a dive site (schooling marbled rays, and sometimes the goofy looking Mola Mola [which you'll be approaching Mola Mola season too]). Waters can be very cool / cold down to about 16 degrees at its worst, 23 - 25 on average.\n\nSome other great dive sites : \nToya Pakeh (BEAUTIFUL reefs) and just amazing fish. My favourite by far. Don't necessarily see big stuff.\nSouth Manta Point (as opposed to Manta Bay) - I've never not seen a manta here, but it takes boats a long time to get there so dive shops are less willing to go there. Seas have to be willing as well, as its unsafe to go there in big swell. If you don't see mantas, it's a cool dive site with awesome topography.\n\nYou may hear tons about Crystal Bay. Yes, you'll find some Mola there more frequently than others, but it's not a GREAT dive site if you don't see one.\n\n**Komodo :**\nCrazier currents than Nusa Lembongan but diving is also amazing. I did mine on a live aboard out of Bali, but you can also do land based diving out of Labuan Bajo (from what I've heard a bit of a dump, but it does the trick).\n\nJust gorgeous. Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. Saw my first manta there and fell instantly in love. \n\n**Sulawesi :**\nI haven't dived here in years, but I've heard it's still amazing. Lots of macro options as well up there.\n\nHopefully this helps a bit, it's dinner time!\n\nEdit: formatting", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420527038", "subreddit": "scuba", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The second time around, they sent important-looking letters and such, and after a while sent me a ['Letter Before Action'](http://i.imgur.com/uATFSaW.jpg), letting me know that unless the made-up amount of £100 was paid, court proceedings would begin. I did some research online, and found that this is common practice and people who ignore the parking company's letters entirely end up ignoring this one as well. Which can lead to not turning up for a court date and getting the CCJ. Long story short, there are very well-defined rules that a 'Letter Before Action' should adhere to, and parking companies never do. So I wrote them a polite letter to let them know that I was completely willing to defend the matter in court, but only if they'd send an LBA that complied with the law. They didn't bother, oddly enough...\n (Massive thanks to the folks at [PePiPoo](http://forums.pepipoo.com/) for the advice. Should be the first stop for anyone who wants to fight a ticket.)\n\nTL;DR - you probably don't have to pay but the parking companies are dicks, and will threaten you with poorly written legal notices to make you think you do.

{"body": "Tattoo artists cannot do as detailed of a work because it's difficult to see (ink is a translucent whitish color). And it will fade. Mine has a little, but for a friend of mine who had one on his arm, around the elbow it was almost completely gone in parts where he would rest him arm on, say, a table top or desk or whatnot within just a few months. The duration may be better now than when we got ours 10 years ago if they've since reformulated inks. The biggest downside was I paid a good bit for a very small custom piece I drew myself that I *never* saw or got to show off (because when are you ever around black light? Or are you going to carry one on you at all times just to show it off?) On the few occasions I was, it was so faint it was almost impossible to see anyway.  You have to be in an almost pitch black room with strong direct UV light right on it to see (as mentioned, it fades). I have seen it used to good effect to add cool details to a [colored tattoo](http://mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/uv-tattoo-yoda.jpg).

{"body": "Ok... bars with good bourbon and sub-30s...\n\nI would suggest the Rathskellar to eat then. Like I said it's mid range if you're going to drink but it's worth the money if you like a good beer. Mesh is nice but it's a little more of a quiet, relaxed environment, think engagement type place. Bazbeaux's is a little under where I'd see you wanting to go and Fogo de Chao is a little too much food for drinking a nice bourbon. Bonus points if you sit in the Beer Garden and they have live music to listen, but it's a little early for it.\n\nFor b) night life is hit or miss in Indy. It is what YOU make it. There are a lot of fun things to do depending on what you're into. Some suggestions for things to do while downtown. Keep in mind that a Monday game is going to be a little bit bland of a nightlife since it's early in the week. Our big nights for going out are Wed, Fri and Sat.\n\n* [Canal Walk](http://www.downtownindy.org/explore-downtown/cultural-districts/the-canal-and-white-river-state-park/) - This can be really romantic or meh depending on the weather and time of year. It was modeled after San Antonio's canal to try to be a place for people to just enjoy getting outside. Since it's February it might be a little too cold for this one, but it's worth a shot if it's a nice day out.\n\n* [Slippery Noodle Inn](http://www.slipperynoodle.com/index.php) - If you like Blues, this is a great spot to stop at. It's had a ton of big artists and is always a good time. Just south of the Fieldhouse, it'd be a short walk to it (in Chicago terms, it's about 4-5 blocks away) and the scens is a decent scene.\n\n* Scotty's Brewhouse - After the game, there is an outdoor area at Scotty's as well as plenty of people inside. Something to consider for after dinner drinks.\n\n* [Duckpin Bowling](http://www.fountainsquareindy.com/bowling/) - It's a little tame but I figured maybe you want to do something different. This would be it. The game is different slightly, but it's still Bowling so not sure how much this would be your thing or not.\n\n* [Broad Ripple](http://www.discoverbroadripplevillage.com/) - Indy is a small enough city that you can go outside of downtown in less than 20 minutes. It's like going from Schaumburg to Elgin to go to the casino... Or being on the skyway to get across town. Lol. Broad Ripple is just north and has TONS of bars and small restaurants. For the 20 something's you'll fit right in. If you want to try some places there, Broad Ripple Tavern has good prices and good pool tables. Triton Brewery has a small spot there with good IPAs and Union Jacks is a nice place to relax and chill. \n\n* [Eiteljorg Museum](http://www.eiteljorg.org/) - This one is hit or miss. It's a great spot if you like a lot of culture, but the culture is American Indian. I enjoy it since I have genealogy there, but some people just look at it and go \"oh a tiki mask\", etc. Still pretty cool.\n\n* [NCAA Hall of Champions](http://www.ncaahallofchampions.org/index.php) - Since you like basketball you might like this. It's a cool museum about NCAA sports. I've yet to go myself, but I can't wait till my son gets a little older so we can enjoy it together.\n\n* [Indianapolis Zoo](http://www.indianapoliszoo.com/SitePages/Home.aspx) - The zoo is like most others, but they just added a cool Orangutan exhibit as well as a brand new baby tiger was just born. The Ocean exhibit isn't Shedd's Aquarium, but it's pretty sweet nonetheless.\n\n* [South Bend Chocolate Company](http://www.sbchocolate.com/) - Trust me when I say go here. If your GF is any sort of chocolate lover, you will get lucky taking her here. Amazing chocolate and all kinds. It's right on the Circle near PotBelly's so you can stop here after the game for a hot chocolate and some turtles or fudge and have a nice little chat.\n\n* [Nicky Blaine's](http://nickyblaines.com/) - For the last one I thought to toss out something different. Nicky Blaine's is a cocktail lounge and cigar bar. It's a great place to go if you do enjoy the occasional martini and cigar.\n\n____________\n\nI tried to give you a wide variety of things to possibly do. There are plenty of places to shop, plenty more places to eat than I have mentioned. But this would be a good starting point to check out. Monday's are usually bleah days but that's only if you like being around a bunch of people like I do. If you're a bit more relaxed and enjoy quiet nightlife then this is the perfect time to go. \n\nRemember that you don't HAVE to stay downtown if you don't want to. Indianapolis is small enough that I can get from anywhere in the city in less than 30 minutes. Unless you're going all the way across town it's really well designed. So don't feel that you have to stay in the downtown hotels if you don't want to. \n\nEnjoy the time here. The fashion is about 5 years late, the dancing is a little mundane compared to Chicago, but the people are great and helpful for the most part. Let me know if you have any questions about anything I've posted!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421011488", "subreddit": "pacers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Other than Graceland(which is really expensive), there isn't much to do in Memphis but it has some great restaurants. Corky's is where the tourists go for barbecue, but a lot of the locals go to the [Germantown Commissary](http://www.commissarybbq.com/). It's a very small restaurant but it's really good. Also, stop by [Muddy's Bake Shop](http://www.muddysbakeshop.com/) to satisfy your sweet tooth. It's a cupcake shop (they do cookies and pies too) that has some of the best sweets you'll ever have. I've never been to Gigi's cupcakes, but anyone that I've talked to who has been to both likes Muddy's much better. I wouldn't make Memphis a priority unless you love barbecue and Elvis.\n\nI don't know too much about St. Louis but I can tell you about two things. First, they have a [really cool zoo](http://www.stlzoo.org/). For real, it's a great zoo. Second, if you love historic districts make sure you visit [St. Charles](http://www.historicstcharles.com/). It's just northwest of St. Louis and they have one of the coolest historic districts I've been to. The historic district is just across the street from a [small park](http://www.stcharlesparks.com/143/parks/frontier-park.php). There's no playground (I don't know if you'd have any children going along) but the entire area is really scenic. The park is right on the Missouri river. I went there on a solo roadtrip, found the historic district, introduced it to my parents and now we'll drive there a few times a year (it's 5 hours one way). If you're looking for a really quaint, scenic area St. Charles is a great place to go.\n\nAlso, if you've never heard about [geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play), I'd suggest looking into it before you go anywhere. It's really fun and you can find some really cool places that even the locals don't know about :)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421558477", "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "But your source is full of straw men Shroom. When the writer says:\n\n&gt;\"However, to use this information to conclude that humans \"cannot\" eat meat, or \"must have\" the same physical traits as other predators to do so, or did not adapt to meat in the diet, is logically invalid and bogus.\"\n\nMills does not state that we \"cannot\" eat meat. We are fully *capable* of doing so, but are not adept at doing so.\n\nHe totally gives himself away in this next bit:\n\n&gt;Inasmuch as meat is a small but significant part of the diet of chimps, however--who also lack the carnivore adaptations (sharp teeth, claws, etc.)--we observe that the assumption is obviously false.\n\nThis is straight out of the arsenal of meat-eating defenders books. Come on. [This article from Harvard](http://web.cast.uark.edu/local/icaes/conferences/wburg/posters/nconklin/conklin.html) on primate eating habits shows that meat doesn't even appear on their diet. Now there are other studies, such as [this one by the Honolulu Zoo](http://web.archive.org/web/20110726153332/http://www.honoluluzoo.org/chimpanzee.htm), which states that there is a non-plant consumption, but it's termites. That's hardly omnivorous, which is classified as a 50-50 split between meat and plants.\n\n[Craig B. Stanford](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/%7Estanford/chimphunt.html), Ph.D:\n\n&gt;\"Chimpanzees are largely fruit eaters, and meat composes only about 3% of the time they spent eating overall, less than in nearly all human societies.\"\n\nAnd biologist Rob Dunn says that chimps eat meat \"[on average, nine days a year](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/08/02/how-to-eat-like-a-chimpanzee/)\". So that fellow's claim is shallow as a puddle, because any way you slice it, the chimp diet is at least 95-99% plants.\n\n&gt;The analysis ignores the impact that human intelligence has had on morphology, specifically the evolutionary effect of technology (stone tools and cooking), as well as possible morphological changes to support language--yet another unique human feature.\n\nDr. Robert W. Sussman debunks that argument as well in the following:\n\n&gt;\"Our intelligence, cooperation and many other features we have as modern humans developed from our attempts to out-smart the predator,\" says Sussman.... The idea of \"Man the Hunter\" is the generally accepted paradigm of human evolution, says Sussman, \"It developed from a basic Judeo-Christian ideology of man being inherently evil, aggressive and a natural killer. In fact, when you really examine the fossil and living non-human primate evidence, that is just not the case.\"\n\n&gt;Sussman's research is based on studying the fossil evidence dating back nearly seven million years. \"Most theories on Man the Hunter fail to incorporate this key fossil evidence,\" Sussman says. \"We wanted evidence, not just theory. We thoroughly examined literature available on the skulls, bones, footprints and on environmental evidence, both of our hominid ancestors and the predators that coexisted with them.\" ...\n\n&gt;But what Sussman and Hart discovered is that Australopithecus afarensis was not dentally pre-adapted to eat meat. \"It didn't have the sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods,\" Sussman says. \"These early humans simply couldn't eat meat. If they couldn't eat meat, why would they hunt?\"\n\n&gt;It was not possible for early humans to consume a large amount of meat until fire was controlled and cooking was possible. Sussman points out that the first tools didn't appear until two million years ago. And there wasn't good evidence of fire until after 800,000 years ago.\n\nI'm not a wild-eyed Vegan trying to convert the masses to stop eating meat. I'm just a guy who was presented with overwhelming evidence, and based upon it changed my mind. The same way I've done with jut about everything I believe in. I think one thing, I learn, I say 'hmm' and then change my mind. Capn_Blackbeard is infinitely better versed at this than I am. He made me realise that the best evidence is our anatomy, not what our ancestors ate in the recent past.  \n\nUsing historical references to say what's natural to eat and isn't, is pretty much the same as waiting for a several thousand years and saying 'hmm well humans ate a lot of McDonald's so clearly we're meant to eat lots of trans fat and pink slime'. Noooo x3\n\nOur ancestors ate meat because they chose to do so, acting out of instinct, going against what their bodies were adapted to do. To a certain extent we've imposed that 'unaturalness' to cats. They're true carnivores, and yet we feed them vegetables in the form of catfood. They *can* eat vegetables, yet they're not adapted for it. We can eat carboard too. Doesn't mean it's necessarily good for us.\n\nAnyway [this is the site](http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/why.html) that /u/Capn_Blackbeard gave me. It made sense to me on various levels. I'm not all that attached to meat, it helps animals by not killing them, helps the environment, ends a heinous form of work that our proletarian comrades are forced to work in, within those industrial meat manufacturing lines, and is even healthier for my body. Kind of a win win if you ask me. Especially if I'm not losing anything by doing it.\n\nYou want to eat meat, have it x3 It's your choice after all.

{"body": "Butting in here for a quick recommendation.   Your 70 will likely be unaware of the issues.  He'll likely tell you to pray about them, read the scriptures, and stop talking to people who are critical.  He may rain down love and hugs or fire and brimstone.   He may even send you to talk to an official historian, or he may just let it lie where it will. \n\n**Step 1**.  Bring a tape recorder.  Put it in plain view between the two of you.  Let him know you're recording this.  Tell him it's for your own personal use, but you may share it with your family and friends when they ask about your disbelief (keep to that).   If he objects, ask him why he doesn't feel confident enough in his belief to stand by his witness.    Turn it off if he insists, but make sure you have on the record that you are doing this because he is afraid of saying something that is untrue.   Let him respond to that if he will, on record. \n\n**Step 2**.   Bring out the essays.  Ask him how he can trust an organization that is lying when they try to disclose previous lies.  Nauvoo polygamy is the low hanging fruit.  Book of Abraham and Book of Mormon ones are also great to show flat out lies.  Here are [some reddit threads on the essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/wiki/lds_apologetic_essays), and below are some of my rebuttals.  [Mormonthink also has some great resources](http://mormonthink.com/essays-responses-intro.htm). Document the lies, document the truth, and print up both of these.  Bonus points if you use LDS resources.  \n\n* [Word of Wisdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lvm3n/new_lds_church_site_admits_that_early_saints_and/cc3a5s2)\n\n* [Polygamy - original](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1t1dcz/plural_marriage_and_families_in_early_utah_the/ce3gj9c)\n\n* [Polygamy - early Utah](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1t1dcz/plural_marriage_and_families_in_early_utah_the/ce3gj9c)\n\n* [Polygamy - nauvoo](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2k11cr/rebuttal_to_the_new_polygamy_essay_part_2_plural/)\n\n* [Book of Mormon](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1u1l16/essay_covering_book_of_mormon_translation/cedo0nz)\n\n* [First Vision](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1q5fjq/accounts_of_the_first_vision_on_ldsorg_gospel/cd9eajb)\n\n* [Becoming like God](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ywynr/new_ldsorg_topic_becoming_like_goddeification/cfoo3sh)\n\n* [Book of Abraham](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2a6n2w/rebuttal_to_the_book_of_abraham_essay/)\n\n**Step 3**.  Bring down the hammer with irrefutable evidence.  Bring out the scriptures.   Point out major [flaws such KJV translation errors in the Book of Mormon](http://infidels.org/library/modern/curt_heuvel/bom_kjv.html).  Point out the parts of the BoM [the current church disavows](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/25af3p/1830s_book_of_mormon_doctrine_vs_modern_mormon/). (ie: dark skin = curse).  Point out the differences in the 1830s BoM doctrine compared to current doctrine (ie: modalistic deity). Point out the [contradictions](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2fn0rt/10_explicit_contradictions_in_lds_scriptures/)(D&amp;C 132 vs Jacob - was David's concubines an abomination or not).  Bring up the CES letter , and point out the things [the apologists actually admitted](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2jk2od/quick_list_the_parts_of_the_ces_letter_apologists/).  Point out the evidence that we know is impossible (Jaradite Tower of Babel didn't create languages), not to mention the [rest of the book](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dxson/what_are_the_major_challenges_to_book_of_mormon/c9uwy9q).   Point out the frauds perpetrated in [the name of the LDS God](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2f0bqf/scandals_in_the_lds_church_help_me_flesh_out_the/). Have all of this printed up and ready to hand him.  Highlight the parts with a yellow highlighter.  Show your work. \n\n**Step 4**.  If he hasn't walked out yet, point out the [times the apologists and GAs got it wrong](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2s6ul4/top_12_apologetic_blunders_from_the_leaders_of/).  Remind him of the evidence you presented in step 3.  Ask him what he things God is like (merciful, loving, just, etc... expect a long winded answer to this soft ball).   Then point out that a merciful god would surely accept you for acting on the best information available from all sides of the discussion.  Point out that there are many religions with faithful adherents that all believe (have the 2 churches only scripture in your back pocket).  Tell him they all can't be right, but remind him that God is also just.  Tell him that God would judge you for acting against the greater light you have received, but you're always open for answers from his representatives or defenders that aren't full of lies and half-truths.  \n\n**Final Thoughts.** Don't be afraid to admit what you do and don't know.   Be honest.  Be sincere.  Be kind.  He's probably an elderly gentleman that has lived a life of privilege, being told he's always right, and soaked in this religion since the cradle.  He probably doesn't know any better, and frankly may be unable to comprehend a world where he is wrong.  Don't hold that against him, but don't let him hand wave away the problems either. \n\n**TL;DR: Step 1 - don't let him lie about this after the fact.  Step 2- show official lies as justification for why you disbelieve the top.  Step 3 - show the damning evidence.  Step 4 - Coup de gras by explaining why everyone has faith, but they all can't be wrong. Even if the pidgeon craps on the chess board, you and everyone else will have proof that your part of the game was flawless.**\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422316389", "subreddit": "exmormon", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My advice, do a full breakdown of income/costs before doing anything. If it's viable, go for it. If you find that it's \"doable\" but you would need to supplement your income, get that sorted out before leaving your work. iphone apps are a saturated market, web SaaS is incredibly vague - you can't just jump into them without a plan, or without testing the waters. Just throwing together a small team for a lifestyle business, where are you going to find this team? Will they work for free until you can pay them? Will you get investors? These are all questions that you need to have figured out.\n\nBefore you jump ship, make sure you're prepared, not even remote programming work is something you can randomly pickup and go. Unless you've got connections/clients already you're going to be starting from ground zero, and it'll probably be a few years before you can earn a decent amount since you'll be competing with international rates. Not to mention all the other headaches involved with being self-employed.\n\nTLDR: Make it work before making the jump.

{"body": "Yes, I did! I cannot tell a lie, or at least not this minute anyway. :)\n\nActually that I showed up for the retreat was embarrassing enough, because I didn't belong there. I was acquiescing to the demands of a one-time girlfriend back then. It wasn't a Buddhist retreat, it was a *wave-your-arms-in-the-air*, rock-n'-roll is here to stay, *Christian-rock retreat.* Nice, but not so nice at the same time.. I didn't belong there, but in order to plausibly have sex with my then girlfriend, well you know.. yada, yada, yada. :) \n\nSo there I was, and here I am now, gratefully a Buddhist. I was already a Buddhist by then, but social/sexual pressures led me there, in the guise of a so-called *Christian* \"seeking;\" I'm not embarrassed to say it now, so long after the fact. But being there under those pretenses were both embarrassing and very nervous for me. I felt terribly out of place, like a fish flopping around on the ground after being snared by a sharp barbed hook. The results weren't good believe me. Or maybe they were -- depending on how you look at it I suppose. \n\nI truly hated all the hoopla and the general bullshit that passed for spirituality and common ground, or *\"Christian\"* compassion, because no spirituality was really evident in my view, or very little of it. It was nothing more than an organized power play. Meal times consisted of: listen to the head-table-dude compare notes, and spread tainted church gossip. I'd rather we'd remained silent, which is mostly what I did anyway. I was already doing Buddhist things whether realizing it or not probably the former.\n\nHowever I liked some of the people I met; one guy *[a pastor at a small church in the Sierras]* was a real hoot. He had more jokes than an encyclopedia *[some slightly off-color too]*. I liked the food which was pretty damn good. And mostly I liked that I didn't have to do anything except show up for meals *[all locally prepared and catered]*. \n\nI spent most of my time either hiding in my assigned cabin, reading Buddhist literature surreptitiously, feigning sleep, or a headache, or nausea *[I'm still not sure that I was really feigning needing to puke though]*. Or, I was listening to bad Christian rock music, played way too freakin' loud. But, in contrast, there were a few interesting talks from one guy in particular *[a Brit ex-pat, living here]*. He actually had something to say, most of his speeches were engaging and stimulating. The rest of the fare generally all boorish, very mundane nonsense. When I wasn't hiding, or being part of a captive audience, or eating decently prepared meals, I played a little golf; also I sneaked out to Mickey D's once for a Big Mac &amp; Cheese with fries. \n\nI couldn't wait to get the hell out of there really. The whole thing was a disaster, because I didn't believe anything close to half of the crap they were trying to plaster onto the walls. The whole thing was painfully embarrassing. In fact it passed embarrassing long before the first day was half over. The funny pastor in my shared cabin, one good speaker in particular, and some tasty food, and a round of golf *[one of my favorite sporting pastimes]* is all I came away with. \n\nI later dropped the girlfriend in question, or she dropped me, I forget now which. But I stayed friendly with her to this day, because I loved her young daughter—still do *[she's nineteen now]*. I’d been to other Christian style retreats before, some were actually fun, but none were like this; none held the level of angst and self-embarrassment as that one did.
