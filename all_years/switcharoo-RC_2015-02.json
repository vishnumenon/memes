{"body": "Creating a base is called a tint back.  It's a commonly used professional technique to take platinum blonds back to a natural color.  It's proven tried and true, and it's extremely simple to do.  I do a tint back with your un natural colors, (I'm guessing it's a Semi-permanent dye, a color that doesn't have to be mixed with a developer) all you need to do is apply the color twice.  You apply and process the color on the most porous parts of your hair first and rinse with cold water.  You can wash it, but don't do anything else to it, so as not to create a barrier against it, dry and reapply the color again.  Use heat for maximum absorption for 20 minutes, then allow to cool for at least another 20 minutes, rinse with cold water, condition once then put a deep conditioning mask (preferably with silicones (they help create a barrier along the hair shaft)) and follow those directions.  \nIf you really really want your color to stay I suggest using a demi permanent number 9N on the lightest parts of your hair to create a bit of a darker base.  It'll also create a richer looking red.  Red's live best in levels 5 and 6, 7 is pushing it and turns pink very quick.   If you want to stay red and keep your color fresh I recommend trying to order [Tressa Watercolors Shampoo](http://www.tressa.com/products/product/detail/34)  It's a color depositing shampoo.  \nYou can't fix the damage, you can only slap a temporary band-aid type solution on it.  So best to re-adjust your game plan to target what you want to see happen specifically.   \n\nEDIT:  by lightening your hair, you've stripped it of melanin, which is the natural pigmentation that is found in hair.  Without it, new color doesn't have anything to attach to in the cortext of your hair, resulting in it washing out after 3 shampoos.

Do not waste your time and your energy on banalities and on things that do not concern you. \n\nStudy your religion! Study your religion!

Yes, sell the company stock.  I'm not sure how fast I'd suggest, it depends somewhat on your income.\n2. Start two Roth IRAs ([backdoor method](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/01/23/the-backdoor-roth-ira-advanced-version/) if you're above the income limit).  $5,500 x 2 for 2014, $5,500 x 2 for 2015. = $22,000 moved into tax-advantaged accounts like now.\n3. You should probably use a three-fund portfolio for your Vanguard account.  You'll qualify for Admiral shares and it'll allow greater [tax-efficiency](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement), especially if you allocate across accounts with your 401(k) and any IRAs as well.\n4. You should look at your [401(k) allocation](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds) as well, maybe even start there.\n5. Given the size of your taxable account, it almost definitely makes sense to switch out of the target date fund and allocate yourself.  It's likely the best option would be putting most of your domestic stocks and bonds in your 401(k) and IRAs and most of your international stocks in your taxable account.  Decide on your overall allocation, walk through the 401(k) Fund Selection Guide and read the tax-efficient fund placement and about [three-fund portfolios too](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_can_you_just_recommend_something_extremely_specific_to_get_me_started.3F) then try to figure out how to allocate across all of your accounts.\n6. First, though, I would recommend reading *The Bogleheads Guide to Investing* and [watch these videos](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy).  I think you would benefit from becoming more familiar with investing, etc. as the first order of business.\n7. Given that you're in the 33% tax bracket, I would probably try to avoid going into the 39.6% tax bracket from selling your company stock, but I think the 35% tax bracket is fine.  Another thing you want to avoid is hitting AMT.  I would consult with a CPA to come up with a plan to sell your company stock.\n8. I would not pay off your student loans early with those interest rates.\n\nedit: added bullets 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424074400", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In terms of Joe Schmo's vs celebrity's expectations of privacy, I think it has to do with social norms.\n\nMany celebrities have made a conscious decision to be in the limelight. In general they seek out publicity. They have a certain amount of fame, and the \"currency\" to pay for this fame is that they are expected to be \"available\" to the public in the form of media. Normal members of the public have not made this arrangement. In fact, their lack of fame makes them less appealing as a media item altogether.\n\nAnd I don't think the blurring out is all that common. I honestly usually only see the blurring out when the individuality of the person is not actually important. For example, a news segment about obesity where they film some fat guy walking out of a restaurant. It doesn't matter that it's Jim from accounting. They want to depict \"a\" fat guy. To show his face would be, let's say, humiliating, so to avoid that his face is obscured. It's almost a moot point whether he asks to be blurred out.\n\nIn terms of being \"allowed\" to request their face to be blurred out — there is no law prohibiting this, and so they have a right to do so. Even celebrities do as well. If a person whose face is not all that relevant anyway — where they are not actually part of the story — asks to be blurred out, then it is no loss to the media producers to take that action. But if a celebrity is photographed and asks the newspaper not to publish the photo, the paper will make a decision weighing the value of the media vs. making that celebrity happy. There are many people who are minor enough celebrities but sufficiently wealthy that they rarely show up in media, because the media producers know that the *cost* of publishing that media exceeds the *value* of publishing that media.\n\nMost journalists aren't bad guys and don't hate people. Many are empathic and understand how a vicious new story can have a devastating effect on people. The only journalists who don't seem that way to me are the gossip rags, and *they* only report on celebrities anyway.\n\n/u/Cosmicpowa below points out that [the legal concept of public figures plays a big role too](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2w1xzo/eli5_why_are_people_allowed_to_request_their_face/con24k2)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424099084", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My attention is divided between managing my friend's Twitch stream giveaway, and Wikii-ing.  The times will be even more askew.  Continuing from the Wi-Fi Alliance:\n\n- 1:07 PM - [Interoperability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability) was a term I came across a few times...it's exactly as it sounds: a loose term for the ability of making features, devices, corporations or groups of people work together - inter-operate.  Like you guys urging me to further my IT knowledge; we're Interoperating.  Like a well-oiled machine, my friend.  This can get gruesomely specific, let's break it down (I'm sorry if this looks dumb, I don't know how to make Reddit syntax look pretty):\n\nSyntactic interoperability - If two or more systems can community, they Syntactically Interoperate.  If you're reading this comment, your computer has Syntacically Interoperated its packets to &amp; from Reddits server.  Congratulations!  You've successfully configured your machine to Interoperate, syntactically.  WE'RE INTEROPERATING!!! *waves hands in the air*\n\nSemantic interoperability - The automatic interpretation of data &amp; information exchanged meaningfully and accurately.  Kind of like speaking to someone with broken English; it's not \"perfect information exchange\", but it makes *enough sense* to understand.  Like when someone gives you a broken URL and you fix it, throw it in your browser and the page loads; you've employed Semantic interoperation.  Grats, brohan and/or broette.\n\nCross-domain interoperability - Interoperation of one or more people or organizations striving for a common goal.  I can only guess it's vaguely related to \"ratification\", where a group or movement is \"unofficially\" representing a given cause.  Like #KONY2012; that was some cross-domain interoperability.\n\nThere's a link to Unicode here; I've never really delved into the depths of its intricacies so this seems like a nice place to go.  I hope they're nice people.\n\n- 1:19 PM - [Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) is an industry standard for consistent encoding, representation &amp; handling of text.  Exactly now Notepad only displays English-standard characters (A-Z, #'s &amp; special characters), Unicode supports funny stuff.  More than 110,000 characters, to be precise.  UTF-8 and UTF-16 (8-bit and 16-bit encoding) are the acceptable Unicode standards nowadays, which have superceded UCS-2.  UCS-2 used a 16-bit \"code unit\" (two 8-bit bytes, instead of the single 16-bit unit of UTF-16) which could not support the entire Unicode arsenal...which UTF-16 can cover by extending its ***interoperability*** to two 16-bit units (specifically 4 x 8bits) to support the additional Unicode characters.  And oh god I really hope I used interoperability correctly.  Snippet from the page: *\"In August 1988, Joe Becker published a draft proposal ... [t]he name 'Unicode' is intended to suggest a unique, unified, universal encoding\"*.\n\nNeat little tidbit of info; unique, unified, universal.  Unicode.  Bears.  Funny fact: Joe Becker speaks \"survival-level\"  Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Russian.  Dwight ain't got shit on that.  There's really nothing that appeals to me on this page....I hovered over \"8-bit bytes\" because it's phonetically pleasing, and it's apparently an \"octet\".  Heh.  *click*\n\n- 1:45 PM - An [Octet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_%28computing%29) is a unit of digital information consisting of 8 bits.  Your IP consists of four octets; 172.16.44.241 &lt;-- example quadro-octet.  Yes I just made that word up.  Snippet: *The term is often used when the term byte might be ambiguous, as historically there was no standard definition for the size of the byte.* Bytes have historically had no definition?! HOLD MY BITS, I'M GOIN' IN\n\n- 1:48 PM - A [Byte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) is a unit of digital information etc etc we've been over this...that \"*most commonly consists* of eight bits\".  Whoa hold up, most commonly?  I thought 8 bits were **required** for it to technically be a Byte.  Interest sparked.  Apparently the de-facto standard of a Byte is 8 bits, because it's conveniently a power of 2 (computer's magical number).  One Octet unit specifically denotes a sequence of 8 bits; whereas [I'm guessing] a Byte can hold *up to* 8 bits.  So....this is kind of like having an 8-sheet folder; having 5 sheets in it is still technically a folder, but if you fill that folder, it is technically correct to call it a Binder.  I hope that makes sense to you lol.  A Byte is a Byte, as long as it has at least 2 bits in it...otherwise it's just a Bit :p.  I think I'm paraphrasing here.  Byte was officially coined by Werner Bucholz during early design for the IBM Stretch.  It is intentionally \"misspelled\" from *bite* to avoid any confusion from typos regarding \"bit\".  Fun fact here: the development of 8-bit processors popularized the 8-bit storage size, and the predecessor of the Intel 8086 (x86; aka Windows 32-bit), the Intel 8008 was one of the last microprocessors that could perform small-number operations...as I understand it.  I'm 40%~ sure that could possibly might probably be incorrect; but I'm not slowing down this knowledge train.\n\nBrief pee &amp; coffee break.  Link to \"Data Hierarchy\"; sounds interesting.  Let's see who's the King and who's the Peasant.\n\n- 2:10 PM The [Data Hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_hierarchy) is basically each \"level\" of information.  A \"Database\" holds *all* the informations! --&gt; A \"File\" holds a collection of specific informations (a table of names &amp; addresses, per se), --&gt; a \"Record\" could be one line from the File; John Doe @ 123 Fake Str, --&gt; a \"Field\" would be John Doe, --&gt; \"Byte\" 0100 1010, the UTF-8 value for \"J\", --&gt; \"Bit\", the initial 0 value in the Byte value for aforementioned \"J\".  This is making way too much sense to me so clearly I must be confused.  [Image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Data_Hierarchy_diagram_showing_Employee_database_example_by_JeffTan.gif/500px-Data_Hierarchy_diagram_showing_Employee_database_example_by_JeffTan.gif) of chart I'm referencing.\n\nI'm sorry if this comment isn't as contextual or in-depth as the last one, I had to employ some crazy WPM and multitasking to handle Twitch chat (a full time job in and of itself, jebus), checking giveaway winner's credibility, etc etc.  I have excuses for days.\n\nI thank all participants in the Wikipedia AdventureTime Challenge 2015, but sadly the aforementioned friend's stream activity is picking up, and I have some RL stuff to run around and do.  I wish I had more time to sit here and spelunk through the Wikipedia's (seriously this is fun), but my free time is nigh.  Thank you again to the Wikiwarrior that golded my last comment.  \n\n*edit* brief overview: AES encryption &amp; its predecessor, cryptanalysis, Wireless security, interoperability, Unicode &amp; text standards, bits &amp; bytes and data structure.  Today we did some Wiki, and it was good.  I am very impressed with my ability to stay on-topic on Wiki.  This has never happened before.\n\n*edit2* in case anyone's wondering; approx 15,000~ characters between these 2 comments.

{"body": "Oh that's sweet! Who did that?\n\nOk so not knowing exactly what you want I'm going to post all of the artists in the area I think do good work. Some probably don't have exactly the style your looking for, but these are the guys I have saved in a folder. They all do great tattoos, with good attention to detail, and all do colour with a palette I find pleasant. Even if you don't see the exact style you're looking for these guys (and girls) all do quality tattoos and are worth taking a look at. \n\nIf you're really looking for a quality Japanese piece [Richard](http://www.richardstattoo.com/gallery.php?name=showcase&amp;gId=1) in Aberdeen is probably the best Irezumi artist in Scotland. Definitely worth the trip in my opinion.\n\nThere's a bunch of people that do good colour work with good detail. In Edinburgh you have the guys at Rock 'N Roll who are awesome across the board, [Thomas](http://rocknroll.tattoo-scotland.com/thomas-lapa-edinburgh/) in particular does some really cool stuff, really cool palette with some photo realism mixed in, There are also some Japanese tattoos in the shops gallery but I'm not sure which artist does them. You also have [Marc](http://www.stxiii.com/gallery.php?aname=marc) from Studio XIII does a little of everything neo-tribal, black and grey, [Istvan](http://www.stxiii.com/gallery.php?aname=istvan) from Studio XIII does some interesting stuff as well, [Jim](http://redhotandbluetattoo.com/artists-jim.php) from Red Hot Blue Tattoo is alright, a little hit or miss in my opinion, [Tamas](http://www.tribalbodyart.co.uk/our-artists/tamas-dikac-tattoo-artist/) at Tribal Body Art does mostly realistic stuff and portraits but his colour palette and linework is incredible, I'm sure he could work out something sweet for you, [Matt](http://www.tribalbodyart.co.uk/our-artists/tattoos-matt-curtis/) works at the same shop and has more of a traditional thing going, [Nick](http://oldtowntattoo.tumblr.com/) at Old Town Tattoo does old school flash but also some cool newer style pieces, [Krzystof Domanowski](https://www.bigtattooplanet.com/krzysztofdomanowski) at plus 48 does some really awesome stuff, including some Japanese, Flash, new-school, portraits, and a few other things, [The guys at Love Hate Tattoo are cool too](http://www.lovehatetattoo.co.uk/tattoos.html)\n\n In Glasgow you have some really sweet artists too. Rock 'N Roll tattoo is an awesome shop, I mentioned [Sile Sanda](http://rocknroll.tattoo-scotland.com/sile-sanda-glasgow/) earlier, I love his stuff, his palette is incredible, shading and linework is spot on, style is really cool and versatile, [Bart](http://rocknroll.tattoo-scotland.com/bart-glasgow/) is at the same shop and does some similar stuff], [Gary](http://www.eclecticink.co.uk/) from eclectic ink is good but so is everyone at that shop, [Cammy](http://www.otzitattoos.co.uk/tattoo-gallery/) is also pretty sweet at Otzi Tattoos, she does some really great portraits and realistic tattoos.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424567487", "subreddit": "tattoos", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
