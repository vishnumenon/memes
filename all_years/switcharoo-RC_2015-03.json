{"body": "Yeah cheating is very common in India. The thing is, India's education system is a complete mess. Not only does the entire education system revolve around examinations, the education itself is deeply flawed.\n\nRote memorization in almost every subject, no critical thinking whatsoever, outdated syllabuses, terrible teachers (they aren't paid well so usually \"good\" people don't get into teaching), and exams that are easy to \"game\". Getting \"high marks\" is all that matters, there seems to be a disinterest in the pursuit of pure knowledge. Like in a lot of places, there's a cancerous anti-intellectualism and selfish individualism that fuels most of these. Rote memorization goes to the extent of people memorizing entire essays so that they can save time on english papers.\n\nIn rural areas and lower class slum areas, the objective is to just get a passing grade. To do this they often cheat, beat up invigilators that try to stop cheating and bully them into bringing in cheat sheets, cell phones or just openly copying from other students.\n\nIn urban upper class areas, the objective is to ace exams. Nothing else matters. Since India is a populous country and seats for high-demand streams (engineering, medicine) are so few; children end up going mental in the pre-university exams. They often burn themselves out and once they get into college, they just fuck around and learn next to nothing. So outside of the final 2 pre-university years, indian education in the primary, secondary, undergraduate and postgraduate level is just utterly awful. Only in a vanishingly small minority of universities is the education even remotely acceptable by international standards. In fact Indian universities are nowhere in the international top 200 - [link](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/top-universities-best-universities-in-the-world-qs-world-ranking-iit-mit-harvard/1/309259.html). In India universities are like a brand, the actual education you get in them is usually irrelevant. Education is *always* seen as a sort of passport to a job, nothing more.\n\nPlagiarism is a completely unknown concept and the idea of original work and research in school is almost alien. Things like fudging outputs in practical exams are quite common too.\n\nFor exams there's a culture of looking at past papers extensively. What this means is that people will often memorize the sort of questions *and their answers* that tend to appear in exams, so that when they are in the exam hall, they won't even have to think. They also selectively omit major portions of the syllabus based on exam formats that let you choose between alternative questions. It's kinda funny that when the exam format changes, there's a gigantic amount of butthurt amongst the educated indian student community, because they thought they would half-ass it with this technique, and it failed.\n\nIn many colleges and schools, teaching involves a teacher just dictating \"notes\". Which are basically answers for exams. Explaining and understanding concepts is not really seen as important by most teachers. And they are often too lazy to even make the effort (and underpaid).\n\n\nThere's just so much wrong with India's education system, it's just hopeless. On top of that government spending on education is just pathetic, compared to even China. I think a lot of the problems in India have deep-seated and possibly cultural reasons for them to perpetuate.\n\nSome links : \n\n[India's renowned education system has a flip side: Ingrained cheating](http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-c1-india-cheating-20140416-m-story.html)\n\n[India's Education Woes](http://thediplomat.com/2012/02/indias-education-woes/)\n\n[Conference debates India’s education woes](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/joUemOLpkgX4vWtqMT9TFI/Conference-debates-Indias-education-woes.html)\n\n[India’s Broken Schools, Cloudy Future ](http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/indias-broken-schools-cloudy-future)\n\n[Education in India: we know the problems, what are the solutions?](http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-education-in-india-we-know-the-problems-what-are-the-solutions-1906153)\n\n[India chickens out of international students assessment programme again](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/India-chickens-out-of-international-students-assessment-programme-again/articleshow/20375670.cms)\n\n[Rote learning prevalent in top schools too](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Rote-learning-prevalent-in-top-schools-too/articleshow/15467758.cms)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426783697", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 842, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're an awesome parent for supporting your son's newfound hobby and making sure he can experience it in the cleanest manner possible. Hopefully we'll be able to be of some help.\n\n&gt; how old are most people on pony forums like this one?\n\nThe median is around college age, so mostly 21 and around. I'm towards the higher end at 24. Some of the people on this forum lean a little younger, between 16 and 21.\n\n&gt; there is a side of MLP fandom that isn't kid safe at all. Can you tell me: which websites are best avoided\n\nAs always, you should be present as much as possible whenever your son decides to browse the internet.\n\nIt's gonna be hard to filter, but my first and probably most helpful piece of advice is always to turn Google SafeSearch on for any computer he might use. It'll be on by default, but [just make sure the checkbox is checked.](http://puu.sh/gJgeN/8e048f8a47.jpg)\n\n**Official places will be your best bet, since your son can see all sorts of cool and curated pony stuff without potentially interacting with anyone dangerous.**\n\nNaturally, you can never go wrong with the official website (www.MyLittlePony.com), which has all sorts of fun games, coloring books, pictures, and videos. Since it's the official website, it's *heavily* curated by Hasbro staff, so you will be *guaranteed* to never see questionable content.\n\nNetflix is definitely a safe place; every episode from seasons 1 to 4 is on there, as well as both of the movies. You could even make a dedicated \"family time\" where everyone watches an episode every night! It also has two documentaries, \"A Brony Tale\" (starring Applejack/Rainbow Dash's voice actress, Andrea Libman) and \"Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony\" (starring the creator, the voice of Discord, and the voice of Twilight Sparkle), both of which will do an excellent job of introducing you to the fandom and all the cool stuff the bronies have done.\n\n**When it comes to fan content, however...**\n\nIt will be hard for your son to interact with other My Little Pony fans over the internet, since most internet users are adults and will have fewer filters. I would be cautious allowing him access to sites where other fans congregate.\n\nThere are lots of cool videos on YouTube, but some of them might be vulgar or extremely bizarre, and YouTube doesn't do a very good job of hiding that content. I suggest looking up Pony on YouTube with a certain degree of caution... but you will find some [*really* cool stuff there too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQSz6gKdhO8&amp;list=PLolHJJPrl4fGiUwRlJfoR1S5xaTfFm9KI).\n\nEquestria Daily (http://www.equestriadaily.com) is a great place to find out news regarding the fandom and the show. It does not ever post mature content at all, but its comments sections are frequented by fans. As long as you keep him out of the comments section\n\nDerpibooru (http://www.derpibooru.org) is a site that shares hundreds of thousands of MLP pictures and art made by fans. It has filters that you can set up so that your son *never* gets exposed to explicit content, including a TV-Y mode. These filters are on by default, so you can peruse it if you want to look at cool pictures with your son. I'd advise against letting him browse alone, however, since they're easy to turn off.\n\nFimfiction (http://www.fimfiction.net) is a site for fans to write and post fanfiction. It has a mature toggle that hides mature content, but unfortunately it's very easy to turn off. It'll best be browsed with parental supervision, or potentially not at all until your son is a teenager (which means he might not even be a fan of the show anymore by then).\n\n**If you want to try and keep your son off the internet...**\n\nThe [official comics](http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Omnibus-1/dp/1631401408/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426934436&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=my+little+pony+idw) are fantastic from both a story and art perspective, and they will keep your son (and you and your husband too!) very entertained.\n\nThere are also [chapter books](http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Twilight-Sparkle/dp/0316228192/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426934470&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=my+little+pony+books) that will help your son learn to read. Many are offered at various reading levels, so you can gradually wean your son on bigger and more complex books over time.\n\nThere's also an official My Little Pony game for Android, iPhone/iPod/iPad, and Windows Phone, and all sorts of official audiobooks that your son can read along with as well.

{"body": "I'm baking bread so I'm gonna be in and out!\n\nThe International Medical Council on Vaccination is a anti-vaccination group promoting the anti-vaccination agenda (they publish a lot on sites like Natural News, to boot). [They've been active for a little while apparently](http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html) \n\nBut let's not just take some guy's word for it, because we're analytical motherfuckers, yeah?\n\nI googled them and found a LinkedIn page for them, this is a good sign. I've worked with a lot of nonprofits over the years and networking is vital to raising funds and keeping your nonprofit alive.\n\n[But their LinkedIn page is blank and they only have one employee listed on LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-medical-council-on-vaccination) None of the doctors listed on the site are associated with the organization, which is an enormous red flag. Networking is big for doctors and clinicians, they want their names on as many prestigous things as they can get, it makes them look good when applying for grants and the like (and there are anti-vax research grants up for grabs!) [The website linked on their webpage as their official portal is an abandoned blank placeholder.](http://www.imcv.info/)\n\nWell not everyone is on LinkedIn, right? The LinkedIn page gives us a zipcode that is linked to Racine Wisconsin, let's check it out and see if we can find their headquarters. A lot of nonprofits end up in little stripmalls and everything so it's not a red flag if we find some shitty storefront, that's just how these things go sometimes. [Here's where I googled it to find information so you can follow along too](https://www.google.com/search?q=53405&amp;rlz=1C1GIWA_enUS624US624&amp;oq=53405&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22International+Medical+Council+on+Vaccination%22+racine+wisconsin)\n\nThe first link that turns up is to a [Dr Michael Berglund](https://www.facebook.com/drberglund)! Alright! A medical professional associated with the nonprofit actually exists, this is a good sign! And then you look at his page and he talks about fluoridation being a bad thing and lowering IQ and other quack shit. Fuck.\n\nWell, let's look for other people related to this organization. One quack in the bunch doesn't mean they're all quacks, right? He might just be the one that slid in under the radar, it happens in every organization. Oh wait, he's not a doctor at all, he's a chiropractor. Goddammit. \n\nOkay, let's keep searching.\n\nAlright, found someone else associated with that organization! This is good. [Oh shit, it's someone that lists themselves as being a graduate of the \"National College of Midwifery a few years back\".](https://www.facebook.com/MidwifeLaNette) Crap. \n\nOkay, let's keep searching.\n\n[See that link at the bottom with the IP Address and it's a WHOIS site? Let's check this shit out, for science.](http://www.websitelooker.net/ip/216.172.162.212)\n\nFuck it shouldn't take this much work to figure out stuff about a nonprofit. [The same IP hosting an anti-vax site is also hosting a church and a doctor's website, looks promising, let's check that shit out.](http://drsuzanne.net/) Alright! An actual doctor! Ehh... \"Medical training\"? \"Participant in the conventional system from 1989 until 2011\"? 2011 is about the time when news articles about the International Medical Council on Vaccination really started popping up. Alright, we're on the right track here, fucking finally. And it's the same Dr Suzanne that wrote that article! Rocking!\n\nSo I'm scanning her site and seeing a lot of the usual homeopathic woo-woo that I usually do on these kinds of sites. I see she gave a talk to something called ABF Sweden, so I click on the [Vimeo link for the lecture](https://vimeo.com/113144579) Alright, let's see what Dr. Suzanne is all about, because I'm not going to take some asshole's word for it that she doesn't know what's what. Right off the bat she starts talking about \"Allopathy\" which is apparently heavily related to homeopathy. Not looking so great, Dr. Suzanne. \n\n[Let's check out her CV to see what her qualifications are on her website](http://drsuzanne.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/CV-11.5.21031.pdf) She let one of her licenses lapse in 2007, and her other one will lapse soon too. She's also [selling a book](http://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Illusions-Disease-Vaccines-Forgotten/dp/1480216895) but that's to be expected, she's a doctor on the anti-vax front of course she'd have a book.\n\nSix loaves of bread later and we've finally gotten somewhere.\n\nMost of what I'm seeing here is standard rhetorical and copywriting tricks. Borrowing credibility from PhDs in physics, cross linking stuff that may or may not be weakly related, using deceptive language (i.e. \"medically trained\", \"allopathy\", \"vitamin C can cure everything\", etc. etc.) Lots of emotional pleading too, especially in the vaccine article on her page. \n\nIt really sucks that you have to plow this deep into sources to figure out people's angle to see what lens they're presenting the data through. I couldn't find any other people connected to the organization, but it looks like anti-vaxxers use this website for a lot of their facts and it's not even updated all that often. From the information I pulled in the last hour it looks like the International Medical Council on Vaccination is headed by a doctor that no longer practices conventional medicine started to lose interest 8 years ago at the very least. The only people I could find associated with the organization currently is a midwife and a chiropractor that believes fluoridation causes retardation (I live on top of a naturally fluoridated water supply, I'm not retarded but I do have yellow teeth from it). \n\nHer website has a testimonials page, which is very strange for a doctor, but not strange for an alternative therapy practitioner. The top testimonial talks about how the \"doctor\" cured her baby of whooping cough with Vitamin C shots. Holy mother of fuck.\n\nTLDR; Spent an hour? doing research, found out how deep the rabbit hole truly goes. That doctor isn't really a doctor, and the International Medical Council on Vaccination seems to be as international as Racine, Wisconsin is cosmopolitan. Doctor is selling a book and massive Vitamin C injections, believes that people don't need antibiotics to cure massive bacterial infections, and other insanity.
