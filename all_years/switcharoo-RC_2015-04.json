And yet again we see people with no investment in games, just like most of GG's figureheads (Milo, Cernovich, Sargon, etc), jumping on a moron's bandwagon to get in some cheap shots at people or concepts for simple, petty revenge.\nReally, him and gamergate deserve each other.

{"body": "I have eyes that [fold in too](http://i.imgur.com/E93r910.jpg). T.T\n\nSo here's the tricks I discovered:\n\n* Use your eye make up with your eyes open to make sure they show up\n* Mascara that coats your lashes in little \"tubes\" are the best for avoiding smudging. I personally use Imju's Fiberwig mascara as a \"top coat\" (since it doesn't do much for length/volume) over other mascaras to make them smudge-proof &amp; water-proof.\n* It's ok to go really thick on the eye make up. It doesn't really show up when you open your eyes and still look like a no make up make up look. Here's an example of a look with [my eyes open](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VerG3_KUr84/VP3XSo17QII/AAAAAAAADK0/78O2D319_nk/s1600/IMG_5574.jpg), and how it looks like with [my eyes closed](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kLnh0lZ3o6E/VP3XTJZ_KeI/AAAAAAAADK4/javc88B3HLU/s1600/IMG_5584.jpg).\n* You can also play with just the sides and letting your eyeliner only peek out from the sides [like this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yQ2eDrL6DPI/VO6mTGx6WQI/AAAAAAAADAI/V_rNUkt3m-c/s1600/FullSizeRender_1.jpg)\n* A smoky eye can also look very \"no make up\" on monolids. [Here's](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-abSf57ZBu24/VPezEVvS_DI/AAAAAAAADHA/7t1zdIqOKzg/s1600/IMG_5216.jpg) an example (excuse the brows...I was swatching Dipbrow and had to show the difference)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428206669", "subreddit": "MakeupAddictionAsia", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey, my father is from Norway (Larkollen, specifically), where in Norway are you from?\n\nI saw elsewhere in this thread that you like hiking and judging by my hiking experiences in Norway (Besseggen was terrifying), you're probably pretty decent at it.   I don't know if there's anything more specific to LA than being able to experience the mountains and the beach in the same day, so I'd try to hike up in the San Gabriel Mountains, then head down to the beach afterwards to hang out/have dinner.   Not sure how long of a hike you'd want to do, but Santa Anita Canyon, Echo Mountain, Mt. Baldy, and Icehouse Canyon are all great hikes.\n\nAlso, you can get around pretty easily with Metro transit, especially by taking one of the train lines, and it's not particularly expensive.      Maybe just pick a spot along one of the lines that you want to explore and take the train there for the day.\n\nOh, another interesting thing on the hiking front that many people know about but doesn't show up on any of the tourist guides - there's a canyon near the coast called Rustic Canyon that has the ruins of an old Nazi-sympathizer compound called Murphy Ranch.   It's got an [interesting history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_Ranch) and is worth checking out.    There's also the [abandoned old LA Zoo](http://laist.com/2012/06/19/photos_exploring_the_eerie_old_la_z.php) in Griffith Park.\n\nAt any rate, one of the things that makes Los Angeles really great is that there are so many parts of it that there's no one \"real LA\" experience (except getting stuck in traffic).

{"body": "The best system for player housing I have seen was in a game called Fallen Earth, which was created by a bunch of ex Star Wars Galaxy devs who left after the NGE. Fallen Earth was a clone of Fallout 3, except as an mmo. Which means - Fallen Earth was \"Oblivion with guns\". Which means, it was basically \"Elder Scrolls Online, with guns.\" Everything about the game was oblivion-like, even some of the underlying technology, such as speed tree, which led to not only the gameplay feeling like elder scrolls, but also the game [looking like elder scrolls too](http://i1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc428/xhrit/Fallen%20Earth/image132.jpg~original).\n\nAnyway, the player housing in FE was part of a system called \"progress towns\". There was a craft skill line called construction. Anyone could craft a building and put it anywhere in any progress town. Wood, stone, metal, structures, a bunch of different (racial) styles, with a bunch of different features. Not just houses - farms/mills/mines, stores, stables, crafting stations, guard posts/towers, training dummies, campfires, walls. Higher level buildings are bigger, and have more features.\n\nYou deploy the buildings the same way you deploy a siege weapon. You can put them anywhere inside the progress town - there were several different progress towns in several different zones. (lowbie progress towns, epic endgame progress town, etc.) Once a building is deployed at a town, you can go inside, and use the services offered there, but you can't pack it up unless it is a mobile structure like a tent. You can repair buildings that are damaged or salvage them for some of the materials.\n\nEvery few hours, there is a chance for a NPC army to attack the town. Buildings can be destroyed by mobs, and if the whole town is destroyed, the town's ruins are inhabited by monsters, and must be cleared out before any buildings can be placed again.\n\nThe trick then, was balancing the number of defensive structures with the number of farms. the more farms, the more materials a player can harvest, but if the players don't allocate enough space in the town to defensive structures, and the town was attacked during the middle of the night when no players were on, it would be destroyed. It was a mix of player housing, city planning, tower defense, and arena raid style fights against waves of mobs.\n\nGuilds would band together to run towns, the raids were excellent exp, and the farms were the best source of crafting materials. It was hands down the most compelling activity in the game.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428515746", "subreddit": "elderscrollsonline", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                     I hate you so much. But I respect that.

{"body": "I'll put some more on the imgur and let you know. For me, it was all about using the headers and plastic header-spacers to keep everything in place while I soldered. It's two pieces: the OSH Park brushed board and the custom prototyping board breakout.\n\nI put together the OSH Park board ([benedikt shows how easy this can be](https://vimeo.com/100064135). I'm using an smd station I got from the LAShop.com, I can't seem to find the one I have [but this one has a soldering iron too](http://www.thelashop.com/hot-air-smd-bga-lead-free-rework-solder-desolder-station.html), really wish they had that when I was shopping).\n\nThen I soldered the headers to the prototyping board, after placing and snipping the mosfet header connections to touch the drain pads. I used right angle headers through the signal on the OSH park board to the positive pins on the motors; set a positive power rail attaching them all with the li-po; then I snipped the excess right angle headers pins off and attached the motor connectors. The right angle pins through the signal connections on the OSH Park board were to help make sure the right angle pins for the mosfet connections and li-po connections on the  to the breakout where lined up properly before soldering them. The negative motor terminals are only soldered to the motor/li-po breakout to make sure they are secure.\n\nThen, I could solder the afro mini headers to the OSH park board and snip the signals so they don't touch the positive battery terminals on the motor/Li-Po breakout (I put a small piece of electrical tape there for safety). \n\nFinally, I soldered the brushed module pieces together. I positioned the right angle headers from the motor/Li-Po breakout to the mosfets and OSH Park Li-Po connections (using plastic header spacers on the opposite side of the solder work like before to secure it in place). I soldered the battery terminals first for security, then I dripped soldering paste down the vertical part of the right angle mosfet headers after slightly heating them and shot the air downwards on the vertical part of the right angle mosfet header until it merged with the mosfet drain pad.\n\nThen is was a matter of placing the module on the afro mini board and making sure to enable cam servo so the s1-4 signals are used.\n\nGood Luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428957998", "subreddit": "Multicopter", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't even think Awoo means anything necessarily &gt;.&lt;\n\nCool then. Prep yourself cos this post is massive. Also I highly prefer girl groups, but you can find some of the boys at the bottom of the post. &gt;.&lt;\n\nI'm a massive T-ara fangirl so listen to this [Absolute First Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=361hFoDibio) + the two songs that came with the repackage. [IGCBOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d70FQdraoYI) &amp; [I'm really hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NobleBtJNiQ)\nThis is pure unadulterated ~~somewhat electronic but not really~~ pop. Reminds me of Britney Spears a lot. I'd recommend listening to I'm really Hurt first and then IGCBOY to get a feel for it and then dive into the album, because I really like it, but I have weird taste. On of my other favourite groups is EXID with some of the catchiest stuff outside of T-ara - [Wi Arae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfXZ6ydgZyo) and [Ah Yeah!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqDPipqIAg). \n\nKpop is a very interesting genre in that it actively pushes people to get highly involved with the band members and know their personalities (which is why if you come across T-ara hate it's kinda hilarious because it's a 3 year long grudge, blah blah). It's a shit industry, not gonna lie there, but it's also really selling a complete package you can get invested in. EXID is lucky in that they have (sorry Junghwa and Hyerin) three aces who will take them to the top. Solji is an intense singer, Hani is a dorky, lovable, beautiful girl and LE composes a lot of music. Songs like [Troublemaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-zRAQmKUkI) Which was HYPER popular. Which brings me to Miryo, one of the other idols in the industry known especially for her composing work, she's part of Brown Eyed Girls.\n\n[Brown Eyed Girls - Sixth Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIqkDBsSJOw) &amp; [Abracadabra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwFr8o8p0Y) - both are incredibly classic songs, also very heavy on the autotune, but that's half their style. As is the solo work that came from one of their members, [Gain - Paradise Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i32ANEa5mk)\nYou may also recognize her as the girl in Psy's Gentlemen MV, and that's also why you might be reminded of Gentlemen when you listen to Abracadabra. Gentlemen was a lovely homage lol. \n\nEasily one of 2ne1's best songs, [I am the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o). You've probably heard it in a Microsoft ad. Album to go for would be either their first album To Anyone, or their latest album Crush. Member CL had this song on the album, [MTBD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LnzDTaCDk) - she'll be around the US a lot soon because she is hanging out with Diplo and recently signed with Scooter Braun in an attempt to break into the US market. Probably the best attempt yet. \n\nThough Wonder Girls managed a tiny bit of acclaim in 2009 with [Nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA7fdSkp8ds). That's the English version, but the Korean Version is known as one of their greatest songs, along with [Be My Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fy4cqWMhyI), [Tell Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlHv3BbBv6A), [So Hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmun5PO54VE) and [Irony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxFxoLxmcdg). \n\nRIP to the Wonder Girls, in name they still exist but half the members are gone. Thankfully on to do some excellent things! [Sunmi - 24 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UmDrsMlXXg) \n&amp; [Hat:felt (aka Yenny/Yeeun)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQT82EOXX7c)\n\nThe absolute legend of the Industry (female wise) is Girls' Generation. You will likely know [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ). They are/were known for very elegant, innocent charms. [This is one of their other famous songs, mostly for being a clusterfuck, although it does grow on you, my bf just said he likes it a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E). You will definitely come across a lot of their fans (sones) if you are hanging around the kpop part of the internet. \n\nTheir most famous sister groups (same company) are f(x) and Red Velvet. \n\nf(x) has been around since 2009 and are known for their quirky brand of pop. [Electric Shock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8I8QGFA1oM), [Red Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv-8-EgPEY0) and [Beautiful Stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAYiH7ov5Ac) are pretty good representations of their music. \n\nRed Velvet hasn't been around long, but already have left us with gems such as [Ice Cream Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glXgSSOKlls) and [Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px2Q47O0_eE). \n\nAlthough, when it comes to most listenable currently, I am in love with After School. [Shampoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OSmITtaX3o), [Because of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nTVjsi18OU), [Flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IKUhydr_8) and others are great reasons to listen to them. But my favourite are their relaxed Japanese releases. (A lot of Kpop groups also make money by promoting in Japan.) [Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vud2PRhmKSM),[Shh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzT-QIlhqY0),[The entire Dress to Kill album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koZu0sDf5Qs&amp;list=PLNzbZkBDeQvvKLJXNxRcKQGnGdoksKCwd)\n\nOther massive girl groups I can't really segue into are:\n\n[Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqvdj0Fl_MY)\n\n[Kara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7TYiyEhxdI) - possibly one of my favourite ever songs.\n\n[Dal Shabet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGKeA3xUzxU) - who really have no qualms about being sexually blatant, but also confusing as possible. \n\n[9Muses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwN_Axs7pL4)\n\n[Girl's Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB4dQcxgJPY)\n\n[APink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dVjSvLzD1I)\n\n[Sistar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ZHXVp_wUE)\n\n[AOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEYOyZVWlzs)\n\n[Rania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYvC6TmJql0) - totally underrated composing of a song really.\n\n[After School's crazy subunit - ie. just members Lizzy, Nana and Raina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqSF_9Zf0n4)\n\n[Secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpatVVhT-Io)\n\n[Miss A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO9RzrhYR-I)\n\n[15&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pjuHcP5hsM)\n\n[Spica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc1RwpRfbT0)\n\nI am missing a LOT of groups I can tell you that. In fact, I don't even have any male groups (not much co-ed except [Akdong Musician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oi8jDMvd_w) and a couple of other random groups.) I can give you a quick list though. \n\n[Big Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU), [TVXQ/DBSK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJS32n6LNQ), [Super Junior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6TwzSGYycM), [Shinee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhxjEXDAy6s), [Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAzWT8mRoR0), [2pm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwD51VS0Uko), [SPEED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOlBheJB3ww), [Infinite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTXmhKapmCI) and many more. Here's also a link to [EXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dezFzsNss), because they are the boy band of the moment currently, while Big Bang hasn't released anything in a while.\n\n\nRight, now that I've overloaded you with information, lemme know which songs you actually liked and I can get even (shamefully) deeper into kpop for you if you'd like. [Here's a really good song though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-0ctk5l5zA)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429792975", "subreddit": "kpop", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Growing up with them, most people who were really into the band knew that Dickey's playing was as integral to the band as Duane's, and often more melodic.  Duane wrote only one song on his own before his death, \"Little Martha\", but even there, you can hear Dickey's country influence.  They both play on that song and it is heavily country, something that Duane wasn't playing much, but Dickey was.  Dickey was also into psychedelic music before Duane, and that was why Duane tried to talk Dickey's bass player into leaving Dickey and heading out as a trio with Duane. He wanted to do what Dickey was doing, but could not make it work.  Duane and Berry Oakley were only out for a short while, because Duane wasn't yet up to it.

{"body": "I cannot stress enough that I have absolutely no proof behind this, and it's based entirely off of conjecture, but: \n\n**TL;DR:** I believe that Joe Paterno did not die when he supposedly did. \n\nJoe Paterno was a man who was known to be the moral bastion of the college football world. While other programs were going on probation for violations of all kinds of rules, Paterno did not even have a recruiting violation on his record. He was viewed as a father figure by not only his players, but also by the entire Penn State Community. And then, the Sex Abuse Scandal all of a sudden came to light. \n\nFor those of you who didn't turn on CNN, ESPN, or any other 24 hour news station at any point during November 2011 to January 2012, Jerry Sandusky, one of Paterno's longtime assistant coaches, was arrested on the charges of molesting almost a dozen boys during his tenure at Penn State. In 2002, Mike McQueary caught Jerry Sandusky engaging in anal rape in the showers of the Penn State locker room with a boy. McQueary told Joe Paterno, and other University officials about the incident. [He claims to have told the police too](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/15/sports/la-sp-penn-state-20111116). Anyway, now that Paterno knew, what did he say? He went to his higher ups, but NOT THE POLICE. After this, Sandusky was banned from bringing any boys onto the Penn State campus. That basically means that campus higher ups KNEW that Sandusky was a predator to young boys, but did not report anything to the police. Why? Well, to protect their reputation as the moral highground of college football. \n\nNovember 2011 all of this came to light. People were outraged at Sandusky for molesting the boys, sure. But the thing that CNN and ESPN latched onto was the fact that Paterno did not report this to the police and was involved in the massive coverup. News cameras were put up outside of Joe Paterno's house, and students protested the placement of a statue outside of the stadium on campus. I'll never forget the 30 minute segment ESPN ran about the statue. Anyway, Penn State soon realized that the main story of this horrible scandal was not, sadly, the abuse itself, but the fact that Paterno had been the coverup. So what happens? Paterno develops lung cancer very quickly after he was fired from his Head coaching position, and dies two months later. \n\nAm I the only one who finds at, at the very least, a little suspicious? He just so happens to get cancer in the midst of all of this, and when he dies two months later the story almost instantly goes away, and doesn't get mentioned until the trial began in June 2012? This whole story has so many dimensions to it. In addition, consider the [Disappearance of Ray Gricar in 2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Gricar#Disappearance). He was a DA who chose to not press charges against Sandusky in *1998*. Seven years later he goes missing, and six years after that Sandusky is arrested. A bit suspicious right? I don't know. Maybe someone else can better connect these event. But something is not right, and although the proof is not there, it sure seems like something's odd about this whole thing.

Besides, I don't see your point. How does having the words \"POLICE\" embroidered on their vests make them less militarized? They're still way better equipped than the SOBR officers in the OP, and alot of their gear is *actual military issue.*\n\nAnd yes, I'm well aware of the fact that they use old BTRs. The only difference between those and the MRAPS/armored cars S.W.A.T uses is the machine gun on the turret, which again, is completely necessary because of the threats SOBR faces.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand what you expect. The guys in the OP are equipped in an extremely bare bones fashion. Outdated helmets, old ballistic vests, some mag pouches, mix matched camo fatigues, and barebones AKs.
