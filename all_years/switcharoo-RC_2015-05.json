{"body": "Hey there! \n\nSorry in advance for the wall!\n\n&gt; I'm pretty unfamiliar with tattoo shops in Ottawa\n\nTo start, [here's a list of threads about tattoos](http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/search?q=tattoo&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) in /r/Ottawa. There's lots of threads that you can look into, and you can even sort them by date, to see the most recent reviews. \n\nSecondly, [here's a list of threads of tattoos from Ottawa](http://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/search?q=ottawa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) from /r/Tattoos. I would take this into great consideration because /r/tattoos was made to showcase extremely well done tattoos (also, it shows you which shops and artists to just plain avoid..)\n\nWe've also got a few shops here [dans la belle province](http://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/search?q=gatineau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), worth [looking them up](https://www.google.ca/maps/search/tattoo+gatineau/@45.4367362,-75.6736182,12z).\n\nThere's also lots of tattoo parlors that are within walking distance of each other! On Rideau street alone, there are five parlors very close to each other ([Tattoos Etc](https://plus.google.com/101875752616234411967/about?gl=ca&amp;hl=en), [Silverline Tattoo](http://www.silverlinetattoo.net/), [Universal Tattoo](http://universaltattoo.org/), [Living Colour Tattoo](http://www.living-colour.com/), [Planet Ink](http://www.planetinkottawatattoo.com/), and maybe [Future Skin Tattoo](http://futureskin.com/) if you like walking).\n\n\n&gt;is there any places that have specific walk-in dates or times?\n\n\nA lot of parlors update their twitter and Facebook for when they have time for walk-ins and drop-ins, [Planet Ink,](https://twitter.com/ottawaplanetink/status/590936543600254977) for example. So, keep an eye out on the social media accounts of the parlors you like! \n\nI mention these shops in particular, because much like yourself, I had a friend who spontaneously decided to get a tattoo. She walked into each parlor (the five I mentioned above), and asked them if they took walk-ins, and their rates. At the time, most of them accepted walk-ins, and were willing to tattoo her then and there (it was for a smallish-medium sized tattoo, about a decametre, b&amp;w, and came out to $150-$250 depending on the place). This was done at [Silverline Tattoo](http://www.silverlinetattoo.net/) (she had a great experience there!). \n\nJust by looking online, it seems like the most sought-after shops are [New Moon](http://newmoontattoo.com/) (their site says drops ins are welcome), [Five Cents](https://plus.google.com/100823802272400963855/about?gl=ca&amp;hl=en) (their normal site is broken, so I have no idea what their drop in policy is), and [Barnstormer Studio](http://barnstormerstudio.ca/) (wouldn't count on them for drop ins; [they're notorious for not even honouring appointments](http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/2e658e/barnstormer_studioottawa/))\n\nHope some of this helps!

{"body": "Not my pictures of course, they're just the best ones I could find online.\n\nThis is apparently a reissue of a vintage watch, but I don't know the reference.\n\nThe cool thing about the watch is that the crystal is multi-layered, with the tachymeter indices and the numbers printed on the inside of the crystal, so you get this cool 3D effect. Of course, the downside is if you ever get that crystal damaged, seems like you'd be up a certain creek without a paddle. I also really like just how recessed the dial is.\n\nThis would be an instant buy for me if it were mechanical but I suppose if it were it'd be 2 foot thick.

Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked.\n\nA continued sexual \"relationship\" lasted for ten more years as she recounts\n\n&gt;As she grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a “motorcycle chick.” Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just “relax on me.” Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying.”\n“I shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out\n\nDid she not molest her sister?

{"body": "[Ozaroo](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/11743-ozaru_dbz.jpg)- Iconic Saiyan transformation. Played a large role in the beginning, kinda wish it would have played more of a role later, pretty useless in the current series. \n\n[False SSJ](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/d/d0/FalseSSJGoku2.png/revision/latest?cb=20110628043615)- I honestly thought this was pretty cool. It's not canon as far as I know but it was really cool to see what happens when a saiyan powers up to a SSJ while lacking the full ability to unlock SSJ. \n\n[SSJ](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/2/22/GokuSuperSaiyanVsCooler.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width/280?cb=20120620232809)- Iconic transformation of Dragon Ball Z. Much of the series is building up to this transformation. Well designed, and shows a lot of versatility. It has few different sub version such as Ultra SSJ. I really like this form and it seems like it's going to be the main emphasis in the future series. While it lacks for crazy power it's much more sustainable, which seems to be a major theme for future episodes.  \n\n[SSJ 2](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/8/8b/Goku_SSJ2_Electric.png/revision/latest?cb=20110824130849&amp;path-prefix=es)- My favorite looking form. Teen gohan looked amazing in this form and I honestly thought Goku and Vegeta also look very cool. The sparks, the increased aura, the stiffer hair, and the increased muscle all look amazing to me. Kinda becomes useless however due to energy consumption and being outclassed by stronger enemies. \n\n[SSJ 3](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dsby9f5RVN8/maxresdefault.jpg)- I know this is unpopular but my least favorite of the SSJ transformations. I never really liked the way it looked sans eye brows. I never understood why Goku's hair got that long. It's also completely useless due to being outclassed and using way too much energy. \n\n[Golden Ozaroo](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/d/d8/GokuGreatApeDBGT.png/revision/latest?cb=20091208101442)- a Gt invention. It's got a lot of potential but is never really explained, so like much of gt, it falls flat. Never plays much of a role. \n\n[SSJ 4](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/056/6/6/goku_ssj4_by_renderdragonball-d4qy24d.png)- I love SSJ 4. I really do. However, it's lack of canonicity sorta dulls it a bit for me. It's arguably the coolest looking form and with some of the fan theories on it, it had so much potential. The primal look to it just makes me think of the saiyan heritage much more than SSJ god. I would've loved seeing it implemented as the \"true\" SSJ ultimate form ;however, that doesn't seem to be the future plan. As it is, SSJ 4 is nonexistent and basically worthless.\n\n[SSJ God](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111137856/3516360-3087015-4408324517-29534.png)- I know this is the future of the series, but I'm just not a huge fan. I don't hate it necessarily, I just didn't really like the method to obtain it. I just like SSJ 4 so much more in terms of design. I suppose I'll have to accept it however. \n\n[SSGSSJ](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySzghWd2NXo/maxresdefault.jpg)- I don't know enough about it as the new movie hasn't come out. I will say I'm slightly disappointed that Golden Frieza is supposedly stronger than this form. I'm also not too crazy about it's design. It's not terribly but it's a bit smurfy.

{"body": "&gt; The solution is not to prevent the cartoon, but to foster a society where no one would think violence is the appropriate response to a cartoon. \n\nSee, I think you've partly missed what I was trying to say. You said \n\n&gt; I don't disagree about the reasonableness of wanting to prevent communal violence, but limiting speech doesn't protect people from violence\n\nThis means that there would be no link between communal violence and free speech. To contradict that, I made the observation that in *at least the case that I gave*, limiting speech would have protected people from violence. \n\nYou've instead replied on why free speech logically shouldn't cause violence in societies with ample free speech. I really think examples might help this discussion a lot, rather than you saying \"basic logic\" as a reason. Human behaviour in general isn't always logical. \n\n&gt; Look at the rates of violence in places with robust protections on free speech vs the rest of the world. \n\nI'm going to say that I don't agree with this comparison because a lot of things affect crime rate, rather than \"free speech\". But if you want to go with this point:\n\n* [China vs US - US has higher rates of violence](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/China/United-States/Crime).\n\n* [France vs US - US has higher rates of violence. I compared this because France has laws against hate speech; US has comparatively greater free speech](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/France/United-States/Crime)\n\n* [Germany vs US - US has higher rates of violence; US also has comparatively freer speech as Germany has holocaust denial laws](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Germany/United-States/Crime)\n\nI brought up Niger earlier, so here is [Niger vs US - oh. US has higher violent crime rates too](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Niger/United-States/Crime).\n\nSo your comparison doesn't work.\n\n&gt; Where you have censorship of ideas, the ideas don't go away, they only foment. This is akin to being against STD's and early pregnancies and thinking that the solution is to prevent discussions of sex. \n\n1. I don't agree with that comparison.\n2. But since we're making use of academic references, I suggest Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech by Cass Sunstein.\n3. This issue could be a whole book, and there are academics on either side of the debate! \n\n&gt; authorities should counter hateful ideas through public debate\n\nDo you actually think that works? Let's just talk about ideas. Eva Cosse presumes that a society should be able to recognise and discard the factual errors/misinformation. That's true in an ideal society. But then consider that [24% of Americans believe that Obama was not born in America](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-one-in-four-americans-think-obama-was-not-born-in-us/), even though he's shown them his birth certificate and all. That's not a logical belief. That's a piece of misinformation that has been countered multiple times by that point.\n\nThat's humanity for you. Public discourse doesn't always help.

But like all the others, I watched it without knowing the plot for maximum effect.\n\nSo for the first 30-40 minutes, it was pretty cool - a guy gets assigned to take care of the boss's girl, follows her around, etc. And then about halfway through, he's suddenly hanging from a hook, bruised and bloodied, beaten to within an inch of his life, hand broken, *buried alive* (at this point I was seriously wondering where this film was gonna go because every time I expected a rescue or an escape, it never came). Even when he climbed out of the muddy grave, miraculously, the gangsters are still right there, waiting for him, clapping and only marginally impressed.\n\nSo they've thoroughly demonstrated that this is a protagonist who isn't immune to dying and despite being a badass, clearly can be killed by his friends and bosses at a moment's notice. They've pretty much broken him down. He's making that phone call, asking for mercy from his boss, and I have no clue where this movie is gonna go from now. But I'm hooked.\n\n*And then* his friend takes the phone back and sees there's no battery. I'm thinking, no way, what...is he really going to...? And then he DOES, he hits his friend's face with the battery, he picks up a brick and smashes through several guys in a row, he just goes and absolutely WRECKS their shit despite everyone, including myself, thoroughly believing he was beaten down and done for.\n\nI'd say it's my favorite \"comeback\" scene in any movie because of how they played with my expectations and emotions. But it was only possible because I hadn't seen any trailers or anything, I didn't know it was going to turn into a revenge action film. I saw one trailer afterwards and it spoiled this whole aspect of the film, so I'm glad I went in blind.\n\nEDIT: [I fucking love the whole ending climax too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1YIEO-ZVew), despite being rather violent, it couldn't have oozed more style if they tried.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431971703", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "So much to do. Hard to know where to start, but I'll give it a shot.\n\n* For bars I would recommend Downtown as someplace that has completely changed since the last time you saw it. Check out [Perch](https://www.google.com/search?q=perch+los+angeles+ca&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PCdaVZbEBIKJoQTh6YHQCQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=perch+los+angeles) and the [Ace Hotel](https://www.google.com/search?q=perch+los+angeles+ca&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PCdaVZbEBIKJoQTh6YHQCQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=ace+hotel+los+angeles+rooftop+bar) for rooftop views. But be warned those places get packed with long lines after about 9pm Thurs-Sat. There are a ton of other bars walking distance though, hard to go wrong, a lot of stuff is really fun, just don't walk east of Los Angeles street which is still skid row. But you can barhop around and maybe take the subway back to where you are staying. I recommend staying in Koreatown at the [Line Hotel](https://www.google.com/search?q=perch+los+angeles+ca&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PCdaVZbEBIKJoQTh6YHQCQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=line+hotel+koreatown) for about $350/night, or Hotel Normandie around the corner for $175. While in Koreatown have some fun there, get some bbq or go to the many karaoke bars like Brass Monkey, or soju joints like Dan Sung Sa, or velvet rope places like Lock &amp; Key. Silverlake is a lot of fun too, an easy thing to do is just go to Sunset Junction, and check out the various bars within a couple blocks. I'd recommend Black Cat, [Bar Stella](https://www.google.com/search?q=bar+stella+silverlake&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yylaVY-YBMqrogSEjYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768), Cliff's Edge, or [4100](https://www.google.com/search?q=bar+stella+silverlake&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yylaVY-YBMqrogSEjYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=4100+silverlake) for a dive bar. Other great bars in Silverlake are [Edendale](https://www.google.com/search?q=bar+stella+silverlake&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yylaVY-YBMqrogSEjYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=edendale+silverlake), Thirsty Crow, and [Cha Cha Lounge](https://www.google.com/search?q=bar+stella+silverlake&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yylaVY-YBMqrogSEjYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=cha+cha+lounge+silverlake) is hipster central, but a lot of fun. For clubs in Hollywood, it's not really my thing, so I can't recommend much, but any place owned by [Houston Hospitality](http://houstonhospitalityla.com) is a lot of fun, they have themed bars with hidden entrances: [Davey Wayne's](https://www.google.com/search?q=good+times+at+davey+waynes&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HCtaVdPhJNKyogSA1oHACA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAw&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768) is like a 1970's house party, and No Vacancy is just what is sounds like, one of the hardest velvet ropes to get past. If you are not a celebrity or a group of hot girls you need to be on the list. And sometimes they don't even let the girls in.\n\n* For hiking you may want to check in with /r/SoCalHiking, but right off the top of my head, the most LA hike you can do is Runyon, but it's a joke, walking up fire access roads with actors taking business calls on their bluetooth while they hold a pomeranian in each arm is not my favorite way to hike, but it's good for a laugh. Griffith has some good secluded trails contrary to popular opinion, I recommend the hike to [Bee Rock](https://www.google.com/search?q=old+LA+zoo&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aC5aVfaiB4vnoATggYGoBA&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=griffith+park+bee+rock+hike) for great views of the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys. And the [Old LA Zoo](https://www.google.com/search?q=old+LA+zoo&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aC5aVfaiB4vnoATggYGoBA&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1373&amp;bih=768) isn't really a hike, but it's a good place to take photos if you are in the area. There is a lot of hiking on the west side too, try Sullivan Canyon or Mandeville Canyon or Topanga State Park for views of the ocean, or go out to Malibu to Escondido Falls or Malibu Creek State Park, or go out on the 210 past Pasadena for Eaton Canyon or Mt Wilson or Mt Baldy if you are feeling adventurous, or go up into the mountains to places like the Angeles Crest or Big Bear is beautiful and cheaper in the summer off-season (totally worth it to get a cabin for a night and hang out in the fresh air of the pine forests). [Here](http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/blog/hiking-los-angeles-las-best-trails) is an article with details on some of those trails.\n\n* There are some secluded beaches up in Malibu, I recommend going to Point Dume and heading down the stairs, but it's a bit of a hike. But beaches with lots of other people can be a lot of fun, I recommend Manhattan Beach for a nice clean beach, with a ton of people playing volleyball.\n\n* For scenic places to take photos, those hikes and rooftop bars I recommended would be great. Also some obvious tourist spots with views, such as the Griffith Observatory and The Getty on the lawn (bring a picnic!).\n\n* I have rented jet skis in Long Beach before, but it's kind of nasty down there, a lot of gasoline and garbage floating in the water from the Port of Los Angeles. Not sure if you can do it in Santa Monica or not, I've never seen anyone doing it. But you can rent tandem bikes and rollerblades there and other stuff like that. A bike ride down the path to Venice Beach is touristy for sure, but still a lot of fun.\n\n* My favorite amusement park in LA is definitely Magic Mountain, which has the best rides and roller coasters. But Universal just opened a new [Simpsons-themed \"Springfield District\"](http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2015/05/17/Simpsons-themed-Springfield-section-opens-at-Universal-Studios-Hollywood/5221431873472/) if that interests you.\n\n* Have fun! Let me know if you want more or different recommendations. I didn't even get into restaurants yet, that could be a long list!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431973959", "subreddit": "AskLosAngeles", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

This week was pretty meh for me.\n\n**Genshiken 2 12/12**\n\nMore of the same, just good old Genshiken. The only real difference is the change in art style. Also, the show overall was a lot more serious than S1. Saki is still best girl, but to see [Ohno cosplaying as Yoko was pretty cool too](http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a10/daevakun/screenshots/kanako_yoko.jpg) (they aired at around the same time). Kucchi was still really annyoing though and all of his jokes were really unfunny. [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM1MvMgUEdE) was pretty good too.  **7/10** \n\n**Green Green 12/12**\n\nIt's *shit*, but not the worst thing I've ever seen, or even this week. I'd recommend watching it dubbed, because bad dubs make bad shows *so* much more enjoyable, especially if you want to hear a young Bryce Papenbrook. **4/10**\n\n**Gyo 1/1**\n\n**NOPE**. **NOPITY-NOPENOPE** From the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgMJbwR9MpY), I thought it'd the anime equivalent of Sharknado. And it was, but it was also really fucking gross. I almost threw up watching this. *Here's* the worst thing I've seen this week. *Bravo Ufotable* **2/10**\n\n**Hetalia Axis Powers 52/52**\n\nIt's cute little ONA series by DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN, and probably their best work. It's basically chibi world history. All the episodes are very short and very cute. I have no idea why the show insisted on shitting on Italy all the time. I'd recommend watching this dubbed just for the silly accents. **6/10**\n\n**Kara no Kyoukai 1 1/1**\n\nI have no idea what just happened but I think I like it? I'm not sure. The world seems interesting and I'd love to learn more about it in next moobies. Pounting [Shiki](http://i.imgur.com/53QshIz.png) is a miracle of the universe. **7/10**\n\n**Wanna Be The Strongest In The World! 12/12**\n\nWrestling anime, but it's animated by ARMS, so you know it'll be [visually pleasing](http://i.imgur.com/XEgaamS.png). This show was hard to watch, not because of the TnA (couldn't really give a shit about boobs in anime), but because of our main character, Sakura's screams and crying as she wrestles with other well endowed women. It's pretty grating on the ears, dub or sub. She does this for like 15 minutes an episode, for 12 episodes. It's very difficult to watch someone screaming in pain for 12 episodes. The *cinematography* is great. [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/Dr5OJ) some from episode 3.

It was one of two successors to the [Passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport_(automobile_dealership\\)) marque, which had a similar intent.\n\n&gt;Preceding the Asüna marque, Passport sold a Korean ([Daewoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_Daewoo)) made [badge engineered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badge_engineered) [Opel Kadett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_Kadett) E known as the [Passport Optima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport_Optima) (which hit Canadian shores in 1991) as well as a selection of [Isuzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu) cars and [SUVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUVs). [General Motors Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Canada) changed its branding strategy in 1988, disbanding Passport (the Optima was rebadged as [Pontiac LeMans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_LeMans)). Isuzu was grouped together with [Saab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_Automobile) and GM's new, import-fighting [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Corporation) division to form Saturn-Saab-Isuzu dealerships. The Geo marque was introduced in Canada in (model year) 1992, offered at [Chevrolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet)-[Oldsmobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile)-[Cadillac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac) dealers (who had been selling the Geo marque's products as Chevrolets from 1988 until the marque's introduction). Sales of Geo vehicles were relatively successful, prompting [Pontiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac)-[Buick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick)-[GMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC_(General_Motors_division\\)) dealers to request GM Canada to provide a lineup of similar \"import\" vehicles. Asüna was created to fulfill this demand.\n\n&gt;The Pontiac LeMans model name was dropped altogether in favour of trimline designations, selling as [Asüna SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As%C3%BCna_SE) in base trim hatchbacks and sedans, and as Asüna GT as a higher trim hatchback. The Asüna lineup was rounded out by the [Sunfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As%C3%BCna_Sunfire) and [Sunrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As%C3%BCna_Sunrunner) taking the [GMC Tracker's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Tracker) place in the Pontiac-Buick-GMC lineup.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/9mXRVYw.gif) [^(i)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Asuna_logo.gif)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Daewoo ^LeMans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daewoo_LeMans) ^| [^Isuzu ^Piazza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu_Piazza) ^| [^Chevrolet ^Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Tracker) ^| [^Passport ^\\(automobile ^dealership)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport_\\(automobile_dealership\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cro0ohu) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cro0ohu)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432843309", "subreddit": "Shitty_Car_Mods", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
