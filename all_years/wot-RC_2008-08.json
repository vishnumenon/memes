Appearantly the cat came from a not-so-nice background, so she already didn't like people too much, but she had a vicious Feral streak and pretty much loved to tear the shit out of anything that wasn't made of metal.\n\nAnyhow, once a month, at that time of month, she'd prowl around the house meowing and purring and rubbing up against people.  But as soon as you paid her the slightest amount of attention, petting or even looking at her, she'd hiss and take a swipe at you.\n\nThe kicker, for any of you WoT fans out there, they named her Nynaeve.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1217805143", "subreddit": "lolcats", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
