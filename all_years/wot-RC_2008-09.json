{"body": "It makes perfect sense if you are familiar with how the Irish speak; basically with a lot of \"aye's\" thrown in as signifying affirmation or agreement with what their interlocutor is saying.  In the parts of Northern Ireland where I've spent most of my time, it's very prevalent.  (After a week or two over there, I catch myself doing it as well, though I am from the US.)  I don't know that it's as common in the rest of Ireland, but neither have I spent all that much time there.  \n\nOne side of a conversation might go like this, for example: \"Aye... Aye...
