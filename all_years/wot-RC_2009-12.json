{"body": "Not got to this cos of fookin christmas, and I've been thinking about this question since you asked it.\n\n &gt; Does the observed person have some right to insist that the observer see and judge in a particular way? \n\nNo I don't believe that at all. It's completely up to anyone how they chose to see someone.\n\n &gt; Is this a problem or not?\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I can't answer such a question. If I found out all of a sudden that everyone thinks differently to how they treat me then I'd be pretty upset for a short while at least. It would be a horrible shock. The biggest change would be being paranoid about your typical thug kicking me in - of which there are a lot around where I live.\n\nIf this hypothetical situation always occured my mindset would be completely different. I wouldn't be as outgoing, or probably as happy - but I'd still absolutely \"get on with it\" as I do now and try not to think about it too much.\n\n &gt; I guess the question is -- to what extent does being trans rely on the perceptions of other people? \n\nIt matters more than anything else, for me anyway. But if it was impossible for people to percieve me as that then I guess it would be a much lower priority for me. I very rarely wish, hope and dream - I'd much rather be realistic about life.\n\n &gt; You have the right to demand equal treatment, but do you have the right to change what mental category others put you in?\n\nAs I say. Absolutely not.
