The barman comes over, regarding the trio with some curiosity, and says, \"What'll it be?\"\n\nThe man says, \"I'll have a pint,\" and turns to the ostrich, \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"I'll have a pint as well,\" says the ostrich. Bloke looks at the cat, and says, \"I suppose you want a drink too.\" The cat replies, \"I'll have a half, but I ain't fookin' payin'!\"\n\nSo the barman pulls two and a half pints, and says, \"That'll be three pounds forty, please.\" The man reaches into his pocket, feels around, and pulls out exactly three-forty in change. A while later, the same thing happens, and the man pulls the exact amount out of the same pocket.\n\nThe next day, the man, the ostrich, and the cat return to the same bar. \"I'll have a pint,\" says the man. \"Same for me,\" says the ostrich, and the cat orders up a half... \"But I ain't fookin' payin'!\" Repeat of yesterday.\n\nThe Bloke pays each time with the exact amount from his pocket. This becomes almost a regular routine until late one evening, the trio enters again.\n\n\"The same?\" asks the barman.\n\n\"Well\", says the man, \"it's close to last orders. I'll have a large scotch.\" He turns to the ostrich inquiringly. The bird says, \"I'll have a large scotch as well.\" The cat says, \"I'll have a small scotch... but I ain't fookin' payin'!\"\n\nThe barman rings up the drinks and turns, with a sly grin, \"that'll be seven pounds twenty, please.\" To his amazement, the man pulls the exact seven &amp; twenty out of his pocket. As the trio are finishing their drinks, the barman can't contain his curiosity any longer. \"Excuse me, sir, but before you leave there's something I must know... how do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket?\"\n\n\"Well,\" says the man, \"several years ago, I took care of an old lady well into her nineties, and when she died, she left me her old house. As I was cleaning out the attic, I found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a genie appeared and offered me two wishes.\"\n\n\"That's fantastic\", says the barkeep, \"What did you wish for?\"\n\n\"Well, if I ever need to pay for anything, I just put my hand in my pocket and the right money will always be there.\"\n\n\"That's brilliant,\" says the barman, \"most people would wish for a million pounds or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live.\"\n\n\"That's right, whether its a quart of milk or even a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there. The best thing I ever did!\"\n\nAs he turns to go, the barman calls him back and says, \"One last thing, sir... err, your friends there... we don't get many cats or ostriches drinkin' in 'ere...?\"\n\nThe man looks glum. \"Yes, I know. That's probably the worst thing I ever did, but I'm stuck with 'em.

It will have you screaming in frustration and wanting to claw your eyes out. \n\nPlease please please trust me.\n\nIf you want a truly epic book, take a look at Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.\n\nEDIT: To include reasons on why you steer clear of Wheel of Time\n\nThe story comes together quite nicely and then progressively unravels. Don't even try to keep track of all of the characters. For one thing you'll have one trouble keeping track of which character goes with which name when you have names like Elayne Egeanin, Elaida, and Egwene. Every single minor character has a name that is impossible to remember and when you finally decide that you can safely forget about them RJ decides to bring them back for a pivotal moment.\n\nYou can call it depth of story if you'd like, I call it excruciating detail. RJ falls in love with every character and is determined to show them throughout all of the books *Note: This only applies to the minor characters, interesting ones like Hurin the thief catcher or Elyas Machera get one chapter and are left to rot.\nSPOILER\n\nThis goes so far that once Rand actually accomplishes something at the end of book three, RJ decides that he liked those characters and *brings them back from the dead* thus negating the entirety of the accomplishments of the first three books.\n\nThe men vs. women vitriol is layed on thicker than the peanut butter on my wife's sandwhiches, and she loves Peanut butter. I swear if Nynaeve wants to tug her braid over stupid men one more time I'm going to yank it out and hit her in the face with it.\n\nIf you'd like the shortest, most eloquent summary of Book Ten without any spoilers look at this link: [Note the title and the title of the sequel](http://imgur.com/ooWEj.jpg)\n\nNever ever ever ending sub plots or descriptions.\n\nEDIT 2: Have any of you WoT lovers read Name of the Wind? Also, I can post more reasons.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1269486469", "subreddit": "books", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
