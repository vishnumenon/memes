{"body": "What subjects are we talking about? Obviously, you've learned how to speak english, so it's not as general as you state.\n\nRegarding science and math: For me, what makes the difference is knowing when to start and when to stop. I try to find something that's interesting enough to get me to want to read, and read and do just enough examples to get the big ideas. Then, I sit back and try to make something of the examples. Each major topic should be done in a day or so; work faster, and you end up stacking too much without allowing your brain to process. Working more slowly, you'll never get enough in your head to truly learn the material.\n\nFor literature and the humanities, I sit there with a spiral notebook and trace out the important ideas. I try to get the cheapest version of whatever it is I'm reading - photocopies of essays, cheap editions of books - and make annotations in the margins, then once I'm done, I try to condense the main ideas in the notebook. Family trees, characters' nicknames, plot points, main ideas and examples in essays, that sort of thing.\n\nBased on how you state your problem, though, you're facing something a bit more fundamental, so I have to reassert: find something you're interested in. There are books that I've studied where I drift constantly and couldn't tell you what they're about ten minutes or an hour in (fooking biology) and then, later on, I'll hit them at a point where I have *questions* about something, and it's easy as hell to plow through. Sometimes, though, you're never really going to be interested in reading dense books like that, and you have to remind yourself: good students read books cover to cover, great students are hard workers on *things that matter*. Your brain uses dopamine in response to actual new information; when it's at a density that's appropriate to you, you'll get the maximum dopamine response. Which means if you're trying to learn too slowly by, say, reading a shitty book cover to cover, you won't get much dopamine response. However, reading a very slim book on the same subject that treats the topic more as a curiosity and a *story* will cause much greater response, and you'll learn faster and more accurately.\n\nTry to gauge when you're no longer getting the \"high\" from studying. When that happens, you either need to a) change what you're doing or b) stop for a while. Most learning doesn't happen over books; it happens while doing dishes or going for a walk or sleeping, while you ask questions about what you were doing or your neurons chemically strengthen their connections without you being even aware.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1276468566", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From the start, let me say that I am not a terrorist, I don't want to overthrow the government, and I don't wear a tin foil hat.\n\nBut, I am PRIVACY CENTRIC.  \n\nAs a constant FF user, I would like more attention paid to privacy.\n\nIt's Google's obvious policy and behavior to record and save everyone's internet experience.  And, so I choose not to use Chrome.\n\nEveryday, government and business wants to collect data on its citizens.  It's simply none of their business.\n\nMay I suggest consciously opposing this trend and make Firefox the \"Privacy Browser\".\n\nI have installed and regularly use add-ons such as Regular Privacy, CSlite, Ghostery, NoScript, Request Policy, WOT, and other strategies (Anti-Spyware programs and other security and privacy programs) and behaviors (I don't click on every link on my email and every site I visit, and thank you WOT) that allow me to not be tracked and spied on.\n\nBut, I know that my privacy is still being violated.\n\nI think that \"Private Browsing\" is a good start.  I would like to see more of these kinds of features to be directly incorporated into FF.  \n\nOf course, a opt-in / opt-out option would be best to give users freedom to choose what is best for themselves.\n\nBut it is high time to allow users to not have to worry about POS (Parent on Shoulder or Piece of Shiat, depending on you point of view), of whatever form, to keep track of anyone, no matter what country we reside.\n\nWith China and Iran, among others (Australia), trying to censor the internet, and so many programs making it easier to keep track of user interests, I would like to see a browser to look out for the users rather than government and corporate interests.   \n\nI'll bet more individuals use FF than it is used in a business application.  And I would suspect that individuals are uncomfortable with anyone violating their privacy.\n\nThank you for setting up this opportunity to listen to your users.  It is rare in the business world and I applaud your efforts to meet the needs of your \"customers\".           \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1277154782", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
