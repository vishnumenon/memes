{"body": "UK Redditor here. I think the US accent will always be synonymous with being cool. I remember being a kid and whenever we were being 'cool' we'd put on an American accent. I quite like the San Franciscan twang (is that Steve Jobs' accent?), it lends itself really well to presentations or speaking in public. The inflexions in the voice are quite gentle and soft - giving the impression that the speaker is being genuine. \r\n\r\nMaybe my opinion has been shaped by listening to tonnes of techie podcasts over the years, most of which hail from the Silicon Valley area (just a guess). The New York (Noo Yawk) accent is brilliant to listen to for novelty factor but I don't know how well I'd react hearing bad news in that accent!\r\n\r\nIt's fascinating how perceptions are made from accents; in the UK the Birmingham accent is commonly perceived as dim witted, the Scouse (Liverpool) accent as funny, Glaswegian as aggressive, Posh London as pompous and \"lah di dah\", cockney London as untrustworthy and \"cheeky chappy oi oi\", Mancunian (Manchester) as down to earth and no nonsense.
