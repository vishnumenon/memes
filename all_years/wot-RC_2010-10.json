{"body": "The taxis are rather inexpensive (compared to most of the western world) and so staying out late is not an issue. (also cab fares are considerably cheaper at night). \n\n10 days might be a bit long, but if you plan your days well you should find enough to keep you occupied (Singapore can provide for some really fun times if you are with someone). \n\nClarke Quay is damn good; prices are pretty good, its well lit, music is relatively good, lots of clubs/bars to choose from. I also recommend the shisha from Merkesh or for non-alcoholic adventures Arab street is quite nice for Shisha. (remember to wear jeans/trousers/relatively nice shoes if you do choose to visit clark q).\n\nIf you want a damn tastey burger, plus some of the finest beer in asia I recommend visiting Brewerkz (a micro brewery) on Clark Q. There is also another micro brewery which is good for lunch/dinner in the centre of town called the 'little red dot'. \n\nFor food: CHECK OUT THE LOCAL HAWKERS, the chicken rice is a must and everything else is pretty pretty good. Also if you are there for a few days a trip to 'little india' and 'china town' is a must, the food + shopping are pretty damn good. \n\nDon't bring much chewing gum with you, although if you have a packet you should be fine (you can chew it in public etc.) .\n\nThe Zoo, Botanic Gardens, Jurong Bird Park are defiantly worth a visit too, go early in the morning to get the most out of the zoo. Also the night Safari is worth hitting up.\n\nSentosa has enough attractions to keep you occupied for a day or two, the beaches aren't up to much but 'Cafe del mar' is a nice place to chill out after a day of exploring. \n\nWestern style (but pretty much anything goes) should be fine, Most people wear jeans/trousers a lot regardless of the heat (as most of the country is air conditioned). But you probably will want to wear shorts/t-shirts for visits to the zoo etc (the middle of the day is fooking hot).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286298586", "subreddit": "singapore", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
