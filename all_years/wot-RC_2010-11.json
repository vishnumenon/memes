And also, to continue:\n\nNope, the people around him figured out that by making *John* look like the one who had completely flipped his lid, well, of course, *they'd* look like a bunch of saints &amp; they'd be **total heroes** for rescuing him from certain psychosis, which they (of course) accomplished by putting him in the nuthouse with a bunch of retarded perverts wearing footy pajamas whose most impressive talents were drooling into sippy cups without spilling and possibly making a cool t-shirt in fucking Occupational Therapy one time.\n\nSo one of our country's best mathematicians got put into a situation where he was completely degraded, demeaned, belittled, analyzed, scolded, and plenty more, which is to say nothing at all about how he was basically *destroyed* psychologically by this.\n\nThen, the doctors &amp; the people that he had trusted, the people that he thought he could *rely* on, decided to make sure that he *\"got the help that he needed\"*, which undoubtedly is best accomplised by slapping these meaningless pseudo-scientific terms on him, knowing full well that once you get called \"DELUSIONAL\", \"PARANOID\", and \"SCHIZOPHRENIC\", which is just fucking lovely, of course, well, that sort of \"diagnosis\" by a \"panel of experts\" has a tendency to stick, long after the patient feels better or kills themself out of pure self-loathing. Or whatever.\n\nAnd then, of course, this is to totally deny the man *any* chance at redemption or even giving him the tiniest hope of feeling somewhat vindicated by the circumstances of the era, well of course, later on when the OTHER mathematicians needed to figure out some *very* difficult problems, they were all like:\n\n\"Hurr durr! I sure wish John Nash hadn't gone *crazy*, man, because I bet he'd be able to solve this problem of ours in, like, **no time at all**.\" - says the Mediocre Mathematician who knows he will probably never write a single publication that will *ever* have the kind of impact that game theory has had on the world.\n\n\"DERP DERP, you sure said it! If only we could have done SOMETHING DIFFERENT DERP DERP DERP to help John out when he needed us instead of just dropping his sorry ass off at the mental institution for the rest of his life! But we didn't, we all just stood around with our thumbs up our butts, like most math guys are wont to do. AMIRITE?\" - says the other math d00d, who is actually probably really smart but doesn't want to admit that he was wrong about **anything**. \n\n**EVER.**\n\nSo, then all those mathematicians would get a little lump in the back of their throats and they would think about how the Nobel Committee totalled dissed Nash too, and they'd be all like, well fuck. every. thing. about. this. But they'd never say it out loud, becase that would be an admission, of sorts; an admission that somewhere, somehow, someway, there had been an Epic Fucking Systemic Failure of some kind, and whether it was because Nash actually truly *did* go completely crazy, or possibly just *ran out of friends, money, paying gigs, and the other bare necessities of life*, and as a result of this, became sick, from lack of nutrition; from lack of friendship, lack of people he could confide in, lack of *everything*, basically.\n\nAnd, I don't really know, fellow Redditors, maybe I'm just talking out my ass here, and I'll be the first one to admit that when somebody needs a psychiatric evaluation or truly needs to find the right kinds of medications to stabilize them and help them get better over time, they should *go to the doctor and get help* before it's too late.\n\nBut all this fucking cross-threaded backstabbing flamebaiting monster trolling creeping/stalking/skulking/lurking thread-crapping bullshit I'm seeing every single day on the various sub-reddits I once cherished, is pretty fookin' boring if you ask me. Sure, sometimes it's funny, and certainly some people are too thin-skinned, but the truth is, some other mother puppies are total *reactionary morons* when it comes right down to it, and for once I just wish people would drop the goddamned facade for like *five minutes* before turning into Internet Tough Guys that would rather give a blowjob to Chortles Neckbeard Snorlax than say something positive to someone less fortunate than themselves once in a while.\n\nAnd brokenseattle, SomeBug, and Maxxover, this comment is *not* directed at you, although I do hope you get the chance to read it. I just thought this was a fairly decently trafficked spot with a couple fairly rational redditors having a pretty decent conversation. So, uh, I guess I'll see you guys around, hunh.\n\n(also, there are other people that will see this post that probably won't like what I had to say, but hey.
