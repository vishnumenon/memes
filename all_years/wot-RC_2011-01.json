By default this makes atheism, as it relates to the sciences, synonymously interchangeable with the scientific method -- atheists don't believe there is no god, they haven't been provided sufficient evidence for the hypothesis.\n\nIOW, what I'm saying is that ultimately you cannot have a science classroom which does not \"push\" atheism, because atheism is nothing more than a scientific (reasonable) approach to the subject of religion. The point that the professor was making is entirely secular and appropriate -- and it is accurate -- though obviously not tactful enough to deal with the childish emotional outburst that would be the reaction of most people. Pandering to the immaturity and egotism of religious ideologues is not the job of a physics professor. You think you're asking for equality, but you're actually asking for special treatment. \n\nYour comment is typical of the kind of argument for the middle-ground fallacy that plagues most people who esteem themselves to be intelligence or above-average in their talent for objectivity...

{"body": "Back when I was going to U of Cincy (part of the story will date me) I was living in the non-traditional floor since I was a transfer student.  Good times.  \n\nDuring orientation our RA handed out condoms in perfect [dimebag ziplocks](http://www.blogginghigh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dimebag.jpg).  I really don't care which went faster, the condoms or the baggies, but after about two weeks the floor was bare.\n\nI was chosen to go talk to the RA.  Damn she was cute.  So I tell her the floor wants more free condoms.  She's hungover as hell, mumbles something, and hands me a piece of paper she had just written on.  Apparently I was to go to the health centre with said note for the condoms.  Ok.\n\nAfter a very short but brisk (it was fookin' cold) walk I arrive and awkwardly find someone to talk to.  I'm sure my face was red for more than one reason as I handed over the note.  I'm really not sure what I was expecting; I hadn't thought this through.  The nurse takes the note, smiles a bit, and wanders off into the back.\n\nI can only assume what was running through her mind as the most efficient way to get this job done but her eyes saw a [copy paper box](http://www.boxcycle.com/images/products/paper_ream_box_letter.jpg) and that's what she went with.  After dumping all the condoms that were in the dimebags she scanned the room and disappeared to the left, out of my sight.  From there all I could hear were drawers and doors opening and closing at an alarming rate.  It was at this point I decided to look behind me.  The entire place was staring at me...\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity the nurse came back out and proudly handed me a half full copy box, about 20% with the baggies, the rest just...  just there.  I quickly exited the room wondering how the fuck I was going to do this.  In my brilliance I decided to check my mail hoping there was enough junk in there to cover up the condoms so I could make my 10 story elevator ride in relative peace.  There was!\n\nAs luck (?) would have it, one of my roommates was already on the elevator waiting for me (I didn't ask) but just as the door was about to close, the hottest blonde I had ever seen gets on the elevator.  Ok, no problem.  Shy dude, roommate to back me up, she has no idea what's in this box.  I can do this.\n\nOoooh!  Is that the new Rolling Stone with Nirvana on the cover?!?  \n\nLe grab.\n\nLe condoms.\n\nLe awkward silence.\n\nRoommate busts out laughing and yells \"shit, man!  Who you inviting to this party?!?\"\n\nTL;DR  Giant box of condoms got me laid.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296285871", "subreddit": "fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm English but usually write \"British\". I suppose it's the vocal ones (anti-English, pro-'proper' British types) who we hear complaining about this and that: \"I'm WELSH!\" or \"I'm SCOTTISH! not fookin' British!\" (though of course it's better to be native Brit than an evil invading Angle, of course).\n\nI realise that the English have been complete f$!kers over the years (\"Sorry about the colonisations, our bad!\") but I have to admit that I'm not very happy with the way Scottish/Welsh MPs can vote on 'English' matters but the system doesn't work in reverse due to devolution. Maybe I'm being naive, but a case in point is the student fees: No Scottish or Welsh students will be paying the fees that English students will have to. What's your take on that sort of thing?\n\nI've always wondered why there's no Welsh element in the flag. It ain't right, imo.\n\nWith regards the national anthem: OH DEAR CHRIST GET RID OF THAT FUCKING AWFUL DIRGE OF A FUNERAL MARCH!\n\nJeeeeeeesus! It's dull, it's slow, it plods, it's boring, it's dead.

How many British/English actually believe in any god, let alone *that* one? And seeing as the other verses (*aren't **they** a fucking joy?!*) are usually forgotten, WHAT exactly does the anthem say about our nation? FUCK ALL. Monarch, monarch, monarch. Yay for the monarch. Now what about the people and the land?\n\nAt least you guys get *The Land of my Fathers*, *Flower of Scotland* ( and *Soldier's Song*) when you're doing your own thing. We English are stuck with that fucking dirge.\n\nSorry. Rant over. I had to vent. I think I might go and campaign at the National Secular Society to get it changed to something a bit more tasteful like *Land of hope and glory* (let's ignore certain aspects of that one...!)\n\nedit - more rant!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296516197", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
