{"body": "Well, yes I'm in happy slappy BC, *but* have you read the section on health care in their official platform? \n\n&gt;Greens understand that health is about more than “health care.” We are in the midst of a cancer epidemic, and no one is willing to speak of it out loud. Hundreds of chemicals used in our everyday life carry risks of increased cancer, infertility, learning disabilities and other intellectual impairment, and damage to the immune system. There are less-toxic substitutes for these products, but industry lobbies to maintain their registration and legal use drown out the voices of concerned health professionals and families concerned about health.

What we do have is [an aging population](http://www.cancer.ca/canada-wide/about%20cancer/cancer%20statistics/~/media/CCS/Canada%20wide/Files%20List/English%20files%20heading/pdf%20not%20in%20publications%20section/Canadian20Cancer20Statistics2020102020English.ashx) (as well as improving diagnostic capabilities). Standardized for age, [there is no significant increase in rate of cancer over time](http://imgur.com/tQ46j).\n\nThen of course there are these little gems: \n\n&gt;Provide funds to expand provincial health insurance to cover proven alternative therapies that are less expensive and invasive such as chiropractic, massage, acupuncture. (p. 68)\n\n&gt;We will promote complimentary health care – through support of chiropractic, naturopathic, homeopathic, and other non-western practices. The Green Party of Canada recognizes the value of good health as a fundamental human right, and also the key to the most vibrant, inclusive and sustainable Canadian society possible.

{"body": "The majority of artists make their money from merch and live shows. Not albums. So when I torrent, who do I hurt? Record companies.  But we'll get to that in a minute.\n\nThe truth is, the artist receives next to nothing from music not directly sold by them, from music sold via iTunes or your local CD distributor. Hence torrenting has minimal effect on them as performers.  It does, however, hurt record companies because they make a large amount of money off of CD sales to distributors. But note, record companies typically support a huge number of bands.  They're making less, but it's certainly not hurting.\n\nThe reality of this situation is entirely different than your perspective of it. Your metaphor, quite frankly, is wrong.  Bands who release their music for free tend to have far greater merch sales, because more people have access to it with less effort. (true story, seen it happen many times.)\n\nWith the availability of free music so widespread, (Want music? Mediafire, Youtube, Frostwire, Torrent sites, the list goes on.) the record companies need to find a new method of making money.  Modern society is not friendly to easily copied materials, but artists are certainly not struggling due to this.  Every band that I have ever played with has offered electronic copies of their music for free online, and provided physical copies for purchase at shows alongside merch.\n\n**TL;DR, Artists make the majority of their money from merch at live shows, and torrenting has little to no effect on them.**\n\nEDIT: fookin' autocorrect.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304177152", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
