If you want to become good at drafting I suggest you find some articles on it.\n\nNow there are tons of decks that are relatively cheap, and can win you loads of games. My personal favorite of these are the Valakut/Scapeshift, Tezzerator and Jacerator decks. These are decks that attack through other angles, so most casual players won't be expecting them. I don't think either of them are Standard legal anymore, and probably not even extended legal (FUCK YOU WOTC FOR FUCKING UP EXTENDED), but I am sure there are similar standard legal decks available today. \n\nAlso if your brother in law don't care about standard/extended legal, I am sure a tezzerator deck would kill his shit good 90% of the time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305191313", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
