D, why? \"Sure, my right foot got hot.\"\n* Once did a jig on top of a moving bus, nearly falling/dying in the process\n* Climbing in the mountains with my father and some others, the groundsheet wouldnt stop sliding. D pulls out an ice screw, taps it into place. Problem solved, until a few moments later when another friend said \"Guys, I can't move my trousers.\" D had put the screw through the sheet without checking what was below.\n* A story of bad luck: needing a shit, he was supposed to go to this secluded rock, but he could see a large group of people steadily approaching. The others convinced him to have a shit, because to them he would just be some random guy up in the mountains. They pass by with calls of \"Hey, D!\". Turns out, they were from his climbing group back home.\n* Another shit story, needing a place to lay one. One guy finds the perfect spot, a gap between two rocks, and marks it with a plastic bag because it was hidden from view. D goes, comes back some time later \"Jeysus guys, I nearly fookin doid up there!\" He had seen the bag, but not the perfect spot, and had climbed up to the top of a rock nearby. Imagine hanging your arse over a 13 foot drop, and shitting into it. Unbelievable.\n* He worked on a construction site, and people would often ask him the time. Rather than look at his watch and tell them, he opted to wear it upside down like [this](http://i.imgur.com/NzSQf.png). \"But D, how will you be able to tell the time?\" Simple: contort your arm around like you are trying to put your hand on the same shoulder as the hand it is (left hand on left shoulder, for example)\n\nThere are a few more stories, I can't think of them now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1307013834", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
