{"body": "People who are claiming to be fans of both separate franchises and then proceed to complain about lack of plot in this one blow my fooking mind.  Let's do a brief rundown of the plot in previous films.  \n\nAlien - People find strange spaceship with alien eggs.  Alien hatches, proceeds to kill everyone except one woman who narrowly escapes.  \n\nAliens - Same woman. More aliens.  And marines.  And Paul Reiser. wtf.\n\nAlien 3 - Same woman. Shaves her head. Prisoners instead of marines. Oh and now she's pregnant.\n\nAlien: Resurrection - Same woman. No, wait, she's a clone. And she has alien powers.  But gets points for Brad Dourif as an obsessive scientist and Ron Perlman. Because, Ron fucking Perlman.\n\nPredator - Guys in jungle fight occasionally invisible alien.  One guy escapes.  \n\nPredator 2 - Another occasionally invisible alien.  In the city for some reason.  Danny Glover proves he's not too old for this shit. Oh look. Bill Paxton.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I like all of these movies, but they're not exactly thick on the plot. AvP:R wasn't exactly Shakespeare but it was better than AvP and it was as brutal as any of the other movies were.  The whole point of the alien in the nursery is to make you freakishly uncomfortable, which is the general idea behind horror movies.  \n\nThis matchup would have never been as good as anyone hoped, for the same reason that movies made from books are never good enough.  Everyone walks in with astronomical expectations, the movie fails to meet them, then it sucked and it's a travesty.  \n\nPrime example, the last Indiana Jones movie. It went just as over-the-top as any previous Indy films, but everyone had waited so long for it and expected so much, it could never have been good enough.  \n\ntl:dr  movies suck if you expect them to.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310172356", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The man's a fookin egit! Literally he gave you no other reason other than his feelings for you are gone? Fuck being in love with someone, it always feels horrendous and unsettling and surely you can only know if someone is truly perfect for you once those feelings have died down and you aren't in love anymore. Surely it is only then that you can judge a person objectively? Everyone's perfect when you're in love with them, even the ones that treat you like shit. If this is his only reason then he's an IDIOT. \n\nEveryone wants to find someone who they just feel more and more in love with every day for the rest of their lives because that's what hollywood shoves down your throat from birth. I don't, being in love feels remarkably similar to being sick. At least make him give you a real facking reason.\n\nWhen will people learn that being in love with someone is merely a short lived biological process. Actually loving someone on the other hand is a choice, it is an action, to constantly improve one another and one another's lives. \n\ntl;dr read the road less travelled by Scott.M.Peck it explains it better than I can. Tbh though most people want to hold on to that delusional fairytale fantasy of being in love with someone no matter the cost to themselves.

{"body": "examples: almost every hero has some form of CC.\n\nsupport heroes: made to rely on little to 0 farm (literally have boots then spend rest of money on wards) btu can still do ok damage. (witch slayer's ult is somewhere around 750 magic damage).\n\nLess health/more damage: building tanky in hon is harder. everyone does alot more damage, and everyone starts ith alot less health (and its harder to get built up more.\n\nlarger map: the jungles have more creeps, of varying difficulties. the dragon equivalent each team has on their side of the map. you can actaully stack creeps (as its called) so a jungle camp will have 3 spawns of minions to kill! (epic xp and gold). this makes warding more important though. there are alot of places to sneak in behind people.\n\nNo neutral buffs:instead every 2 min a rune appears in 1 of two places in the river. rune control is essential as they give pretty epic things (double damage, invisibility, total regeneration, illusion (2 copies of self, weakened but good for tricking and scouting enemies)\n\ndenies: at first they will make you mad. but as farm is more important in teh game you can keep minion waves in one spot in the lane if you deny and last hit properly. this means with wards you can safely farm for a very long time.\n\ndont push minions to tower: in lol, this is good, as you can push early with it. in hon, not only will the tower take little to no damage, because the enemies can deny while those  minions are on their tower, you will lose alot of xp and gold. \n\nbaron = kongor: it is even possible to kill kongor at level 1 (with very specific picks) for a massive xp boost. but kongor doesnt give the team a buff, instead it gives a token (takes up item slot) that when that heroe dies, they rez after (1 second i think?) at full HP and mana.\n\ngold loss on death: this is rough. especially when you are new. play casual mode games (as you wotn lose the gold on death) to get warmed up to the game. later on though, its a beautiful thing. if their carry is getting farmed. gank him a few times. he just lost over 1k gold. much better to turn a game around than (they cant farm for about a min).\n\nteh roles of heroes (support, carry, tank, initiator, etc) are much more defined. in LoL a support hero can get stupid farmed and carry (saw a sona do it). in hon, if a support hero is getting farmed, that means they should be buying more wards/counter wards etc for ganks as they will not scale like a carry will.\n\nStats vs AD/AP: you have 3 stats in hon. STR gives you hp and hp regen. AGI gives you attack speed and armor. INT gives you mana and mana regen. all heroes have a primary stat, which for each point gives them addition attack damage.\n\nany more questions just ask. i quite enjoy both LoL and HoN and feel the feud between the two is ridiculous. different games with same goal (like football and soccer. get the ball over there to win). but both have their good and bad qualities.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311961886", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
