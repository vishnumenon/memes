He wasn't your typical racist, sweary gobshite either. \n\n\"Hey guys, is everyone at the airport?\" Is the first thing he said, or something along the lines of that. Suddenly, this scouser (guy from Liverpool) jumped down his throat. He was saying stuff like, \"**Ey, you little fookin' piece a' shit yank, why don't ya go lose another fookin' war, eh? Ya fookin' make me sick lad, ya squeaky American cunt. Eh, lads, team up on the yank, yeah?**\". He was on at this kid for about 10 minutes straight, and the kid sounded like he was on the verge of tears, and no-one was standing up to the scouser.\n\nI called the kid on his in-game phone, which takes you to a private chat, and said something like: \"You alright, mate? How about you get in my car, and we go hunt down this fucking bully. Kill the bastard a few-hundred times?\". He obviously agreed, and we spent the next half-hour griefing him. He was shouting insults at me, telling me I was a cunt and that I was betraying our country (bit extreme, eh?), but me &amp; this kid were going medieval on his ass. He eventually got vote-kicked, and all the other players *thanked us*, then we all had a great game.\n\n**EDIT:** Well, actually, the scouser started off with just some light teasing.
