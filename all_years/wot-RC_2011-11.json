I actually commented on every video and tried to keep it objective.\n\nI was in anime club library meet-ups in the early 90s with other anime fans because it was bigger (and smelled better) than someone's bedroom, had the av equipment, and we could sit around and talk about it afterwards.  The newer and/or  the less culturally knowledgable could ask questions and it was a lot of fun.  It was eye opening experience for someone who only previously been exposed to (but LOVED) Battle of the Planets, Robotech, Starblazers, Tranzor Z, Starblazers, Speed Racer, etc.  I'd always HATED 7 Zark 7 and didn't realize why until I got to see the original.\n\nI rented every anime series I could get from mom &amp; pop shops in the mid 90s.  Now that I think about it, How the hell did I get out of college given how much time I spent watching anime and playing video games? Bygones.\n\nThat said, I've watched the changes and LOVE the current fansubs.  I thought completely, but have to agree with OtaKing about the lack of grammatical corrections.  I think this displays a level of verbal awardness in the difference in the languages themselves and does not contribute to immersion in the culture or story presented.\n\nAs for the rest, He makes solid points for what he does and doesn't like, but falls into crying about things not being done the way they \"should be\" too much.  And I don't agree with what he thinks should be.  It's NOT a documentary, it's an opinion piece.\n\nIt's FOOKING AMAZING that there are so many options now.

{"body": "There have only been two episodes from this season so far so take this speculation with the grain of salt it deserves.\n\nEvery character has a new power (or is new to the show).  This means each character now has more aspects to who they are, giving more to explore.  \n\nMisfits has six episodes per season/series; there are six main characters.\n\nEpisode one focused on Rudy.  Granted, this was partly to introduce him to the show, but it also contained a fair amount of exploration and development of his character, and how he was able to evolve by learning to cope with his powers.\n\nEpisode two focused on Curtis.  This explored a lot of his weakness in character and his shortcomings.  It also explored the difficulties that can arise with his power (both the physical/societal differences as well as the psychological side).  From this, Curtis learned to better understand his power, grow as a person in a substantial (and positive) way, and flesh/feel out a lot of the conflict that has been festering inside him.\n\nEach episode had other plots within as well, but there was a dominant plot in each centered around a single character.  They may well continue this approach through the rest of the season, which allows them to continue overarching stories, as well as develop each character in a very personal basis.\n\nTake Kelly, for instance.  She has a \"useless\" power (\"Imma fookin' rocket scientist!), which is shown in the second episode to have some merits to it (when she fixes the car for Powertrader Man).  The creative powers behind Misfits aren't ones to do useless things - they might use it to show that people are sometimes helpless, but they don't dangle it there, untouched and unabused.  I suspect there will be a Kelly-centric episode which focuses on her and her relationship to her new power, whether it is understanding how to apply it in a more useful way, or change powers, or struggle against its lack of usefulness in the gang's situations.\n\nThat leaves three episodes, three characters.  I only saw a snippet from next week's preview, but it seemed to suggest Simon as a prominent plot.  That might be his episode, then the Kelly episode, then two more: an Alisha episode, and an episode for a grand finale where it all comes together.  \n\n**tl;dr five episodes centered around each character, then a finale.  This was Curtis' turn**\n\nRegarding your actual question and opinion however, I did enjoy the episode.  I didn't care much for Curtis up until that point, but this really developed his character in a way I found most interesting.  I like the other characters a lot, though, and would have liked to see more of them.

Thing is, we prided ourselves on being a \"melting pot\" where all the people of the world come here to be free and then boned a whole lot. The other side of this is that America has very little history, save our native side which we largely ignore (genocide you say!? we would never!!!!) so considering that our \"history\" is only 250 years old, we don't have much to go on and be proud about so we use our European history instead. I'm 2nd Generation American on me dads side, and who knows on me mums as she is part Cherokee native and European. Back when me grandfather was born (1/4 native Cherokee), if you could write your newborn baby off as Caucasian, you did (As she did thus making it harder to trace our history). This provided a potentially better life for your kid, because as you have no doubt seen, we are a VERY discriminatory country, which is the funny bit tbh. We \"pride\" ourselves on being a \"melting pot\" but in reality, we do everything that we can to keep ourselves separate from others. In some areas, we are no better than the caste system of India.\n\nAlso its fun to know your personal history, where you came from and why, I'm not huge into the genealogy thing, but being a recent descendant of the Habsburg family of Europe, its not exactly that hard. In fact its hard to avoid. \n\nAlso fun fact, the \"African Americans\" here in America are, on average, more American than most Caucasian folks, due to them being here since the inception of the country and/or long before due to the slave trade (most can't trace their history past the Civil War) and its still considerably longer than most whites in America.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321227016", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

She's supposed to be the most organic character out of the bunch. I really hate it when the writers so desperately try to slip in those 'I'm a fookin rocket scianteest' lines into the script. They don't really add anything to the story. Same goes for the \"Fookin' Nazees\" line in the latest episode. It's one of the least substantive lines in the episode but for some reason, it gets special emphasis because of the way she says it. And some people here will look at that and think, 'It's genius cause it's Kelly!' - when the truth is that the writers have merely resorted to milking the Kelly character who was so prevalent in the first two series. It seems like genius because it works off who Kelly used to be. The problem is she's not that person anymore.
