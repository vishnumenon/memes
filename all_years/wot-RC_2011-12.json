I wouldnt recommend running to the bride and making a big deal over it, but if wedding talk comes up naturally it would be ok to mention you were a little taken back that she tried avoiding the subject. Let her know that you're hurt that she didnt say anything not that you werent picked. I'm currently planning my wedding and I can tell you its stressful! I was killing myself to make everyone else happy and I was miserable, just cause I didnt want to let anyone down.\n\nIn all honesty weddings are expensive and she may not have had the money to have a large bridal party. I can tell you thatt my Fiance's 3 brothers are not \"in\" the wedding because we didnt have the money or room in the bridal party. Instead we asked them to be part of our day in other ways... The oldest (long story there) is going to be one of our readers, the middle brother is a graphic designer and he designed all our stationary (i.e. invitations, thankyous, etc.), and his youngest brother is a gifted musician who will be performing for our ceremony. \n\nYour friend may not realize that you are hurt, and I'm sure she isnt trying to hurt you. Give her a break, she may still come thru with a position for you... .and not being a bridesmaid means you wotn have to shell out $150 + for a dress that you may never wear again, you have more time to enjoy yourself at the wedding (no being told where you have to be and when for things like pictures), and if she starts acting like a Bridezilla you dont have to be caught in her crosshairs...
