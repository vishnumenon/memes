{"body": "FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU had story almost finished then page somehow reloaded. Shit, anyway.. here it goes again.. +1 me for persistence and patience ;)\n\nSetting the scene: Ypres, Belgium; 11th November 2011.\n\nPersonnel:\n\n- ~20 ATC Cadets (Air Training Corps)\n\n- ~20 ACF Cadets (Army Cadet Force)\n\n- ~25 Overseas ATC Cadets (assholes)\n\nLaws:\n\n- Drinking age in belgium - 16\n\n- Our ages (16-18)\n\nWe started the day by going to Ypres Parade to commemorate the fallen heroes of WW1. Then, we were allowed to freeroam, had lunch etc. then in the evening we were set free on the sleepy town of Ypres again, it being a Friday night - we had to celebrate... specially since for the first time in a long time it was actually legal here!\n\nSo a group of the \"cool guys\" (people that were actually friends at least), go out.. there's about 8 of us: The Sgt Major, Hench Black guy (HBG), Tall Black Guy (TBG), Kenny (those were the names we gave them anyway).. and some other wasters I can't remember.. so periodically, almost everyone gets FUBAR'ed (Apart from me and the SM - being the responsible SNCO's we are).. Time to get back to the minibuses, we get out of the pub, and Hench Black Guy automatically goes batshit insane, starts running up and down the square doing backflips, Tall Black Guy is throwing up in an alley way, and Kenny ran off somewhere, not to be seen until later. (Great!)\n\nWe get to the minibuses, trying our best to conceal the drunks, amongst the other cadets who didn't join us drinking, and go back to the barracks. It begins.\n\nNow first of all, the ATC room is fucked in its own right.. I pushed a drunk guy off a bed (ironically so he doesn't fall of).. and he's crying on the floor, moaning about his leg (I got a video of that somewhere)..\n\nThinking \"fuck this\" I go to the ACF room... to find chaos amongst men. The room is FUBAR - shit (not literal) all over the floor, mattresses being thrown.. fucking everything.. Hench Black Guy is running around the fucking room naked, my mistake was opening the door to which everyone screamed \"noooo!!\".. because he barged past me and ran the fuck out into the corridor; Tall Black Guy is on his bed trying his best to fuck Kenny in the arse (reminded me of a dog trying to hump another, and the humpee helplessly using all of its might to get out), while several more are passed out on their bed, whilst the rest of the contingent watch in horror, shock, amazement and hysterical laughter.\n\nGoing back to the ATC room, I find the guy I pushed off the bed is now sad because I'm not in the room and can't go to sleep without me being there (aww), and starts turning violent and throwing shit around the room (the motherfucker threw a suitcase at me).. after some scuffing (and him sticking a bucket over a fat kids head), we finally calm him down and put him to sleep (unlike your unloved pets.. he only went to sleep for the night).\n\nSo after all those drunken shenanigans, one of the staff members from the overseas squadron peeks over the bannister (staff were upstairs) and in his geordie accent shouts \"are ya havin' a fookin' giraffe?!\", to which I bite my tongue preventing me bursting into uncontrollable laughter until he's gone..\n\nGo back to my room, find a cadet named 'Luigi' jumping on the bed pretending he's playing Mario &amp; Luigi..  After enough of the amusement, I go to the ACF room.. to find one of their SNCO's in his PJ's (vest &amp; leggings), wearing his peaked cap for his No1 dress and his regimental belt around his waist, lap dancing on Tall Black Guy.. After this &amp;#3232;\\_&amp;#3232; moment, I thought I had enough, and decided to go to sleep... what I find...

{"body": "FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU had story almost finished then page somehow reloaded. Shit, anyway.. here it goes again.. +1 me for persistence and patience ;)\n\nSetting the scene: Ypres, Belgium; 11th November 2011.\n\nPersonnel:\n\n- ~20 ATC Cadets (Air Training Corps)\n\n- ~20 ACF Cadets (Army Cadet Force)\n\n- ~25 Overseas ATC Cadets (assholes)\n\nLaws:\n\n- Drinking age in belgium - 16\n\n- Our ages (16-18)\n\nWe started the day by going to Ypres Parade to commemorate the fallen heroes of WW1. Then, we were allowed to freeroam, had lunch etc. then in the evening we were set free on the sleepy town of Ypres again, it being a Friday night - we had to celebrate... specially since for the first time in a long time it was actually legal here!\n\nSo a group of the \"cool guys\" (people that were actually friends at least), go out.. there's about 8 of us: The Sgt Major, Hench Black guy (HBG), Tall Black Guy (TBG), Kenny (those were the names we gave them anyway).. and some other wasters I can't remember.. so periodically, almost everyone gets FUBAR'ed (Apart from me and the SM - being the responsible SNCO's we are).. Time to get back to the minibuses, we get out of the pub, and Hench Black Guy automatically goes batshit insane, starts running up and down the square doing backflips, Tall Black Guy is throwing up in an alley way, and Kenny ran off somewhere, not to be seen until later. (Great!)\n\nWe get to the minibuses, trying our best to conceal the drunks, amongst the other cadets who didn't join us drinking, and go back to the barracks. It begins.\n\nNow first of all, the ATC room is fucked in its own right.. I pushed a drunk guy off a bed (ironically so he doesn't fall of).. and he's crying on the floor, moaning about his leg (I got a video of that somewhere)..\n\nThinking \"fuck this\" I go to the ACF room... to find chaos amongst men. The room is FUBAR - shit (not literal) all over the floor, mattresses being thrown.. fucking everything.. Hench Black Guy is running around the fucking room naked, my mistake was opening the door to which everyone screamed \"noooo!!\".. because he barged past me and ran the fuck out into the corridor; Tall Black Guy is on his bed trying his best to fuck Kenny in the arse (reminded me of a dog trying to hump another, and the humpee helplessly using all of its might to get out), while several more are passed out on their bed, whilst the rest of the contingent watch in horror, shock, amazement and hysterical laughter.\n\nGoing back to the ATC room, I find the guy I pushed off the bed is now sad because I'm not in the room and can't go to sleep without me being there (aww), and starts turning violent and throwing shit around the room (the motherfucker threw a suitcase at me).. after some scuffing (and him sticking a bucket over a fat kids head), we finally calm him down and put him to sleep (unlike your unloved pets.. he only went to sleep for the night).\n\nSo after all those drunken shenanigans, one of the staff members from the overseas squadron peeks over the bannister (staff were upstairs) and in his geordie accent shouts \"are ya havin' a fookin' giraffe?!\", to which I bite my tongue preventing me bursting into uncontrollable laughter until he's gone..\n\nGo back to my room, find a cadet named 'Luigi' jumping on the bed pretending he's playing Mario &amp; Luigi..  After enough of the amusement, I go to the ACF room.. to find one of their SNCO's in his PJ's (vest &amp; leggings), wearing his peaked cap for his No1 dress and his regimental belt around his waist, lap dancing on Tall Black Guy.. After this &amp;#3232;\\_&amp;#3232; moment, I thought I had enough, and decided to go to sleep... what I find... The violent drunk guy (one of my good friends), has pulled his and my bunk together, to make a double bunk bed... \n\nFuck Drunk people\n\n**TL;DR FOBAR'd Army Cadets almost literally fucking each other in the ass while Massive Black Guy runs around stark naked all after a night out drinking on 11.11.11 in Belgium.**\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1326414388", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
