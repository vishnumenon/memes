{"body": "I finally get to tell this story!\n\nI had a wiener dog who for the purposed of anonymity we shall refer to as Rufus Rampage, or RR for short.  Now I will preface this by saying that I loved the shit out of this dog, anyone who spent time with him felt basically the same way, because he was smart and for the most part affectionate, but let me tell you right now he was a sneaky little bastard.\n\nSo, when he was about 3 or 4 we had an aupaire for my younger siblings, I was home from boarding school (we weren't actually rich, upper middle class, but my parents basically put all of their money into trying to culture us up real nice) and I had gone to go get a cheesesteak and some pizza from a local place while the aupaire was hanging out with RR in the yard.  While I was gone RR had apparently decided he wanted to battle with a bicyclist and in doing so made a beeline for the street.  The aupaire who was fond of him and didn't want him to end up squished grabbed his collar while he was running to prevent this and he reflexively bit her hand.  I basically came home right after and the dog was inside trying to look pathetic while she was sitting on the front stoop cursing at him in Swedish.  I go inside, put my food on the kitchen table and go outside to try and console her with the fact that it was probably not premeditated on his part and that he had done it reflexively.  After a few minutes of \"fooking leetle shiit\" she calmed down and realized the bite hadn't broken the skin so she was probably going to be able to forgive him.  We went inside to find that he had somehow managed to climb up onto the kitchen table (remember he is a dachshund so we are talking about a dog that is about 8 inches off the ground) eat a cheese steak that was basically his size, then for good measure eat the cheese off of the pizza because he was too full to eat the crust, and he was lying on his bed looking painfully satisfied.  Needless to say the whole scene completely mollified the aupaire who burst out laughing, and I had to find something else to eat for dinner.\n\nTLDR: my dog basically staged a one dachshund version of the Italian Job to steal my dinner", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329324992", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It seems to me that people from all across the fanbase of Radiohead have some gross misconceptions about Oasis and Noel Gallagher.\n\nFirst and foremost, Noel clearly likes Radiohead (some of their material, anyway) or at least respects them for what they are.\n\n&gt;**\"I like them. Every time I see them live they blow me away\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Granted, some of the stuff on Amnesiac is brilliant. The Bends is the bollocks. Karma Police is mega\"**\n\n&gt;“I think I could have said, without any argument, till the year 2000 Oasis were the most important British band since The Beatles. **But I think Radiohead have been important** [nowadays].\"\n\n&gt;\"We've got great songs with fooking great lyrics. The same goes for the Artic Monkeys and **Radiohead - they wouldn't still be here if not for their bloody lyrics**!\"\n\n&gt;\"To be honest, to me it looked like marketing – a great way of getting a load of marketing for free really. **But good for them. That’s what they do, they’re rebels and outsiders.**”\n\n&gt;\"I don't own any of their records, but every time I've seen them live, they've fucking blown me away. It was like, \"Wow, fucking listen to that! How do you fucking make that shit come out of those speakers?\" It's fucking amazing. But have I ever had a moment where I fucking sat down and thought, \"Do you know what this calls for? This calls for 'Paranoid Android!' Get it on!\" No. I've never had that moment. Give me \"Mony Mony\" or \"Runaround Sue.\" Something you can sing to.\"\n\nSecondly, you have got to understand that Oasis and Radiohead are, in more than one way, at either of the spectrum. Their attitude's towards the definition of a \"good\" band or \"good\" music are clearly like chalk and cheese, there are bound to be some conflicts. \n\nOasis played rock'n'roll, singing about cigarettes, alcohol, footy and the working class, everyday problems. They were all about massive, stadium-pleasing tunes, having a good time; reinventing music or experimenting, evolving - not so much.\n\n&gt;\"We don't need to prove anything to anyone. At the end of the day you can go to a Radiohead show and stroke your fucking beard and watch the miserable cunt complaining, or come see us, put your arm round your best mate and have it. Is anyone making mind-bending music anymore? We're a rock'n'roll group.\"\n\n&gt;\"Musically we're not going to try anything too radical. We aren't the type of people who spend all the time doing crazy experimental stuff!\"\n\n&gt;“We all know that, Mr Yorke. Who wants to sing the news?\"\n\n&gt;\"They seem so pissed off being in a band. That doesn't inspire kids to pick up guitars. They're moaning about the marketing, the videos. If I was 15 I'd think, I'll get a job down the car wash. \"\n\nWhether you agree with him or not is, to my mind, as irrelevant as the question \"What is the point of art?\". People listen to music for a variety of different reasons, the fact that **you** personally don't, for instance, dance to music, shouldn't encourage you slag off dancers. \n\n&gt;It you want rock'n'roll that can lift you up out of your everyday life but not so far that it makes you want to slash your fuckin' wrists, if you want songs to drink to, if you want songs to put your arm 'round your girlfriend or your best mate to, then it doesn't get any better than us. **If you want progressive fuckin's forward-thinking rock music, there's Radiohead.**\n\nI think people are judging Oasis (and Noel) way too harshly. If you at all like the pre-Kid A-era Radiohead, I strongly recommend you seek out Oasis' first two and last two records, you ARE missing out.\n\nOn the topic of the Gallaghers being obsessed with Radiohead: even the quote you yourself pasted here illustrates nicely how these quotes come to be.

{"body": "1. Ashley is still recovering after an injury - that he was on the bench was surprising and a stroke of good luck, as it turned out. If you were expecting him to start, I'm sure you must have cursed AVB when Essien was on the bench for the first time after his injury lay-off.\n\n2. Ditto for Essien. He's been out of action for six months. If you expect him to come back firing on all cylinders, I don't know what to say... \n\n3. Meireles was poor today but I doubt it has anything to do with him being Portuguese. Then again, Ramires was shit today and he speaks Portuguese, too. So does Luiz who was the culprit for the goal. Maybe there is something to the Portuguese theory. But wait, Brana screwed up too but he isn't Portuguese! Drogba was shit and he's nowhere close to a Portuguese! Neither is Danny - he's fookin' English and he has been playing shit for the past few games! What is this sorcery? O_o (/s)\n\nI hate saying this but insinuating that the Manager chooses players because they are a certain nationality is almost racist. \n\nWe are all disheartened by the pathetic, passionless display we've seen over the last few games.
