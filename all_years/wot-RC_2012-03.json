{"body": "Stay away from credit cards. Or at least, only use them when you know you can pay off the balance as soon as you get the statement/see your purchase added. \n\nIt's really tempting to say 'oh I'll pay if off when I next get paid' because you haven't got quite enough for a large purchase right now.. or you really want that takeaway tonight but funds are low. But come payday you will have found something else you want to spend that money on and it will be super tempting to only pay off some of the balance. And then you have to account for wild and unexpected bills. So don't do that.\n\nCredit card debt can build quite quickly, or gradually, depending on how reckless you are. It really sucks when you realise it's going to take you months or *years* to pay back that money. In the end it's only delaying the pain, credit cards are not free money!\n\n Paying off credit cards and loans sucks especially bad because the money is going into some hole and you're not getting anything tangible out of it - it's paying for things that have already been and gone most likely. While you're paying these bills each month you'll still be wanting to live your life and probably finding more things you want to buy, but now can not afford. Unless you whip out the plastic again... it's a vicious cycle that can be very hard to break.\n\nSaving up and waiting instead means you'll spend less overall, have less stress, won't be held to a tyranny of debt and you will enjoy your purchase more. Psychologically, dropping a large hunk of saved up money rather than getting into a big debt and slowly paying it off is just nicer. Personally it also makes me value the money more, so I am more careful with what I'm buying. I'm shit with money, can you tell? I like spending but I've learnt the hard way that this is not sustainable!\n\nVehicles are fooking expensive, don't get one unless you *really* need it. Once you have one it will be hard to return to life without. They cost money to buy, to run and to maintain and they also add to the risk of getting wild and unexpected bills.\n\nYou say you can cook already, keep that up. Allow some takeaways of course but the habits you form now will be hard to break, so make them good ones.\n\nYou might have to buy stuff for your home - furnishings, random household tools, bed linen and towels etc. As far as you are able, buy good stuff and only buy when you are convinced you *really* need it. When I first moved out I was broke so I bought a lot of cheap stuff that had to be replaced, which is a waste of time and money. I also bought some stuff that just didn't get used and became clutter until I gave up and chucked it. Let your parents guide you with this one. This is especially true for kitchen equipment where it's really easy to get excited and buy a lot of crap you will use once or never. Be minimalistic as possible, that way you can buy the best quality stuff.\n\nGrocery shopping can be exciting to start with, but it's usually boring. If you go when you are hungry or without a list you will buy twice as much, you'll probably find that most of it isn't mealworthy and you will wind up back in the shop a day or two later for all the things you missed. \n\nEven if you think you're only going to the shop to buy *one* emergency item you may well get suckered into buying more that you didn't know you needed! Plus if you need transport that costs too, you really want to minimise grocery store trips. You also don't want to find yourself eating takeaway six days in a row because you didn't get anything from the store for meals, and you can't face going to the store after work.\n\nIt's good to buy some things in bulk to make them cheaper and reduce wild and unexpected emergencies. Running out of toilet roll is never good. On the flipside, many supermarket multi-buy deals do not save you enough money to make it worth buying extra, especially for consumables that you use more of if you have more in the house.\n\nLearn to work out what you *need* and what you just *want*. Learn to make yourself wait for things you want, it's a great way to iron out impulsive spends.\n\nWe all like our luxuries in life but if you make a habit of something, you'll find it hard to give up later on. So unless it's something you really think is justifiable then do not get into bad habits with expensive things. I'm thinking bought lunches, Starbucks every morning, the expensive brands of x or y.\n\nTry not to get into the habit of buying too much in the way of junk food and snacks, it's expensive and you will get fat.\n\nCleaning and household chores are boring but look at it like this: you like the place you're in, and you want to keep it nice, right? They are far less miserable and time consuming if you do them regularly instead of waiting until your place becomes a biohazard.\n\nI don't know what your local climate is like, where I live in the winter it's easy for a nice place to get humid and mouldy. A way to avoid this is by opening windows and avoiding having too much densely packed clutter in a room. Opening the windows is a real easy way to freshen up your home, by the way, ventilation matters! Oh and if the place you're moving into smells musty, it will stay that way, don't be tricked into thinking it's just because it's been empty.

{"body": "Aer Lingus is hilarious.  On my last flight from Dublin to NYC, I was sitting near the front and the pilot came out 45 minutes or so in and asked if he could look out my window 'to check the wing.'  He leans forwards, shrugs and says 'Looks good to me.  That wee flock of geese didn't know what hit 'em!'  And off he went.  I also once was getting off one of their regional flights and (fyi: I'm a bit of an aviation nerd) out of interest, I asked on the way out why he had chosen not to deploy the thrust reversers on landing, thinking it was some technical decision.  Nope.  He blushed and looked away while the copilot snorted trying not to laugh.  That was of course very reassuring.\n\nIf you've ever flown into Belfast City airport, it's pretty nuts.  The runway is shorter than a midget's dick so they come in really, really low, which means that until quite literally the last second it looks like you're coming down in Belfast Lough.  Also the flight path takes you along what must be the bumpiest route of all time.  Every mountain and coastline possible gets to join the party.  I was once seated next to someone who was terrified of flying, and after I spent the first half hour drawing diagrams to demonstrate how it was impossible to open the cabin doors during flight, I advised her to start drinking now before the descent.  She did.\n\nI was also once on a plane from London where a fight broke out between a huge family and a bunch of angry men.  It deteriorated to the point where one of the angry men said 'Damn Taigs (Catholics) need to learn their fookin' place.'  Big mistake.  HUGE.  3/4 of the men on the plane stood up and rolled up their sleeves, the angry men suddenly looked genuinely afraid, and the captain had to turn on the seatbelt sign and order everyone to sit the fuck down.  When we left the plane, the crew kept the group of angry men there and I saw airport police coming the other way down the jetway.  I'll be honest, though, being arrested was probably the best thing that could have happened for them, because when I came through baggage claim all the offended men from the plane were waiting there with their sleeves rolled up, glowering at the door.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331592729", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Give me ein Becks, ya ist Der real King of beers, danke.\"\nPaddy, CEO of Guinness, steps forward \"Barman, would ya give me a doyet coke wid ice and lemon. Tanks.\"\nThe others stare at him in stunned silence, amazement written all over their faces. Eventually Bruce asks, \"Are you not going to have a Guinness, Pat?\"\nPaddy replies: \"Well, if you fookin' pansies aren't drinkin', then neither am I\".\n\nPretty decent I thought. But the best part? The top response to the joke: \n&gt;Guinness actually has less alcohol in it compared to the others\nGuiness Extra Stout - 4.23% Alcohol, Budwiser - 4.82%, Foster's - 5.25%, Beck's - 5.13%\n\nWhich was featured on the front page [earlier today in a TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/r4z8a/til_guinness_is_a_light_beer_with_less_calories/). *We've come full circle.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332300773", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
