{"body": "During the university term holidays  (in the U.k)when I'm back home i would walk my dog about 5 times a day (so I can have a cheeky cigarette without family finding out) I am 5.10 with a rather thin stature with long hair, not the most intimidating person in the world. My dog is a Doberman and is the most placid dog I have ever known he is ten years old and has grown up with toddlers pulling his ears poking his eyes, the whole works and never cared, he has fathered 34 pups in total and lived with three other dogs in this time, never has he even growled. Yet a man in the park opposite my house had the cheek to say that he should be put down because he is a guard dog and vicious, this all came about because while his dogs were off the lead they tried to bite mine. He has three stocky bulldogs and the man himself is early 40's and a grumpy arsehole. The next day I'm at the park my dog is on the lead again, the man walks into the park this time walks up to me and threatens to break my dogs spine if he goes near his, i tell him i will call the police to which he replies \"my house is worth £750,000 and my dogs are worth £1000 each who is going to believe a greasy cunt like you\" unfortunately for him the local police officer for my area is a friend of mine and when i called the police and explain everything to the policeman when he comes to see me later that day, He tells me that i am well within my right from now on to protect my dog from him. A week goes past without seeing him again until the last day before I am meant to be returning to uni, I'm walking my dog in the park when yet again the man walks in with his dogs this time he comes storming up to me threatening to kill my dog for calling the police on him, there was an elderly couple in the park so I didn't want to make a scene but my anger boiled over as he walked up to me i simply looked up at him calmly, and punched him square in the face as hard as i possibly could, he falls to the ground clutching his nose as blood comes out of it screaming about how i will be arrested, i walk over to the elderly couple to apologise but before i can, they tell me they have witnessed his aggression to other dog owners before and thought it was great someone finally put him in his place.
