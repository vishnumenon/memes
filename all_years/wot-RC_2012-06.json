{"body": "&gt;On the quoted text, of course I make no comparison to following materialistic life! I agree with your point. I should have stated the context was normal every day people. People typically find it easier to remember materialistic things as they have a material reference. But remembering the feeling of an OBE or vivid meditation is hard for them. In fact because it's so subjective I find it hard to describe with words! This was the meaning I was going for here. If I was to open the subject more I'd be happy to indulge that internal/materialistic either way - maybe it's just that people've learnt the materialistic way better to associate experiences. I could imagine both could be achieved - but certainly people typically lean towards esoteric experiences being hard to understand mostly.\n\nI can somewhat cautiously agree with this.  It's never been very hard for me to remember my meditational or mystical experiences and I come from a fairly materialistic background myself.  The way I interpret what you're saying is that while the ability to remember mystical experiences is the same for all people, the materialists may remember less simply due to a lack of interest and due to a somewhat contradictory or intellectually inconvenient nature of such experiences.  So it's not so much that they can't remember, but perhaps they don't want to or would rather not remember such things.\n\nAlso, while I am OK with the idea of sharing your beliefs and methods with others, I am not OK with proselytizing.  We shouldn't be pushing our way of thinking and our way of life onto people.  If the right context arises it's perfectly OK, I think, to delve into an occult concept or two with just about anyone.  But to aggressively evangelize and spread the occult beliefs and to essentially take this way of life and make another fooking religion out of it, that's completely unacceptable to me.  Religions have tremendously plagued this planet as it is.  The last thing we should do is add another religion to the pile.\n\nI guess what I am saying is, it's a good idea to share but not in any kind of overbearing way and not by yelling on a street corner (out of context, out of the blue).

For the most part our otter layer of skin stops it. Furthermore, we're always getting radiation exposure, whether we live near a nuclear facility or not. The average dose for me living at an altitude of 7500 ft. is about 400-500mrem per year. This is largely from the sun and being in a seismically active area (yay sunburns...).

He states that CPM cannot be converted to biological hazard, and that that depends only the type of radiation and the energy imparted.  He then goes on to say that the type of radiation indicated by the given CPM would indicate gamma radiation, which is *by far* the most dangerous kind of radiation.\n\n**tl;dr**: He states that CPM cannot indicate biological hazard and that we shouldn't be worried, follows up in the same post by indicating that the measured CPM implies a kind of radiation that constitutes a biological hazard.\n\n[Here's a link about the various health effects of different kinds of radiation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray#Health_effects).\n\nConcerning the validity of the OP: as I said earlier, I believe he's found something with an honest explanation and is going overboard about it.  He's obviously paranoid, which he admits to.  However, the \"Google coverup\" is a lack of Google-Fu on his part, and there were posts of nuclear training exercise in the area, which could explain any unmarked military vehicles.  The iodine comments are a widely-believed-to-be-effective treatment by those constituting the paranoid crowd.  **That said, attacks on OP's character do not make his findings any less legitimate.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339183371", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Citations from OP include an easily doctored screenshot and vague insinuations about a data coverup, coupled with an immediate and baseless dismissal of the explanation for the anomalous reading given by the site in question. Most of the rest are \"black helicopter\" and \"ZOMG military vehicles!\".\n\nHis only other source for WAY higher than normal radiation levels was pretty thoroughly debunked (in comments I ETA on my earlier post), and has now confirmed in multiple places that in fact his sensor is malfunctioning. (https://twitter.com/#!/joey_stanford)\n\nFoofooking's comments about CPM are pretty valid. CPM cannot be easily converted into any kind of dosage number without some detailed information about the sensor type used and its calibration state, information which OP does not have for the sensor that triggered his paranoia. However, with that data CPM can easily be converted into a pretty good approximation of a biological dosage. You didn't link to any of the comments in question, would be nice if you could do that.\n\nFurthermore, OP severely damages his credibility by selectively editing posts to only include supportive evidence, and by including the conspiracy theory woo (especially the iodine thing which is not only woo, with no proven beneficial effects for \"any\" radiation as OP claimed, but it is physically dangerous and can harm someone) alongside what might possibly be decent information. It is not an attack on the OP's character to point out the *extremely* suspicious evidence he has been posting along with everything else. I didn't do anything other than point out some of the more unbelievable or suspicious things he posted from the beginning. If you feel I attacked his character *as proof* in this thread, I'd love for you to point it out, so I can correct it, as it was unintentional.\n\nAll that said: I tend to agree with your last paragraph. Something radiological may have caused that spike. Maybe its something they cannot explain, and so are looking for an explanation. Or maybe the sensor did malfunction to cause the super high spike, and other possibly \"elevated\" readings are a result of something else, maybe solar?  I tend to lean towards the solar explanation being the most plausible, excepting the possibility that this entire thing is an elaborately orchestrated hoax ala the George Mason University \"Lying about the past\" course.  But I will reserve final judgement between those two possibilities, and the third \"something I didn't think of\" for the time being.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339186053", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

The man was a rock, but unlike other similar players, he was also cheeky and cunning. He was smart and he knew how to play on each of his opponents weaknesses. Every Serie A striker was affraid of him... and for good reason.\n\n As for Recoba, what can I say? He was a beast. Underachiever or not, the way he struck the ball was and still is unique... those 30m curlers were a joy to behold. I loved every second of his playtime, and as a Juventus fan, that's saying something.

Im talking about people that wait around the burg, the kiln, or anor londo with the intention of having a duel. Im not talking about invading IN GENERAL, thats a different story, you do what you have to do to live and continue the quest to the boss. The above post is just type of behavior what Is expected in an honor duel.\n\"Fuck my guide\"? \"No code of honor\" you say? \nSo someone answer me this. Why is it ganking is frowned upon? The answer, bc its unfair and dishonorable, every player knows that.\nSecond question, If theres no code of honor for HONOR DUELS, why is it if I so much as fart wrong in a match causing me to win, I ALWAYS receive a message from the loser saying 'u flasked, u lag stabbed, u spammed R1, u WoTG spammed, u didnt even greet me'.\nI use to play like a cheapskate and i got a message like this every match I won. Now that I dont play like that, it is super rare to get a msg unless it is someone complimenting me. \n\n\nTHE ANSWER: if you are invading someones world who is awaiting honor duels, you are expected to honor duel him. whether of not that was your intention. They expect a certain type of etiquette. I will always oblige bc I am a fair person, and I am with honor. But If I enter your world and youre ganking, I will react like a cornered animal and climb you to survive. This is also the time I practice my trolling techniques.

{"body": "Mmmm, that's a tough question to answer for me.  I feel like it's too much of a cop out to say \"all of them\" but honestly I pretty much fell in love with WW and the WoD ever since I was bought 1st edition of WtA.  If pressed I'd probably go with WtA and WtF since werewolf was my first love.  Mage was amazing (and so much fun to play/DM) in oWoD that I'd probably put that into number 2 and vampire/changling/wraith into a tie for number 3.\n\n**Vampire** - the \"vampheroes\" effect of the latter books kinda turned me off, while at the the same time made me fall in love with the likes of Ur-shulgi and the story possibilities of such ancient and powerful vampires.  Kinda miss the god-hooded ancient vampires in the nWoD, but I see why they went for the change.  You were very shoe horned into a certain power level in the oWoD vampire that *never* would change unless you wanted to break every single \"law\" and diablerize your way up (fookin auspex and tainted aura's).\n\n**Changling** - I actually really liked the setting but it was never super supported by WW and I never ended up with more then the 1st edition printing.  It also seemed to clash with the WoD as they painted the fairie realm as more of a fantastical setting seeming more in line with Exalted then the WoD.\n\n**Wraith** -  Simply amazing.  It was a stunning portrait of lost souls fighting against oblivion.  However it was basically a total RP setting, and being teenage boys things like WtA and Mage seemed to fit the action bill that me and my friends craved at the time.  Would love to break out my first edition and go to town now.\n\n**Mage** - No need to say anything, if you knew the oWoD you know how much fun this was to play.  \n\n**Werewolf** - Right fighting werewolves who held on to their humanity (mostly) while fighting the evil machinations of the Wyrm?  How can you not just fall instantly in love.\n\n**hunter** -  Loved it, but liked to play WtA if I needed to feel like a \"good\" guy.  Exception would be \"demon hunter X\".  Holy shit, I loved me some demon hunter X\n\nSpeaking of which....\n\n**kindred of the east** -  So god damned good.  Probably my all time favorite setting in the WoD.  Man oh man, I cannot describe my love of KotE.  It was so damned good.  Ugg, I literally cannot put down my love of the KotE setting into typing, I loved it that much.\n\n**nWoD** - Actually hated it when first exposed to it.  like really hated it.  I disliked how much everything had changed.  But then...I started to see it.  It started to make sense.   Then it all started to become clear.  It was better, not just a little bit but by a whole other measuring stick.  They gave each setting the feel of the old Wraith (by RP standards) while still allowing the same action packed stories of the vampheroes vain if wanted.  It's hard to now even go back to the old books and not cringe a little when seeing how...childish(?) they seem.  \n\n\nSpecial mention goes to...**Exalted**\n\nstunning setting and rule set.  First edition was arguably better then second edition.  It allowed you to play all you favorite oWoD characters  in a setting that allowed and even begged for the the extreme.  It's a great example of a storytelling concept unleashed to it's extreme.  It worked so well I can hardly believe it.  It's that good (first edition at least).\n\n\nWow that was a long answer to your question, lol.  let me know if you have any other questions! :D   \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339562429", "subreddit": "lfg", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
