IMO the following are important to defending MCOM;\n\nHAve a spawn beacon and Tugs set up close but not close enough to be destroyed by mortars/tank rounds blasting the immediate area.\n\nDeal with AMTRAC's A.S.A.P....People ignore these fucking things like they are chameleons and they are the most important weapon an attacking team has in rush, IMO.\n\nRun smoke grenades.....if you need to disarm--pop one.

Also use these to revive..Revive is very important in Rush..for both teams.\n\nStay close to the objective...especially if you are the last squad member alive..make your way back there if so.\n\nLike the Amtrac..take down choppers ASAP..if an MCOM is set and they have an attack chopper above it, you may as well kiss it goodbye.\n\nKeep your vehicles as defensive tools and stay close to objectives..don't pile forward using them to base camp the attackers;1. they are way less likely to be destroyed..2.They are essential to the defense.\n\nSpeaking of vehicles.....Before you spawn always have a quick look at the defender deployment before jumping on a team mate..I often see Defender tanks left unmanned in Rush mode.\n\nWell that's all I can think of right now...and probably all you care to read anyhow, I'm dragging on a bit.\n\nRush defense for me is the most frustrating game mode I play....It's also BY FAR, the most rewarding!\n\nEDIT: Oops...meant to reply to OP...

The plan is to have unrolled exits around Emporia do that people from NC are able to still come to VA for cheaper gas. So since trucks are tolled more they're more likely to take 301 instead of paying the toll since it literally parallels I-95 there.

After the debacle of the \"late 80's Hair-Bands\" came what I felt was music which was kind of stripped down and frequently without much depth (not getting into lyrics here - which are also generally dismal).\n\nAs I had trained my ears to be able to pick out what each instrument was playing on any given recording, I analyzed what \"the young folks\" in the 90's were coming up with creatively, and I found most of it surprisingly lacking.\n\nYoung people are generally predisposed to \"like\" music created by other young people, so due to that trait, marketing and PR, and other related factors, the music of the 90's till now has been consistently accepted by the typical consumer. However, armed with decades of study, I felt that post 80's music was being created by people with less and less skills and the overall intention of musical creators was not consistent with factors that led to the creation of \"popular\" music since the 1920's. \n(yeah, I could write a fookin' book....).\n\nLook, I don't want to rain on anyone's parade. Music, for me, really is THE highlight of being alive. Almost everyone loves music, and few want to hear their sacred cows turned into ground beef with E. coli...\n\nMy point would be: WAKE UP!!! DIG DEEP! LISTEN! STUDY!
