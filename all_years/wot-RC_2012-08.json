{"body": "(page 3)\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojjpd?context=1) (Curious_will):**\n\n&gt; Hey i love your comics whenever a new one is put out it really makes my day at work fly by. My question is, what is your schedule for putting new comics out and what can we (reddit and users) do to see new comics more frequently?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojral?context=1) (WinstonRowntree):**\n\n&gt; Hey, cheers. My schedule's informally every two weeks, but the nature of doing freelance work means that a strict schedule isn't really possible. I have to take the opportunities that come my way when they come my way because that's what pays the rent. My non-subnormality work isn't some burden that holding me back though, i don't wanna give that impression in the least. I really Love being commissioned to draw stuff, it's a necessary diversion from the usual drawing+writing, and working with Cracked.com is pretty much a dream job to me and i'm perpetually mega-grateful for that opportunity.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could *probably* pay the rent via ads on my site or whatever, but i have no desire to go down that road, so there's always gonna be a balance between the comic and the Everything Else. As to what you can do to see new comix more frequently, there's really nothing beyond just supporting the site, posting links to my work or leaving comments or whathaveyou. Just let me know you're out there! Unless you have some sort of cloning machine? I'd need more than one clone though, i'd need like a couple.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojivv?context=1) (KnitAJesso):**\n\n&gt; What is your favorite Subnormality strip? Which one are you most proud of?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also: It's such a treat when a new comic pops up in the feed. It makes me happy and I want to say that I don't even care about waiting between comics if it means they are all such treats &amp;lt;3\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojv2w?context=1) (WinstonRowntree):**\n\n&gt; Thanks! That means a lot me. Which comix am i most proud of? Honestly, just the ones that were the most work i think, and that the most people enjoyed. I'm proud of [The Line](http://www.viruscomix.com/page474.html) because it was the culmination of a few years of pondering such issues and because of the research involved. And i'm proud of [the one christmas comic](http://www.viruscomix.com/page505.html) because it was basically a graphic novel that i'd been mulling for a couple years but  was never going to have the opportunity to draw, so i tried to kind of pour it into one installment of a weekly comic strip and i'm proud of myself that i was willing to try something like that, if i may say so. (and the mousover text for that one is completely true by the way-- i was literally inking the words \"the power went off\" and in real life the power went off, and it was the fucking Creepiest Thing Ever)\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojkyh?context=1) (d36williams):**\n\n&gt; Remember your 7 part space opera?

I won't be for a while though.

My merch is all online anyway, so it'd just be me at an empty table with a false moustache pretending to be asleep.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojojs?context=1) (s0me_m0r0n):**\n\n&gt; where do all the stories go? will the brown haired girl ever go crazy from stewardess-ing, and take Sphynx on some sort of BJ and the Bear inspired killing spree? What about the Sand Witch? Does the homeless woman who sells band names ever show up at the same street corner as the guy who said condoms are manufactured to break, and start a turf war? what do the other monsters from the \"monsters playing cards\" comic do?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ok3a5?context=1) (WinstonRowntree):**\n\n&gt; Killing spree not scheduled. As for the other stories, they're ongoing... And the ones that aren't, hopefully there's enough there to be worth pondering about, imagination-wise. There are some i've meant to return to but haven't yet, Atomic Cowgirl being top of that list.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5oju66?context=1) (masayume):**\n\n&gt; Who are the three artists you look up to that first come up to your mind (and why) ?\n&gt; Awesome work, thanks so much. I adore your \"Weird\" print I bought some time ago. \n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ok7nu?context=1) (WinstonRowntree):**\n\n&gt; Thanks for the kind words, and for buying a print! Three artists:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Bill Watterson is Why I Make Comics. He was able to transcend the idiotic constraints of newspapers (and in fact fight for more room on the sunday pages) and produce something amazing and near-timeless just by sheer talent and love for the medium. Basically everything i do derives from idolizing Watterson. I make damn sure to use the infinite canvas now available to me thanks to the internet. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Kurt Cobain! Huge influence, artistically and as a person. I was obsessed with that dude for a great many years. His hatred of Macho Bullshit i happily absorbed. \"Heavier Than Heaven\" by Charles R. Cross is the only book i've read more than once.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Noel Gallagher! Because of songs like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4GZVxf0RK4) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaeLKhRnkhQ) and because he's said numerous times he's doing what he's doing because he can't do anything else, and i'm in the same boat. I can't do a real job, so here i am.  Fookin' 'ell.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ojuhk?context=1) (activeoctopuss):**\n\n&gt; You're work is awesome. Not just the artwork, it's the message. I just wanted to say you inspire me.\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xpvnj/_/c5ok89v?context=1) (WinstonRowntree):**\n\n&gt; Thanks! I'm pretty inspired by such kind words in return.\n\n*****\n\n(continued below)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344192755", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I pretty much have my dream guitar(s) and i fooking love em to bits. I can get almost any sound possible out of them too, largely due to the 6 way varitone swtich it has. I have an Epi ES-345 (the 1955 reissue range) and tho the standard set up was turd i modded it out with all the best gear and its unreal. Ive played a few Gibson ES-335's and mine sounds worlds better. Took out the standard PUP's and put some Bareknuckle \"Riff Raff\" Humbuckers in (Like Noel Gallagher uses on his), changed the machine heads and it's good to go! It's the perfect blues guitar. Ahh so the bigsby isnt the best tremelo bar in the world, but in cherry red and gold finish it looks to die for. \n\nMy second dream guitar is my fucking stunning Epi Les Paul Black Beauty. Again turd standard set up as i had to have the frets levelled and action tweaked loads to get in the perfect position. But hey its sorted now and i feel right at home on it. As you can tell i'm a bit mad with the customisation. And yes i've replaced all 3 pickups - x2 Bareknuckle \"The Mule\" Humbuckers in the bridge and neck and one Mississippi Queen Humbucker sized P90 in the middle. This combined with the jimmy page 6 way toggle switch and a load of other cool shit. It just sounds awesome.
