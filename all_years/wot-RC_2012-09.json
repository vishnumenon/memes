{"body": "It is a cold winter in London when some new neighbors move in. It is clear from day 1 that they are going to be trouble. I introduce myself and try to play nice. I want to appear as if I'm on their side, because I know how these things go.\n\nFirst night, it's a party. And the second. And the third. I give them the weekend to adjust, before I tell them to keep it down, but other neighbors have already begun to complain. They say okay, but they clearly don't care.\n\nOne night, while I'm out, my girlfriend asks nicely if they can keep it down. They threaten and harass her in a way that makes her scared and upset. She doesn't tell me this, yet.\n\nA night or two later, they are making noise again. I start with knocking on the door and ask politely if they can keep it down, since we have to work. Despite my attempts to be cool, they are immediately total dicks.\n\n\"Ows bout we fookin smash you den?\" Is all I could decipher. They took it personally, being told to keep quiet. It becomes clear that I will have to escalate. I've spent some time in some lawless places, but my girlfriend does well to remind me of the \"civilized\" process. She is also concerned they might try to hurt me.\n\nSo, I do the right thing. The landlord does nothing, the police do nothing and my little apartment complex in Surrey Quays is getting less and less sleep. 2 am, a couple of weeks later, rolls around, my girlfriend can't sleep and I finally get permission to do things my way. That is when she tells me how they treated her.\n\nIt was unsettling to my girlfriend at how much I enjoy this sort of thing. But I spent the next day preparing.\n\nDuct Tape. Check.\nNails. Check.\nEmpty cola bottles. Check.\nDry Ice. Check.\nLead pipes and caps. Check.\nA collapsing circuit (Le pièce de résistance). Check.\n\nThe plan was simple. Convince the police that these assholes, who had intimidated my neighbors long enough, that they were actually and truly a problem that needed to be handled immediately.\n\nStep 1. Bring over beer and weed. I tell them I've got nothing better to do, and we should get a little fucked up. They are skeptical until they see the joint. We proceed to get fucked up.\n\nStep 2. Leave the pipe, caps, nails, duct tape,and home-made collapsing circuit in their bathroom, while I take a leak.\n\nStep3. Tell them I am going to sleep, but, in fact, go outside to  cap the dry ice bombs. I made three. Nothing fancy... but really, really loud.\n\nStep 4. Call the police as the first explosion happens. Tell them they are throwing explosives off of their balcony. One actually goes off while I'm on the phone with them. I'm not the only one who calls, either.\n\nThe response, this time, was, maybe, 5 minutes. And they just kept coming. Our offending neighbors were hauled off with everyone watching. Considering how long they rifled through their apartment, I can only assume they found, what appeared to be, the beginnings of a dangerous device.\n\nThey never returned.\n\ntl;dr Arab looking neighbors don't get a whole lot of leeway with the police in London when there are explosives involved.

{"body": "Incidentally, he was convicted under Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, apparently Section 1a:\n\n*(1)A person is guilty of an offence if he—\n(a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character;*\n\nthere's a bit about it [on the CPS website](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/):\n\n&gt; The Communications Act 2003 section 127 covers the sending of improper messages. Section 127(1)(a) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and emails.\n\nSo it would appear this is a overly loosely drafted law that is intended to be used against people who send others abusive letters or emails.  It was the same piece of law that was used to convict the Robin Hood airport tweeter. I suspect when it was written, either in the lead up to 2003 or previous to that (and inherited from a previous law), Facebook and Twitter were not mainstream, or perhaps didn't exist at all, so this idea of moving 'pub chatter' level conversation into written and electronic communication didn't exist.\n\nAlso, I found [this blog](http://www.pitkanary.com/category/commuications-act/), whose author went to the trial. There's some interesting stuff on there:\n\n&gt; A further statement came from one Samir Ahmed (no relation). **Less than three hours after Azhar Ahmed’s Facebook post, an address and telephone number had been published on Facebook by persons unspecified, which purported to be Azhar Ahmed’s details. They were actually Samir Ahmed’s details, and in the following few hours, starting from around 22:00 hours, they received a deluge of abusive phone calls, mostly racial in content. These continued relentlessly for hours. At around midnight,  cars started pulling up outside the house, and torches were shone in through windows.** This went on until past 1:00am the following day. The witness testified that they have since had to change their telephone number.\n\nAnd linked from there, [this article](http://harrypaterson.co.uk/politics-current-affairs/a-tale-of-two-states-azhar-ahmed-and-scott-mchugh) about responses to Ahmed's post:\n\n* On March 12th, one Scott McHugh, who appears to be a serving soldier, posted on his Facebook wall, in response to Ahmed’s comments, “Azhar ahmed you sick horrible twisted paki bastard, how can you say that about our soldiers!” McHugh was joined by several of his friends, some of whom commented as follows…\n\n* Leighanne Gillott: ” He’s disgusting and should be fucking hanged!! **He won’t get away with it, locked up or not somebody will get him, he will get what he deserves!!x”**\n\n* Lee Crisculo: **”Fucking sick twat burn his eyes out smelly fukka”**\n\n* Helen Massey Gordge:  ”Cheeky smelly pakki cunt wants tying to a tree n shooting …Smelly fukker..Lock him up n throw the key away ..Grrrhhhh….SKUM…!!”\n\n* Robbie Joedys Sampler: ” He’s nothing he’s gunner die veryy soon”\n\n* Danielle Lufc Harker: **”Dirty smelly greasy bastard needs fuking torturing the dirty paki bastard!!”**\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of these people come up on Google News as having been pursued by the police, even though their offenses in my opinion are significantly more serious (involving direct threats and incitement to violence).

{"body": "Good for you mate! I never liked to weed, then a strange thing happened. I planted my first garden over the summer. I was/am outside every day for at least 20-30 min. The garden is all natural, manure, no pesticides. It was tough at first. The garden was unused for years and over grown. It was like a weed battle royal. But I kept on top of it. Weeded a little every day. The weeds kept coming back, but slower, and less every time. Then about a month ago I noticed my garden is weed free.\n\nSo I moved on to the flower beds. I fooking love weeding now, it is almost like a daily meditation for me. I can collect my thoughts or forget everything and unlike our digital escapes (computer/tv) I actually have tangible results!\n\nI am convinced there is no secret to a great looking yard. It will take a lot of work at the start. But once you reach the point where your neighbors are jealous. Then it takes maybe 1-2 hours a week. Less if you are strategic with your planting to keep it up to shape.
