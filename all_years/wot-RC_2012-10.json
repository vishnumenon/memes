{"body": "&gt;You have no idea what guns are except from movies don't you? \n\nActually I've been trained to kill people with them. My training sergeant made very clear to us that we couldn't outrun bullets. \n\n&gt;Good luck trying to run from someone with a knife as a woman if they are a man and have gotten close enough to pull it out and threaten you with it.\n\nYou think a gun will give you a better chance?\n\n&gt;Lafayette Police Lieutenant Brad Bishop says in police training on use of force, officers learn about the \"21-foot rule.\" The rule states a person with a knife can cover 21 feet in about 1.5 to 2.5 seconds, being able to stab a victim faster than an officer can get his gun from the holster and shoot it. And that's under ideal circumstances.\n\nhttp://www.wlfi.com/dpp/news/crime/21-foot-rule-shows-danger-of-knives\n\nUnless you're going to pull that gun on everyone who comes within 21 feet of you... you're better off to leave it in its holster and attempt to gain control of the attackers weapon. Self defence training can help with that. Gets you fit too.\n\n&gt;So they aren't too pussy to violently rape and murder someone, but using a knife crosses the line?\n\nNo, they are pussies, not squeamish. They are afraid that a knife won't give them enough of an advantage, not that it would be too messy.\n\n&gt;Damn straight they did.\n\nI'll see your graph and raise you one:\n\n[Homicide Rates](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/America-is-violent-graph.png)\n\nNotice that the 70's had more murders than at any time since? How does that fit your world view?\n\n[Gun Ownership](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/gun-ownership-declining1.png)\n\nHey look! Less people own guns in the US now than in the 1970's! So fewer people with more guns. That's so much safer!\n\n&gt;Fun fact, Australia always had a lower homicide rate then the US even before your absurd new gun laws.\n\nTrue, but that's not a good thing. Your gun control laws are only recent as well, and they are far less strict. So why am I not surprised that Australia has less homicides?\n\nBut taking it even further:\n\n&gt;The number of murder victims fluctuated slightly from 1993 to 2007, whereas manslaughter remained relatively stable.\n\n&gt;The number of murder victims peaked in 1999, at 344; the number of manslaughter victims peaked in 2002, at 48.\n\n&gt;**The 253 murder and 29 manslaughter victims recorded in 2007 were the lowest annual number yet recorded.**\n\nhttp://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.aspx\n\nThey have even less murders now! Who'd have thought?\n\nJust to really rub it in:\n\n&gt;1. Where there are more guns there is more homicide (literature review).\n\n&gt;Our review of the academic literature found that a broad array of evidence indicates that gun availability is a risk factor for homicide, both in the United States and across high-income countries.  Case-control studies, ecological time-series and cross-sectional studies indicate that in homes, cities, states and regions in the US, **where there are more guns, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide.**\n\n..\n\n&gt;Using survey data on rates of household gun ownership, we examined the association between gun availability and homicide across states, 2001-2003. We found that states with higher levels of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm homicide and overall homicide.  **This relationship held for both genders and all age groups, after accounting for rates of aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, urbanization, alcohol consumption, and resource deprivation (e.g., poverty). There was no association between gun prevalence and non-firearm homicide.**\n\nhttp://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html\n\nOh, I'm sorry, that last one came from Harvard rather than the NRA. It's probably liberal commie hippie bullshit, to you.\n\n&gt;Because defending the most fundamental aspect of human rights that have determined the distribution of power and recognition of other rights is such a crazy idea right?\n\nNo, because the idea that no one can have your gun unless they kill you first is utterly fucking insane. That government of yours doesn't give a shit if you are armed to the teeth. A Hellfire missile would deal to you, no problem. The only people who care if a nutjob like that has a gun are his neighbours. They're the ones most likely to be shot with it.\n\nYou won't be defending liberty or freedom.. or you would already be on the streets with your guns overthrowing the corporate elites that are fucking up your nation. But as I said only cowards think they *need* a gun for self defence.\n\nI constantly hear American gun owners talking about defending liberty with their guns. Never seen it though. Patriot Act or not.\n\n&gt;I guess he just wanted to be able to defend his life and freedoms, fuck him right?\n\nI've never seen Charlton Heston pull a gun out and defend anything - except in the movies. Even after Waco and Ruby Ridge, the only guy with balls enough to do something about it took the cowardly truck bomb route.\n\nAll these militia running around with their army jackets over their beer guts, preparing for the day they have to face their government haven't seen the videos of \"Shock and Awe\". Or maybe they have. Maybe that's why the talk and talk and talk about defending freedom, but meekly comply whenever the government actually comes knocking.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry, is it some sort of collective choice?\n\nYes. Sane countries don't allow people to walk around with handguns for the same reason they don't let drunks drive.\n\n&gt;Does the local theives guild send you a letter telling you that you will be mugged sometime between 9am and 4pm three business days from now.\n\nOf course not. Does having a gun help? Nope. In fact, you are more likely to kill yourself with that gun than someone else. There are more gun-involved suicides in the US than gun-involved homicides.\n\nHowever, if you're murdered in the US, you are more likely to have been shot than stabbed, beaten, choked, or any of the other ways to commit murder, *combined*. Guns make murder easy. That's why you have so much of it.\n\n&gt;It is a personal choice the same way carrying a pocket knife, buying fire insurance or wearing a seatbelt is a personal choice.\n\nNot in a sane country, it isn't. I don't even trust half the people around me to use a car safely. Why the fuck would I want them carrying guns as well? That's just fucking nuts.\n\n&gt;Ownership of any of these things does not place other people around you at risk\n\nThe science disagrees.\n\n&gt;unless you believe guns can magically lift themselves out of holsters, aim and fire themselves.\n\nNo, guns don't kill people - the fucking morons that own them, kill people.\n\nMorons like this guy:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-rGnMKszxg\n\nor this guy:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtkapY3ZfD4\n\nor even this guy:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPteJHPWyt0\n\nShall I continue?\n\n&gt;lolno your laws are pointless just like every other prohibitionist law that doesn't rely on special/hard to manufacture ingredients. You have a lower crime rate because the majority of your population is western-European white, educated, and reasonably well paid.\n\nYou know nothing about Australia, do you?\n\nIn any case, let's look a little closer:\n\n&gt;In recent weeks there have been multiple shootings in Sydney blamed on the gangs.\n\n&gt;Homes have been sprayed with gunshots while children have slept inside, and there have been several related shootings in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland.\n\nNo one has died.\n\nBut back before the gun control laws when semi-automatic high-powered assault rifles were allowed:\n\n&gt;Clive Small charts the tensions back to the infamous Milperra massacre in 1984, when six bikers were shot dead in a pub car park in Sydney, while a teenage girl was killed in the crossfire.\n\nIt's a lot harder to kill six bikers when all you have is a bolt action rifle without a magazine.\n\n&gt;So I'm putting everyone at risk because other people are allowed to carry lumps of metal on their waistbands at their own discretion\n\nNo, you're putting everyone at risk because one day you might flip out and shoot someone before you can regain your senses, or you might mistake a kid with Skittles for an evil assailant and kill him in \"self-defence\" or you might accidentally shoot yourself or a bystander by dropping your gun. Or a real criminal might break into your home and steal it. You might even be one of the morons in the video above.\n\nWithout some form of gun control, how could I know you aren't one of *those* morons?\n\n&gt;but there is apparently no increased risk to myself.\n\nActually, as I said, you're more likely to shoot yourself with that gun than anyone else. One day after a particular shitty string of setbacks, you might decide this world is not for you, and punch your own ticket. In fact its about 20% more likely than you ever using it to defend yourself. So yeah, the risk is to you as well. Of course, if you're one of the guys in those videos, no one is safe, not you, not your kids, not your neighbours... no one.\n\n&gt;Can't have it that way you cheeky cunt, either there is a significant risk from everyone carrying guns which puts me at risk as well\n\nWell yes, of course. *You* might not be one of *those* morons... but the guy beside you at the range might be.

{"body": "I agree with you to an extent and I have definitely experienced specifically this from Nigerian taxi drivers, in particular the taking the long way round to get somewhere is something that really annoys me, hence, I always try to give directions wherever possible. Took a taxi once from East Wall to Pimlico, and the guy went via grand canal dock, pearse street, and then down onto the quays. I was furious.\n\nI would say that I would have a preference for an experienced local. That's not a race thing, it's more the old timers know all the backstreets and can get you through the traffic to your destination in half the time through alleyways you didn't even know were there.\n\nI'd never avoid a taxi with a black driver either, though I do go into it with an awareness of the experiences I've had before. I'll balance my above story with this. \n\nI once took a taxi with a Nigerian driver. He turned on the radio, and it defaulted to some kind of Irish trad music. I couldn't help it, I laughed. He laughed, I said \"You really like this kind of music?\" he said \"Naw man, I like the funk music!\", \"put some on then\" I replied ( he had his phone hooked up to the aux). He stuck on parliament while we were at the lights.\n\nThen he told me about his previous jobs, how he'd worked for IBM and moonlighted driving taxis until he was so tired he fell asleep at the lights once on his way to work. A Garda pulled up and knocked on the window. When he jumped awake, the Garda got a fright, and the man asked \"Why were you so shocked when I woke up?\"\n\n\"I thought you were dead\" replied the Garda, \"You looked so pale!\"\n\nThe man burst out laughing\n\"What you mean I look pale?!\"\n\"When I sick, I black, when I asleep, I black, WHEN I DEAD, I STILL FOOKIN BLACK!\"\n\nBest taxi ride ever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351112238", "subreddit": "ireland", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sophomore year, I went to a homecoming after party at a friends. Party started out fine with a few beers going around all casual like, until my friend goes into his room and retrieves a few handles of vodka and an ounce of weed. So here I am, huffin and puffin, gettin all happy until my friend puts me up for shots against some girl who I didn't know. I made it up to 9 double shots and she does 7. At this point I'm pretty drunk, and I'm declared the shots champion. I'm carried out the room and around the house as a bunch of drunk n high people chant my name. When I'm finally put down on the couch, that same girl I was drinking with jumps on me mumbling something in my ear. We start fondling and next thing I know, we're making out. After we finished, I grabbed us some beers and a what was left of a handle and we stumble downstairs to the basement and make an attempt to have something intimate going on. We start up again and finish our drinks and that bottle. I'm not really sure what happened from there, but I woke up in my friend's basement walk in closet, not knowing where I was. First thing was, of course, vomit my guts up. Second thing, I saw the girl that I met last night lying next to me, naked and with a spatula by her ass. It took me a while to recollect my thoughts and realize where I was and that I was wearing nothing but my wife beater. It was kind of cold down there, so I threw a jacket that was hanging on the girl, found my clothes, and left. \n\nI saw the girl at school on that Monday and she looked embarassed as shit when we made eye contact.\n\nTL;DR - party, twisted, girl, I don't remember", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351656368", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
