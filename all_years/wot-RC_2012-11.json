{"body": "Uhh... nobody said you had to listen to stuff in vorbis.\n\nI was sincerely considering paypaling you some cash to get a cheap mp3 and some decent cans to block out sounds, but the further I read on your post here, the less I wanted to help you.\n\nThat was an incredibly stuck-up reply, and is in no way the right attitude you should have, you sound like an elitist prick.\n\n\"Hey, you should try listening to music in public since you *might* have a disorder that causes you discomfort when you pay attention to your surroundings\"\n\n\"Oh, I would, but there is not enough money in the world to pay for my lavish tastes, despite the master CD tracks that my .ogg files would be ripped from having only 44khz sampling rate\"\n\nSeriously dude, if this was in any forum other than anxiety or depression, I'd be calling you a stuck up cunt right about now.\n\nHonestly, the more I read your post history, the more you seem like you just want some attention, and someone to talk to. But you're going about it the wrong way, especially with your facebook posting. You're just garnering negative attention to help influence your opinion on yourself. I mean... you're so sure you have depression and anxiety disorders and all that, to the point that you want to sprint into the doctors and get meds to \"feel better\" but, that's not how it is in my experience.\n\nI was at the doctors repeatedly for physical problems. Unable to get out of bed, constantly fatigued, upset stomach all the time. So much denial with the fact that I was depressed. \n\n\"I've got nothing to be depressed about, sure, I have problems, but it's no big deal\" \"No, I just get nauseated sometimes, I mean... anxiety can make you physically ill like that?\" \"So you think these pills will make me better?\"\n\nSpoilers: they didn't.\n\nBut making excuses not to try out non-medicinal ways to help yourself, and parading around making a scene \"OH YEAH, WELL I'LL PUT YOU IN MY SUICIDE NOTE, HOW WILL THAT MAKE YOU FEEL THEN?\" and all that shit, it's counter-productive, gives people a negative look on you, and causes more problems than it cures.\n\nI mean, I've been bullied all of my life. Verbally, physically, mentally... I've grown up in a decent family who all hates each other and yells constantly, I've had setbacks, personal loss, and stress as long as I can remember. A high IQ and the pressure to do well without the motivation to get out of bed. I was born to fail, and did so almost gracefully, but it took a lot of denial and convincing on my part just to understand and know that I wasn't 'normal.' That not everyone got a racing heartbeat taking an order in a restaurant, or that they don't get butterflies in their stomach waiting on the school bus, or standing up to hand in a test, or paranoia and anxiety every time they go to their locker, in case they forget which one is theirs, or their combination. Nausea every time you go to school, anxiety headaches so frequent that an eyesight test has to be done to rule out bad vision.\n\nI'm not saying you don't have some form of anxiety, or some state of being depressed, because I don't know that. Nor do you. You said yourself you wished you had a real reason to be sad, in relation to a story you read about how you \"wished it was you\" that had a horrific event happen to them, and I think this might be your way of experiencing that. Clearly you're upset, and feel like you don't belong, which is just typical teenager stuff, we've all been there. I think this could very easily be just another excuse though, similar to how you can't go down to a damn thrift store and pick up a walkman for $1 to help lessen your anxiety because you \"can't afford an .ogg player,\" it's like you don't want to be helped, because you've worked so hard to convince yourself that this is who you are, and how your life is. You WANT to have depression, and anxiety, because it's an excuse to why you don't fit in. It's \"oh, well, I'd be normal if not for these darn disorders\" but that's not always how it is. Every single person has a point in their life where they don't fit in anywhere, and everyone deals with it differently. Bullies can certainly make this worse, too. Both the actual symptoms of these disorders, and the reinforcement you give yourself to believe you do have them. Is it really so hard to believe that these people are treating you like you're a cheeky cunt because you actually might be a cheeky cunt?\n\nSo, I know I'll be downvoted to oblivion for this and potentially banned, but while I can accept you have anxiety problems and problems with being depressed, I don't actually think you have a disorder for either, because I don't think either are actually clinical problems for you.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed \"self-proclaimed professional internet doctor\" and self-proclaimed \"self-proclaimed cheeky cunt identifier\" I think you're just a cheeky cunt that needs a dose of reality and maybe less fortified drama in your diet.\n\nIf you really want to do something, then stand up to your bullies. Don't transfer the pain and drama over to someone else, or anything like that, and don't overreact and start shooting up a school or some shit, just give them equal doses of bullying right back when they bully you. Call them out on it, tell them you don't appreciate how they're treating you (Openly, not through the internet) and if it gets physical, then get physical right back. I have a permanent scar on the back of my hand from a 3rd degree burn I got in highschool from a bully. I'm 23, and I look at it every single day and regret not beating him to a pulp when he did it. I just sat there, and took it, and he threatened me and told me I'd regret it if I reported him, so I didn't even report it. I let him walk all over me, and because of that, and years of other bullies doing the same thing, I can be an asshole to people because I won't let anyone so much as step in my direction after being walked over so many times. I got nicknames for it. I get stares... at first I didn't even think it was that noticeable, but it's been 8 years and I don't go a month without someone seeing it and saying \"oh my god, what happened to your hand\" I play it off as a joke and tell them that \"the rules are, I'm not supposed to talk about it\" because it looks like the fight club lip scar, but it bothers me every single time. All because I let him change what I am. \n\nDon't let people change who you are.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351794943", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My personal view is that the relationship between metroids and Phazon is just a coincidence. Coincedence in that they both interact with the misterious \"life energy\": Metroids feed on it, Phazon probably overcharges you with it, causing mutations and stuff.\n\nWikitroid says the Metroids were genetically created by the Chozo (good fooking job) to combat a \"more dangerous\" parasite X. Probably Fusion lore then, haven't played that.\n\nSo, I say that Prime was originally one of the first Metroid prototypes. He was probably on a Chozo spaceship/station, where the experiments were being carried. Little fucker probably broke out, and just like Alien, ended up blast-doored into spaaaaaaaaaace.\n\nThere, while still alive, happened to met with a Leviathan, one of the seeds that Phaaze sends to spaaaaaaace in order to infest more planets with Phazon, creating more sentient planets like him.\n\nThere he must have regained enery with the life radiation emmited by the Phazon the Leviathan was carrying. Those things are probably sentient to some extent (they have heads in Prime 3), so the Leviathan showed interest in him feeding on what was his weapon. So they became friends, for it was to be a loooooooooooooooooooooong journey.\n\nThat's probably the point where Prime developed some sort of consciousness and intelligence, as well as the crazy mutation. And after gaining them, he probably got some information from the Leviathan, such as an invitation to come to Phaaze whenever he could, as well as probably the coordinates of the destination to another childhood friend Leviathan: Ether (thus explaining why Dark Samus went to Ether first instead of Phaaze).\n\nAfter a great amount of time, the lovely pair reached their destination:the Tallon system, fourth planet closest to the star. The dynamic duo crashed into the planet like a radioactive spermatozoid would... yeah. The Leviathan eventually perished after spreading enough Phazon to ensure it would continue on its own, and Prime... well he kept feeding on Phazon exclusively.\n\nThis means that Prime and the resto of Metroids present in Tallon IV have vastly different origins, and they being in the same planet is as much chance as it is the fact that they both were there due to the Leviathan (Prime was carried, the rest of metroids were brought by the pirates who came there attracted by the Phazon).\n\nThen Metroid Prime (the game) happens.\n\nPrime now has a more comfortable form to man spaceships. Since his main source of Phazon in Tallon IV is now gone, he probably takes a small pirate spaceship from there (there MUST be some, come on, and the reason you can't find it in Echoes is because, well, Prime had never piloted a ship before) and flyes to where he was told another Leviathan crashed: Ether. The lack o\n\nOnly things were a bit more complicated on Aether (sorry If I call it Ether, it comes more natural from Spanish): Either (hehe) it crashed a tiny bit too fast, or (more probably) the impact affected the wierd planetary energy the Luminoth used and... well, intead of fecunding Ether, the Leviathan created a rift in space-time or some wierd shit, and Dark Ether happened. Good job, Leviathan! The Phazon presence in Dark Ether can be explained by the Leviathan influence to some extent, although Dark Metroids' (my favourite kind of metroids: SIX CLAWS MAN) scan mentions the ing \"Being impressed with Metroids' interaction with Phazon\". That COULD imply that the Ing already knew about Phazon, but oh well, who could hate the Ing? Ing are awesome.\n\nSo yeah, it could very well be chance too that Samus finds Prime in Ether.\n\nThen Echoes happened. Through the course of the game, Prime was thought by the very Ing Emperor how to feel the Phazon, to BE THE PHAZON MY FRIEND and overcome the Phazon's Suit resistance towards Phazon radiation (on which Prime feed), and combined with Dark Ether's Best Of All Videogames History In: Dangerous Athmosphere, made him mutate even more (trivia: in Spanish, Emperor Ing's third form isn't called \"Mutated Emperor\", but \"Supermutated Emperor\", because Phazon).\n\nSo, if Prime's essence merged a bit with that of Dark Ether's athmosphere, he was probably carrying the will of all of the Ing with him.\n\nSo his next destination was Phaaze, he wanted to be introduce himself to that planet. He grabbed some fellow metroids on the way, which could explain their presence on Phaaze. Then Prime decided to help Phaaze into making the universe more \"phazonable\", converted the Pirates because he needed some technology and they were the only ones to have showed any interest in Phazon (which probably made Phaaze glad), and Prime 3 happened.\n\nAnd then we're left with the teaser of the ship from that Hunters' green lady, who... I don't know... seems to have a grudge with the Fed or with Samus. Maybe she was in love with a rogue Space Pirate, who was killed by Samus? Hell if I know.\n\n\nTL;DR: Prime was Alien, Prime and a Leviathan were space friends, Prime  stole  a spaceship to visit an aquintance of his space friend, Prime mutated through the ancient arts of toxic airbending, Prime brings his family to Phaze.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352072560", "subreddit": "Metroid", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I spent about 2 months in Australia, mostly Gold Coast. The blatant racism in Australia is pretty shocking, and one of the silliest things is that it usually gets swept under the rug by the media in most circumstances. Australia is relatively new to multi-culturalism, and because of this racism is tolerated, even in polite society. \n\nI remember an Australian at a bar thinking I was a \"Leb\" because I had extremely tan skin and a beard. I could feel the negative vibes right when we got in the bar. Eventually he started yelling shit from across the bar. He threatened to hit me with a bottle if I didn't leave, and nobody did anything about it. The bartender didn't make a peep. Everyone just stared at me, seeing what I'd do as he yelled \"I'll fookin glass ya, ya cunt!\". The people I was with basically pulled me outside and we left. If I didn't leave there's a chance I wouldn't be alive today. The guy and the group he was with had fucking murder in their eyes. It was pretty frightening.\n\nBut I also met some awesome Australians. However, I have no problem claiming confidently that Australia is the most blatantly racist country in the western world. \n\nThe hilarious thing was that the friend of my host who was really anti-American and told me how racist all Americans are, as part of his long list of shit he was telling me that was wrong with my country. Then, literally minutes later he explained to me that \"Abbos are terrible people\". The hypocrisy didn't register in his mind at all. Apparently he thought racism against Aboriginals is justified. I think Australians avoid dealing with their racism because they're constantly pointing their finger at the US to divert attention from their own faults. Australian media is very US-centric, they have this big foreign bogeyman to focus on all the time so they can avoid self-criticism as a nation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353400379", "subreddit": "videos", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I went through a BUNCH of LED listings on AliExpress, looking for items that offered a lot of wattage per dollar. Was planning to do something like pick up a pack of 5 for $450 and split them out here and on ebay, but [I lucked out and found EXACTLY what I was looking for](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Retangle-48W-CREE-LED-truck-work-Light-Flood-beam-Driving-lamp-waterproof/530310318.html), and it is not bundled into any package where you need to buy 4,5 or 10 units (though you do save on shipping if you order multiples).\n\nIt also looks the best suited for motorcycle use to me of any LED fog / work / truck lights I've seen, but I'm not 100% sure on normal headlight specs. If anybody has any advice there, I'd love to know what they think of this unit as a motorcycle headlamp (and not just \"day and early evening popo placator\" - I mean an honest-to-god blast-through-back-roads-at-night, LET ME SEE THE ROAD FOR HALF A MILE light). A \"let there be light\" light, if you will.  \n\nHere's the features I like:\n\n* UPS Delivered to door cost is $151.82 for two units. That's one of the cheapest per watt led setups I've seen.\n\n* 48 watts total power PER UNIT. For LED's that's a LOT of light. It doesn't have a lumen rating, but similar 40 watt units claim 3500 lumens, which is on par with the brightest HID car lamps. So its fooking BRIGHT. \n\n* Option for 60 or 30 degree spot. That's a bit wider than similar units, which is good (its more like a normal headlight). I figure to run one at 60 (low beam) and kick on the second at 30 degrees for a high beam. I might also modify the \"low\" unit with a switch that cuts it down to running only the center 4 lights, or the center 8, for daytime / parking lot use.\n\n* Case design makes it easy to chuck the stock mounting hardware and bodge up something much better. Most such units use a similar sistem, but some have systems that would be harder to adapt (eg, a threaded hole in the body).\n\nIf anybody wants to buy one or two, or review the specs in the original mangled Engrish, here's the link:\n\nhttp://www.aliexpress.com/item/Retangle-48W-CREE-LED-truck-work-Light-Flood-beam-Driving-lamp-waterproof/530310318.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353706257", "subreddit": "motorcycles", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
