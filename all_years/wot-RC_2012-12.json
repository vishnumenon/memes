{"body": "I find myself in the woods. I hear a roar of a mighty grizzly bear. I know I have two options: fight or flight. I decide this is a good time to die as any so I square up. This bear is huge and as nasty as t-rex on her period in the heat of July. I quickly spring into action and slam this monster with a left uppercut, just so it knows I'm not messing around. The griz swipes at me but they call anderson silva in the streets and duck and weave. The bear is relentless and i quickly tire of his games and do a round house kick to that bitch, as im in the air, i contemplate every moment of my badass life and let out uproarious laughter. I proceed to land on the back of the bear and grab it's neck and whisper into his ear \"it's been revoked\" and snap his neck. \nThen suddenly a wild shark appears. I quickly realize I'm in a animal kingdom battle royale. I rip off the bears hands to use as clawed boxing mitts, and i accept the great white beasts challenge. We met on his turf, the murky depths. I take a deep breath and meet him in Posesidans octagon. The bell rings and he can smell the fresh bear blood from my most recent kill. The great wimp lunges towards me as i took my mighty bear paw and jab it into his gill slits and rip all that shit out and eat it to gain his strength. This shark doesn't want to be made bitch in front of his family and friends so he keeps trucking. This is where it gets fun. Sharky goes for a bite but I grab his jaws and hold em open like Steve Irwin taught me. I start punching out all his baby teeth and make a necklace while he and his family watch in horror. The arena fills with blood and im starting to run out of air so i decide ill take this fight seriously. I cock back my mightily massive bear arm of Zeus and rock this fish dead on the nose. The force of this nuclear bomb punch makes a crater that makes marinanas trench look like a shallow grave. i swim to the surface to finally catch my breath. \nI finally thought i had time to revel my glories of the past 15 minutes when suddenly a mo'fookin bald eagle swoops down and scoops me up. \nIt's round 3 and this bird is cooked. She drops me in her nest and the eggs are hatching. Looks like im breakfast. Hahah. It's a 4 on 1 no biggie, 3 of them are just babies and the other is bald. Ill be making the early bird special at Francescos after all. She strikes suddenly. Catching me off guard and nicks my leg with her big ugly barbara striesand beak. She's tasted my blood so i need to return the favor. Leg sweep that hoe into a elbow drop off the top turnbuckle. Macho man would be proud. I lick the blood off her beak but before i get a catch to enjoy it the hatchlings kamikaze. I grab the biggest piece of shell and wing it at them, slicing them all in half right in front of dear all bald mom. She lets out a deafening screech that could be heard through the heavens. It's time to stuff this bird. She shoots up into the sky. So high i lose her in the sun. She's gon divebomb. I grab my trusty American flag with golden stand, and wait to make my move. The flying monster is descending at the speed of light, too bad for her I got reflexes like a cat and the early cat gets the bird or some shit like that.  I lock in on my target, that dirty birds heart. I already broke it so I might as well finish what i started. I throw my javelin American flag into the balding bitches rib cage. The flag goes in and out of that ungodly heathen of a bird. When the thanksgiving dinner lands, the American is soaring in triumph through it's back. \nNow that I conquered land, air and sea in a matter of 20 minutes, i decided it was time to enjoy a smoke. I light up 20 packs at once and savor the cool menthol taste of a newport. I flick my bogey and continue my walk to an early dinner with my parents. I notice a strange smell in the air and catch something in the corner of my eye and whisper \"manbearpig\".....\n\n\nTL/DR? your missing out", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354445109", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

To preface it with can you make it to the bottom, like it's a test that if you lose you stop trying, is also a no no. Best thing to do is to lay back all manly like and encourage the person. When she comes up for air, smile back at her, that's at least a turn for me. Talk some dirty talk and caress her head really gently. Slow, heavy breathing on your part helps. The gradual horniness of it all actually makes me want to impale my throat and reach his pubes all by own accord. Remember to let out a moan when she makes a touchdown. Makes her motivated to reach the base each and every time to get that reaction from you. You have to be her deepthroat cheerleader. These sessions should be viewed more as 'deepthroat practice sessions' or 'deepthroat training.' There are the deepthroat trainees, and then there are the supportive coaches who encourage the trainees every step of the way until she reaches her goal. Reaching the base is not as important as getting better and better at it each time you do it. The better the athlete becums, the happier and harder the coach gets.

{"body": "Position is important, sometimes it fits better whether you be sitting down, lying down, standing up, depends on each person. If she isn't capable of reaching your full length, there are solutions for this. I'm not a fan of head ramming, but actually when my throat is well-stretched and I want to give the guy that real good dick workout, I ask him to fuck my face with the back of my head trapped against the wall. You see, with head ramming, the onus is on the person to somehow themselves largen their own throat so you can get deeper. With slow face fooking against the wall, it is up to the MAN to gently push himself in. And usually if she can only reach an inch from bottom, the extra nudge you give her WILL close up that inch gap. The deepthroater doesn't have to exert themselves or spend any energy in fact, all she has to do is relax her throat muscles, and let your dick do the work.\n\nThere have been times when guys have done this to me, and have totally brought me to black out bliss, and it was fooking awesome! Him really going that deep and the fact the only thing I can see are his pubes galore, and the man smell of his pubes and body, allows me to really escape myself, close my eyes, and let his DICK take my mouth really to another place. Plus I can give my neck muscles a break, LOL!  It's important to pull out when she can't take it though, but in your excitement, you might not back-up off her so easily. The signal I use when he is starting to get rape like that is to tap the guy's hip 'it's enough' ... but you don't get me wrong, KEEP IT THERE, until she taps the second time, and THEN pull out.

{"body": "I'm sorry, but some of these answers are overcomplicated and artificial. Get yourself hard, then put a cock ring on that thing, even a rubber band will do! You can use a rubber or steel cock ring, steel probably for you 'cause your hung. Or you can use STRING to tie that bad boy and lock in the pressure for good.\n\nYou can also use LUBE! When you've done the power fucking and your starting to get a little tired, you then need to lay back and take it slow. Your girlfriend can stroke you gently with some liquid warmth while you catch your breath and work your way back up to a massive hard on. She kissing your nipples while she does this helps. Like your balls licked, she does it then! The point is to relax, take a break and allow your penis to slowly fill up again, and not by the sensation of fooking, but the sensation of touch.\n\nAnd people who watch porn should know this! Shame on them for not saying so. You need to alternate between ass, pussy, mouth, handjob and breast pumping, and in fairly often intervals to keep things fresh and going, and to keep that penis whipped up and hot! It is the change in the sensation of the penis that keeps a penis hard. A penis cannot stay hard forever by the same repeated movements and stimulations.\n\nIt's like Aaliyah's song, rock the boat, rock the boat, change positions, change positions.\n\nAnd finally, you need to find what what makes you tick. Whether it be fooking your girl a second time around with cum on her face as she stares back at you exhilarated, and you seriously didn't expecting you had it in you to get hard AGAIN. Or being fucked silly by your girl ridin on top of ya while being handcuffed and blindfolded and high as a kite.\n\nFind out what makes you tick, and when you have an urge, act on it fast, like telling your girl, I'm really hard right now, and I have to cum inside you, NOW, or it won't last. Don't worry, you'll go from semi hard to cumming in at matter of seconds, pull it out real fast, and I am sure it will be twitching and bouncing right infront of your eyes, as the last bits of your cum splat her pussy.\n\nEverytime your girlfriend or you gets you hard, take a photo of it. Have her pose beside your dick in various shots as proof you were hard and she was there to see as witness. Have her make a photo album of your cock, and put it on her or your screensaver. Every time you open your computer, there will be proof right there you can get hard. The reminder of certain sexual states of being once achieved before, and the knowledge you have the control to get there again, is VERY STIMULATING.\n\nYou need to be more in love with yourself and your body. You said your skinny as hell. What about sexy as hell! Take some nude pics, get your cock commented and praised on reddit, make videos of yourself jacking off and watch them as you jack off again, and look at yourself in the mirror as you beat off, really focusing on the motions of your hands and how your cock has responded. You will realize how sexy and beautiful you look when you are hard, and how appreciative your little monkey is when you get him as glorious as you know he can be.\n\nLast resort. Get a fleshlight, and edge the fook out of yourself for hours. Or even a vibrator, the ones that put electrical shock into your dick.\n\nAnd I have never NOT been horny in the morning after a full night of wet dreams. It's in the morning, that's when your girlfriend should surprise ride and deepthroat you, and she should do so when your not fully awake, because that is when you are not conscious of your hard on, but you definitely have one!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354760710", "subreddit": "bigdickproblems", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

As in, the fucker is so big it actually looks as if my ass is smiling at you, except it's that kind of crooked smile that makes you want to kick whoever's doing it right in the nads.\n\nI got it one night in July 2010.  Me and my friends were out in the Falls, and several drinks in we were as usual becoming increasingly patriotic.  At some point, someone announced grimly that the people in the neighbouring Village area had hung UVF flags up on lampposts facing the Falls.\n\n(Non-Irish-Redditors - the UVF are a paramilitary organisation whose main aim was to kill as many Catholic civilians as possible in order to scare them into backing down.  It's kind of hard to explain to people who don't know about it, but something like this is kind of like the KKK hiring a billboard in the South Bronx.)\n\nThis was clearly an outrage, so me and my friends set forth to make it right.  I'm not sure exactly what we were planning to do with the flag once we had it, because to be honest I don't think we'd thought any further than \"let's go get that fookin' flag, so\") but nonetheless, we were determined in our quest, and soon arrived at the lampposts in question.\n\nMy friends being the assfucks they are, they immediately decided I should be the one to shimmy up the lamppost to grab the flag, on the grounds that I was the only one with any hope of getting anywhere.  I had to admit they had a point, so up I went, and once I'm a good 16ft up and reaching for the flag... some Village youths turn up.  With airguns.\n\nThe first I know of this is when my friends start yelling, and I'm just starting to turn around when I feel a searing pain in the back of my leg.  Yes, the fuckers had actually shot me in the leg.  I grabbed for the flag, tearing it off the lamppost as I fell backwards off it and landed flat on my ass - and, not only did I fall on my ass, I fell on my ass so hard I SPLIT MY ASS OPEN (hence the scar.)  Me being me, I think this is the funniest thing ever, so while a couple of my friends are hauling ass after the Village hoodlums, I am sat on the ground laughing my ass off and yelling \"JESUS BUT I THINK I BROKE MY ASS!\" over and over. \n\nIt took my friends a surprisingly long time to get me to shut the fuck up for long enough to finally head for home, flag in hand.\n\nTL;DR: Shot in the leg, fell off a lamppost, and now my ass smiles at you crooked.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356549486", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
