Suddenly, Gordge put his whole mouth over MrTwiggy's claymore and began to bob his head up and down while tounging MrTwiggy's tip! The hot drunken whisky-laced breath on his phallus felt like heaven. Then, it felt different. 'OH FUR FUCK'S SAKE WOT IS DIS LAD DOOIN?' MrTwiggy thought. Suddenly, it struck him! Gordge was now sucking on his entire erect claymore!  \n\n\"BLIMEY!\" MrTwiggy shouted. Suddenly, a boiling feeling swelled up in his lions and surged throughout his whole body. \"FREEEEEEDOMMMMMMMM!\" MrTwiggy cried as he hit climax and came into Gordge's mouth. Gordge began sucking up the salty, slightly bitter nectar from MrTwiggy's spent claymore. \"THAT IS A PROPER BEVVY, CUNT, BUT AM NO NANCY BOY.\" Gordge said while trying to catch his breath. He then turned around and bent over. \"A'RITE, LADDIE, YE PROMISED DIS WOULDN'HERT, I HOPE YER NOT TALKIN' OOT YER FANNY FLAPS, OTHERWISE FUCK OFF, YE WEE MINGER.\"  \n\n\"IT MIGHT HERT A WEE BIT AT FIRST, YE FUCKIN' GOON, BUT DEAL WIDDIT, AITE?\" warned MrTwiggy as he slid his lubricated cock into Gordge's hairy anus. \"CHRRISSTT!\" Gordge yelped as he was entered deeper. At first, it hurt a lot, but then the pain numbed and then it felt as if he were cumming from every thrust. But, he knew it was just an illusion. MrTwiggy then reached down and grabbed Gordge's broadsword and began polishing it.  \n\nThey were both exhausted. Gordge felt as if his arms were going to give in at any moment, but he desperately kept himself upright. Then, Gordge felt it! A boiling sensation running throughout his body! This was the best pleasure he had ever felt. Soon enough, he had hit climax. The contractions in his anus caused MrTwiggy to reach his, too. The feeling of coming together was pure bliss. The fun had ended. They both collapsed to the floor.  \n\n\"I FOOKIN' HATE YE, YE FUCKINN....MINFB... BHF.. EH\" Gordge mumbled before passing out. \"DINNAE SAY DAT, YA BOOT...

Why I am not exactly sure. I realize you disdain anything that is not MMA or Queen's Commerce, but there are actually those of us that are not into MMA or Queen's Commerce and we actually enjoy what we do. As a \"motivated and *professional* commerce student\" you might consider just letting us do our thing and you go do your thing and everyone is happy.\n\nYou clearly have limited knowledge and experience with karate. The form of karate you refer to in your original post certainly exists and I have experienced it myself. However, your willingness to tar all karate with the same brush is as ridiculous as arguing that all University commerce programs are identical, something I know you would most certainly disagree with. You clearly do not understand the difference between karate-do and karate-jutsu.\n\nOkinawan karate is an actual system of self defence. It was actually used by Okinawans for self-defence purposes so it is clearly not useless as a fighting system. The degree of contact in training varies by style, school, lineage, teacher and level of experience of the student. There are schools and styles that engage in more contact than we do, and those that engage in less contact than we do. As with degree of contact, the meaning of a black belt varies with style, school, lineage and teacher. In our school a black belt indicates, among other things, a student who has learned our entire curriculum, one might say 'has mastered the basics', and is now ready to begin serious study.\n\nIf you have anything useful to add to the conversation, I'd love to hear it.

{"body": "&gt; I'm hoping you'll realize, as you've admitted, that the problem isn't here or necessarily everywhere, but in specific areas.\n\nThose areas being pretty much every other online community that I visit. They ARE everywhere, it's impossible to avoid. I can hardly go anywhere without it being shoved into my face, unlike sonic, twilight or any other examples. Pokémon maybe, but again, that's a huge, mainstream franchise like Mario. And they are pushing it on me by making it impossible to get away from.\n\n\n&gt; MLP and bronies are a bit of a unique animal probably because it's so unexpected and they're excited.\n\nU wot m8\n\nYou can't dismiss all of the obnoxious people of your fandom as \"trolls\", all of the ones I've seen are completely serious and a bit thick. Wait, are you admitting here that the fandom is annoying? Or at least, does this help you understand why you're hated?\n\nThis may be because the only bronies I see are these \"obnoxious\" ones, seeing as I tend to stay away from MLP related stuff; but the ones I DO see are plenty in value (as I've said many times, it's difficult to escape them) and very annoying and pushy, and are nothing like any other fandom I know of, except maybe furries. But bronies have managed to overshadow those recently.\n\nBy inserting ponies into pretty much every videogame and franchise to exist, it's forcing their fandom on fans of said franchise, and makes it even harder to ignore. This is why whatever you search on the internet nowadays, ponies won't be far away. It also ruins the integrity of the franchise, especially if it's serious and adult, which prompts responses like \"Why do you ponyfags have to ruin everything?\" Which, if a little crudely worded, is still a good point. Although in my opinion, it's because bronies are attempting to make the idea of MLP seem less girly, but I digress.\n\nExtremely few in comparison maybe, but the number is still a lot higher than you make it out to be, I mean, it can't just be one or two \"ponyfags\" out there that have plastered the whole internet with it who are ruining everything for those poor oppressed bronies. Although the vast majority of Muslims aren't extremists, there are still thousands of Muslim terrorists out there that cause suffering and death, and it can't be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359055595", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So as a matter of discussion,  what makes lasertag more cringe-worthy than say fencing?  Or curling?  During the olympics, it was a really hard for me to follow the action because those they move at lightning speed!  Of course.. curling is fooking awesome because I hear it is played in bars... so it wins by default.\n\nFirst a disclaimer,  I have played lasertag for a long time.  I don't play public anymore (except with my kids),  I play maybe about 4-6 times a year a tournaments where there are people that are exceptional at lasertag.  lord, why would anyone admit that?  Because honestly I can't judge one physical skill as less/more admirable than another.  I have played many a 1 v 1 on different systems, I have played other sports for years, it just happens that I also pretty good at lasertag.  I play in LaserQuest North American Challenge (its in Vegas!  my team placed 2nd in this years nationals to those FOOKING canadians.. much respect Toronto East). There are 16 - 8 man teams that show up to this event from around the country.  I run a tournament that is sort of a marathon for lasertag called \"Armageddon\",  4 days, 56 games,  8 different systems, true nerddom. \n\nTake any sort of physical activity (no I am calling it a sport :)  ) that a group of people excel at and you get a strange sort of egotism surrounding it:\n1. You have those people that play it and say 'hey, this is fun!', \n2. You have those people that define their lives with it (with no social outlet save their hand, some peanut butter, a domesticated animal and pictures of Kaley Cuoco) which have come to define public view of lasertag, \n3. and you have those that realize they are pretty good at it and seek out other people that are good at it to challenge themselves.\nWhen I first started playing as a teen,  people would fall into 1 of these 3 categories.  \n\nI am pretty athletic, I played soccer since I was 5 (I am 40 now... I hated typing that :).. still loving indoor soccer),  I also do JuJitSu at fitness fight factory in Colleyville, TX (Hail to Johnny Bedford and Evan Cutts!  I am the slowest learning jujitsu student ever by the way).  In my humble opinion,  your body is designed to move, why not have it move with an activity that commands you to play?  I looked at people that played sports that I thought were silly like ping pong?  Badminton (sp)?  Curling?  Croquet? Shuffleboard? Bocce? Bowling?! And scoffed at these silly games because they looked like they required no skill.  Laughable sports.... until I did them.  Then I played against people that where much better than me.  My first reaction is to ridicule this activity as not worth my time.  But I have come to realize that those who excel in their sports have a spark of passion,  a desire to better themselves in their activity, a creative tendency to evolve in this activity, and a desire to dominate by proving themselves in this activity (respones, please be clever in your verb substition for the above word 'action').  \n\nYes, I cringed at those people,  mocked them for playing those above 'non-sports', but breaking it down as have, I have respect for those players, the drive, passion.  \n\nIf the video made you cringe, than you probably were not the intended audience.  Have fun poking fun at it!  \nBut bieng athletic, I promise you that the exaustion one feels comming out of a 1 v 1 duel is comparable with any sports that I have played. The reason why 1 v 1 players play so closely is so they can share testicular moisture.... wait.. no.. it is because you have to adjust your angle much wider when the sensors are 1 feet from you.  Think about it,  if you are 20 feet way,  basic trig will show you that your angle to aim for a different sensor will be much smaller.  But if your opponent was 1 foot away, you have to move your gun much more in order to find an open target.  As your opponent dodges this, they must try to find an open sensor.  This starts this 'siezure dance' that looks non-sensical.   However, if you slow it down, you will see that each movement is in direct response to where the opponent is moving thier gun.  these quick rapid movements all have a cascading effect.... what seems senseless actually is full of intention.  \n\nSo,  cringe away!  but I can't wait to face these gentlemen/ladies at Armageddon in June,  at LaerTron Nationals, UltraZone Nationals,  Darklight Nationals, LaserStorm Nationals,  LaserForce Nationals...  \n\nYou, the reader, have your passions,  and you will probably destroy me in this passion.  That's awesome, maybe you can teach me,  I am willing to learn :)\n\nPeace ya'll :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359086842", "subreddit": "cringe", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

An hour and a half in we were well on our way to being wasted. [This pic here](http://imgur.com/wCnQ7WI) shows me still in happy-drunk mode. The sign reads: Jrg86 - Happy fookin Straya Day.  2:41pm local time.\nIt started going downhill shortly thereafter. Every shot we did was to the tune of 'Aussie Aussie Aussie - Oi Oi Oi' which made for quite the spectacle in a bowling alley full of families and young kids. [Here's me a couple hours later](http://imgur.com/VzaR1Vm) with the same sign... I was definitely hammered at this point and flirting with getting kicked out of the bowling alley. Happy drunk was a distant memory...\nHiked down to the second bar not too long after the second pic there was taken... had to stop along the way to puke all over the sidewalk. Memories of what occurred at the second bar are spotty at best. Played some shuffleboard, broke a beer mug, pissed off some lesbians... generally made an ass of myself. Closed that bar down (2:00am closing time here locally) and by the grace of god managed to flag a cab right away and somehow made it home. \n\nAll in all it was a damn good day. Wished a \"Happy Fookin Straya Day\" to more people than I can remember.. and I will definitely be celebrating again next year. With a bit more foresight I\"ll be able to get my hands on a flag and some Bundys to celebrate right proper. \n\nIt's currently 10:58am here in Detroit and I'm still quite smashed. \n\n\nSide note: I'm currently in the process of opening up a bar/restaurant.. and if the deal goes through we are absolutely doing a Straya Day blowout next year.\n\nCheers!
