One of my friends found this thread for me. :p\n\nAnyway, I'd like to answer a few questions. Yes, you just drop it into the Interface/Addons folder, make sure you restart the game and enable out of date addons and it should work.\n\nIt is NOT compatible with other unit frame addons. It IS SCT. If you already have SCT just replace this addon with it and all the settings are carried over. If you have something else, you have to switch, as it were, to SCT.\n\nYou can change the \"nerfnumber\" from 30 to anything you like by opening the main LUA files of each addon. There is a variable called nerfnumber, and it is set to 30. sct/sct.lua, sctd/sctd.lua, SquishFrames/SquishFrames.lua all have the variable. None other do.\n\n3 will give you Cata-esque numbers, around 12 will give you WotLK esque numbers, around 30-35 will give you tBC esque numbers, and around 80 will give you vanilla esque numbers.\n\nI'd love it if someone can do better than this hack. :p This was mostly to seed the idea.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360330444", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

Or would you prefer something more indulgent, bland, sophisticated?\" If in that austere mode and manner, I shall have to call up someone from the dead, one of those old gentlemen bearded not with the modern style of fringe that so titillates her, but with one of those bristly bushes we see on antique statues and portrait-busts. And be will scold the woman and speak for me and keep her from getting angry with me as she might otherwise do. So let us call up some ancestor of hers, preferably old blind Appius Claudius himself. He will be the least likely to be grieved, since he won't have to look at her. Doubtless if he rose among us be would say something about like this: \"Woman, what business did you have with Caelius, a man scarce out of his teens, a man not your husband? Why were you so friendly with him as to lend him gold? Or how did you grow so unfriendly as to fear his poison? Did you never hear that your father, uncle, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, and great-great-great-grandfather were consuls? Did you forget that only recently you were the wife of Quintus Metellus, a gentleman of the highest type, a distinguished patriot who had only to show his face to eclipse almost all other citizens in character, reputation, dignity? Born of a high-ranking family, married into a prominent family, how did it happen that you admitted Caelius to such familiarity? Was he a relative or friend of your husband? Not at all. What was it then but hot and headstrong passion? If the portraits of us male ancestors meant nothing to you, how could my granddaughter, Quinta Claudia, have failed to inspire you to emulate her domestic virtue and womanly glory? Or that vestal virgin of our name who kept her arms around her father throughout his triumph and foiled the tribune's attempt to drag him from his chariot? Why choose to imitate your brother's vices in preference to the good qualities of your father and grandfather and of men and women of our line on back to myself? Did I break the agreement with King Pyrrhus that you might every day enter into disgusting agreements with your paramours? Did I bring in the Appian Aqueduct that you might put its waters to your dirty uses? Did I build the Appian Way that you might ride up and down with other women's husbands?\"\n\nCicero is just asking questions here, not accusations, just some simple questions you know (16):\n\n&gt;I am not saying anything against that woman now; but if there were someone -not the same as her, you understand-some woman who made herself cheap and easy to approach, who always bad some man or other banging about openly acknowledged as her current interest, in whose gardens and home and place at Baiae anybody and everybody could arrange assignations with her permission, who even boarded young men and made up deficiencies in their allowances out of her own purse, if this person, being widowed, lived loosely, being forward, lived wantonly, being rich, lived extravagantly, being prurient, lived like a harlot, am I to think a man an adulterer if he does not address her exactly like a lady?\n\nOne of his most brilliant ploys was to turn Caelius' reputation for wantonness against Clodia (20):\n\n&gt;\"But,\" you say, \"I get a whiff of something rotten when think about his moving to that neighborhood and when I remember the gossip about him. And don't those trips to Baiae hint at something?\" Not merely hint, they shout to heaven that a certain woman is so far gone in vice that, far from hunting for shadows and solitude to conceal her wantonness, she flaunts her outrageous conduct in broad day in the most frequented places.\n\nAnother clever rhetorical trick, in which he turns the accusation on the accuser, and puts in one of his better quips (21):\n\n&gt; But first I would like to know, did Caelius tell Clodia what he wanted the money for, or not? If not, why did she give it? If he told her, then she was an accessory before the fact. Tell me, Clodia, did you dare to hand over the gold from your safe, to despoil that Venus of yours of her ornaments, as she had despoiled so many others, knowing all the while what a crime he wanted it for, knowing that it would be used to murder a legate and stain forever the name of that god-fearing, upright man, Lucius Lucceius? Your spirit ought not to have been privy to such a design, your popular home should not have been accessory to it, not your hospitable Venus made a confederate. Balbus foresaw this danger. He declared that Clodia knew nothing, that Caelius had got her to listen by saying that he wanted the gold for some shows he intended to give. If Caelius was as intimate with Clodia as you wotild picture him when you rave about his viciousness, then surely he must have told her what he wanted with it. But if he was not that intimate, I say she gave him nothing. And so, my dear lady, though I know you hate restraint, I must present you with a rather narrow choice. Either Caelius told you all, in which case you knowingly gave the gold for a criminal purpose, or he did not dare tell, in which case you did not give it at all.\n\nAn idle hypothetical (26):\n\n&gt;Why did she settle on a public bathhouse? That hardly appears to me to afford a hiding-place for men in their togas. If they had stayed in the vestibule of the building, they would have been in plain sight. But if they wanted to go farther inside, they could not very comfortably have done so with their boots and clothes on, and would probably not have been admitted. (Though they might have been, of course, assuming that that lady of influence, a member of the bathkeeper's guild herself, in a manner of speaking, might have got them in by making a bargain with the bathman to exchange services in kind.)\n\nIt is worth it to read the entire speech, but I selected some of the funnier bits that show Cicero's fantastic use of *ad hominem*. Caelius was acquitted and Cicero further deepened his enmity with Clodius. Clodius would be killed a few years later in a brawl on the Appian Way. Caeslius died not long after when he unadvisedly raised opposition against Caesar. Caesar died, murdered in the Seante house by a confederation of Senators, and Cicero was killed on the orders of Mark Antony in the aftermath, Antony himself dying in conflict with Octavian, Caesar's heir.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360687968", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

He says that if I can get him home, he'll totally return and fix this whole thing. So I'm like \"I got nothin' to lose, let's do this\". So we get some badass alien weapons and start shootin' up the whole district. Missiles flying and shit, you had to be there, man. \n\nBut so then he escapes with his little fooker son, and they blast off. The guy said he'll be back in like 3 years.

{"body": "Decided to add a bit more to my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/18u1ch/what_do_pitt_students_think_of_thon/c8i0clp) below, explaining the cultural aspect of THON at Penn State.\n\n---\nA lot of people at Penn State don't necessarily *like* THON and a lot of us absolutely hate the cheerleaders who are associated with it. The most vocal group of THON volunteers are in Morale, and their job is to insure that the dancers stay awake and dedicated.   \n&gt;The mission of the Morale Committee is to provide physical and emotional support for the dancers THON Weekend. The Morale Committee ensures the safety and wellbeing of the dancers and also extends its assistance to the THON Community throughout the entire year.  \n\nThey are very loud. All the time. That's why you hear them so much. However, raising money searching for not only a cure to help pediatric cancer, but to help families who are having trouble paying for it, is fantastic. Even if you dislike the culture of THON, you can't really say much against it - it's effective, most people like it, it helps, and being negative towards it gets conflated with being a bad person.  \n\nMany people also get angry at the whole self-righteousness aspect of it. I'm with you guys. I think charity is great, but I think that it should be as anonymous as possible. Doing something good for recognition that you've done something good comes of as selfish to me, and many others in my experience. \n\nAs to a comment made by /u/fookingprawn - Pitt did not cure polio. There is no cure for polio. Ask the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation - they are currently searching for one. Jonas Salk helped catalog polio strains and develop a vaccine while at Pitt with funding from individual and institutional donors, including Pitt and the precursor to the March of Dimes.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361379027", "subreddit": "Pitt", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Scrappy Doo was dangled above, just staring at Sarah's tits and yelling \"LEMME AT 'EM LEMME AT 'EM LEMME AT 'EMMMM!!!\"  Rowan was immediately humbled by my size and Sarah forced everyone out of the room but me, but somehow Isla Fisher managed to sneak her way in on Vince Vaughan's back.  I took a quick peek out the door to make sure no one else was around, and all I saw was Rowan getting freaky with Sofia Vergara.  I didn't have time to wonder where the fuck she came from, because as soon as I turned around Woody fucking Harrelson starting attacking me and telling me to see Rampart.  I turned and ran, but since I wasn't really looking where I was going I ended up running straight into what felt like a brick wall.  When I stood up, I was greeted with the most evil Jack Nicholson grin you could imagine.  He started babbling some gibberish, so I just ended up walking away.\n\nSo anyway I eventually wised up and started to try and track down Sarah and Isla.  I got a few feet into the woods when Arnold Schwarzenegger calls me an ugly motherfucker and kicks me so far into the air that Richard Branson hits me with his plane.  He brings me inside using his Virgin Mobile magic and, after hearing how I ran out on Sarah and Isla, just stared at me and said \"u wot m8.\"  He then figured that I should be getting back to the ground soon, so he brought out Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp to break me up into light particles and send me back.  \n\nI finally got back down to ground level, where I was greeted by Will Smith when he said \"Welcome to Earth!\"  His son was there too, but he was too busy messing around with Ralph Macchio to notice me.  Matthew Broderick used his inspector skills to deduce that I was about 6 miles from where I began, and told me to ask Morgan Freeman for a ride back.  I told Mr. Freeman that I just wanted to go home after this crazy day, told him where I lived, and he took me.  So he and I made small talk for a while, and when I was about he get out he said he needed about $3.50 for cab fare.  I reached into my pocket to get it, and that's when I noticed that Morgan Freeman was a 50-foot tall Loch Ness Monster.\n\nHe was about to curb stomp me when out of nowhere a shadowy figure tackled me into safety.  He was wearing a mask, but he somehow seemed familiar.  Anyway, he took me out for ice cream and I told him how my day had been.  I asked him if I should go to the news with it, but he just replied with \"No one will believe you.\"\n\nFucking Bill Murray.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361612780", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
