{"body": "Personally, I've never played a monk but I've designed a few and seen a few played.\n\nMonks have real limitations in terms of stats. Want to use your monk powers? Need wisdom so you can avoid armor. Want to do damage? Need strength. Want to NOT DIE with your naturally lower armor class? Constitution. They are a lot of fun to play, especially with some of the alt features introduced across the splats but you need to be aware that you are essentially filling the role of a barbarian (sacrificing BAB for hits and speed) but with less health in exchange for some immunities and slow fall.\n\nThe tattooed monk itself I've always passed over. Don't get me wrong, it's neat. Some of the tattoos are really useful. However, some of the tattoos seem specifically designed to replace things you lost by giving up monk levels. You also need to spend a move action to activate each active-effect tattoo.\n\nLet's offend people and compare this to a barbarian again. You rage. You get some stat bonuses for as long as you're raging. Entering the rage was a free action. Tattooed Monk? You activate a tattoo. You are now stationary for the advantage of one stat bonus or effect. To put it another way, a wizard of the same level can get the same bonuses and effects from ***packing a bunch of quickened enhancement spells and a monk's belt***. Guess what else he can also do that day? the entire span of magic 4th or less.\n\nLastly, the entrance requirements are a buggerfuck way to say \"for monks\" in capital letters. 8 ranks of K(R)? Frankly, all your points are going into generally more useful things. You want a +3 to int all so you can have the skill points to qualify for a prc? Endurance and improved grapple for a class that gives no bonuses to grapple? Fuck you WotC. \n\nIf you like the flavor of the tattooed monk, talk to your dm. It's a really nice concept and most of the effects are rather spot on. Activating tattoos as a swift action is almost obviously necessary. Getting rid of endurance and improved grapple prereqs is another good fix (maybe say something else is a prereq). Giving the tattooed monk another five levels of the same is a good way to make it more playable, since it is obviously not a dip class. Alternatively, treat the entire class as substitution levels of monk. Loose a upgrade to your immunities or slow fall or something in exchange for gaining a tattoo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362295297", "subreddit": "DnD", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It was me and 3 of my\nFriends, we started Playing beer pong, I was actually pretty good for my first time. \n\nWe played like 5 games and I was drinking and drinking and drinking beers like a motherfucker, I was downing them like a whore on colfax. The only reason I drank so much was because I didn't know how much to drink, I thought alcohol took effect instantly. \n\nAfter about 9 beers total, including those beer pong games, I was pretty fucked up, I remember trying to play basketball with 2 friends and falling face first on the driveway and laughing.\n\nI had half of another beer while my friends played another round of pong. I felt like I was gonna puke so my friends got a bucket for me which I puked in profusely, then pulled up my head and started laughing.\n\nI went to go pour my puke from the bucket to the toilet and ended up blacking out. I woke to his dad at the bathroom door telling me to get out, which was weird because I had known Paul my whole life, literally, so his dad was like a second dad to me. \n\nWhen I was walking out I saw this GIGANTIC PYRAMID of empty beer cans that Paul was in\nThe process of carrying out, there were probably 22-24 cans. Paul's dad was like \"IS THAT MY FUCKING BEER!?\" And Paul said \"uhhh... No,no... It's ours\" \n\nHis dad had us leave, including Paul, so he could have time to think. As we walked away Paul's mom swerved around the corner, and with a thick British accent she screamed \"GET IN THE FOOKING CAR POOL, ALL OF YOUR PARENTS ARE GOONG TO HEAR ABOUT THIS...ESPECIALLY YOURS, DANNY!\" And as she drive off Danny was like\" ...the fuck did I do?\" It was hilarious.\n\nLuckily my parents were gone for the day, so I went home and fell asleep. Nothing really happened to\nPaul, his dad is cool, he was just shocked, he said he just prefers we don't drink until we're 18 and he understood why we did it because he was the same way at our age.\n\nTL;DR: I typed this in my phone, please fucking read it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363484345", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I agree with you on grama! I am fookin amazed at things I sometimes say. Also you are rightsafety is a BIG concern. When I called up a electronics parts house to buy stuff to make the go flow version they asked about amperage and I said it does not say anything about that. The guy said you want to trust your brain to a schematic that doesn't list everything? So I bought the Chatanooga device which does have fail safes and current regulation. I have thought of adding an inline fuse to the anode side of the exterior lead wires as one more layer of defense. Another thing you are right on!\n\nStickiness is not a concern for me. I use a sports headband although I lust for the expandable meash that you might have seen a young female member of the military wearing sitting in front of a computer. It is the same stuff you might have seen asian pears packed in. in fact the next time i see one of those pears i am going to call up the folks where they come from and ask them where they get it! Saline sponge electrodes work. I have no interest in reinventing the wheel. You go for it and if you come up with something better let me know! I will certainly take you seiously. Test it before letting me know. \n\nYep not many Drs know about tdcs. My shrink did but he used it in grad school decades and decades ago.\n\nHd electrodes are fascinating but I would have to really up my game on electrode placement.\n\nI use three montages. I was in a serious auto accident and tried the pain montage. IT works really well. Lasts about two days. So i do it every other day. Anode on motor cortex , cathode on my right shoulder. \n\ni use the typical depression arrangement. F3 for the anode and sub orbital right eye for cathode. Sports band works for this.\n\nI also use a montage where i put the anode just behind Werikes area with the cathode on my right shoulder. Due to spread I am fairly sure that Werikes get some juice too. I do not know why but it changes the stage upon which my thoughts play out a bit better. It is an area that supposedly deals with language.\n\nThanks for your great response! I hope that this helps.

{"body": "&gt;And they're based on percentiles. The chances of killing someone while hopping over them is almost nil. And you're playing strawlaw here, drunk driving is not hopping. You also slippery sloped to compare the two.\n\nI did not compare the laws at all. I pointed out the point of there existence. \n\nLet's ignore the death comment then. What about injuries? Broken bones, concussions or even cuts and bruises and the like. Are the chances of those \"next to nil\" with someone jumping over you? I rather doubt they are. I'd say they're pretty common actually if YouTube \"parkour fails\" are anything to go by. (the last reference was a joke, just in case you attempt to clutch at straws with your argument.)\n\n&gt;Yes, it has happened, read some history books. That's why we look to prevent it.\n\n...it typically happens in countries that are completely corrupt or in severe disarray. [Pre-Nazi Germany for example, was so poor that children played with stacks of money in the streets because of it's practically non-existent value.](http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/hyperinflation-1921-1923/)\n\nI have read history books, it appears you haven't though. Anyway, do you really believe maintaining a reckless endangerment law will lead to a Stalinist, fascist evil America controlled by the government? If you do, you may want to go back to school and demand your money back, because they fucked up with you, mate.\n\n&gt;Nope, they're not. If you harass me verbally, it's still harassment and could also be stalking if you continue to talk to me when I don't want you to. That's why I mentioned I'd give people more freedom than the law.\n\nIrrelevant to the original point. Reckless Endangerment is against the law and you are not allowed to do it as it is not protected in the USA constitution. By the way, most minor crimes go unreported. You are not the exception, you are the rule in this case. You are not some great freedom hero so please get over yourself. \n\n&gt;I never promoted to teach hopping over people.\n\nNo, you promoted leniancy towards stupid people injuring innocent people because of some weird life philosophy bullshit which in turn would allow people to do more stupid shit. I disagree with that because you should be allowed leave your home with the knowledge that being injured by a fucking idiot will be unlikely thanks to the law. \n\n&gt;No, he'd be charged appropriately if he hurt anyone. This rarely happens due to laws against bicycles where people dwell such as sidewalks\n\nExcept we're talking about reckless endangerment not accidents. An accident is when the bicycle guy is distracted momentarily and hits you. Reckless endangerment is when the bicycle guy puts on a blindfold and cycles whilst playing guitar and hits you. Do you understand the difference?\n\n&gt;And there's good reasonable laws for this preventive measure anyway.\n\nYes and one is called Reckless Endangerment. By the way, I love how you didn't actually list any laws. I'm sure debate club loved you. \n\n&gt;You're really grabbing straws to endorse a law against hopping over people. You're slippery sloping again towards comparing people on riding vehicles to pedestrian occurrences\n\nReckless endangerment applies to both. If you decided to drive with your feet or walk down the street swinging a chainsaw around, they're both reckless endangerment. \n\nAnother note: The word your using Slippery Slope for is actually called a False Equivalence. A slippery slope is when tiny event x leads to massive event y. And I'm not making a false equivalence; you're just misreading and misinterpreting my argument. \n\n&gt;Fuck off until you grow up and experience the freedom of a country where your nanny doesn't have to watch over you.\n\nSuch an eloquent debate. If you're from the US, this law is in effect there. So I don't know what the fuck you're talking about since our countries have the same response to this type of situation. \n\n&gt;Grow up\n\nand when I look at you, I throw up! It's a Stand By Me reference...nevermind.\n\n&gt;grow some balls\n\nDid that already.\n\n&gt;grow some cultural experience\n\nThe city I grew up in is five times older than your entire countries history. You probably couldn't fucking pronounce it's name properly in the native language. What culture has to do with this idfk but whatever...\n\n&gt;and grow on history\n\nlol wot m8? I think we both already know who the better historian here is.\n\n&gt;then you'll realize the silliness of detaining someone for days and stealing their equipment because they hopped over you.\n\nThe punishment for this crime is a 120 dollar fine...\n\n**THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363542900", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The story takes place in late June 2003. I was eighteen and I'd just finished my third year in College. Now some of you probably know that song by Leonard Cohen, *Teachers*. There are two lines that go\n\n&gt; I was handsome I was strong\n\n&gt; I knew the words to every song\n\nIn a very mediocre way, that's how I feel now about that summer. Of course, I was never handsome nor strong, but that's probably the best I've felt in my life. I'd finished sitting that year's final exams. I was exhausted but pretty happy.\n\nYou see, I had a plan. Together with friends and friends of friends, we were going to go on a road trip to a student festival ~400 miles away. I'd actually done a fair amount of organising to make it happen - I'd been writing emails and making calls for two weeks to work out the details. I'd focused on the transportation part of the equation while Q, my BFF, handled the accommodation side of things. Since we were students and pretty broke, the best/least worst option he found was to talk his ex-girlfriend into lending us the use of her tiny student flat for three days. Now I should mention that the former girlfriend in question had broken up with him only a few months prior and that there was a fair amount of hurt feelings and unresolved anger on his side. I mean, yeah it was gonna happen with her moving away but that doesn't mean it was easy for him. Or for her, for that matter. But you know, they were 'still friends'.\n\nThe plan was that there would be two cars. One leaving around 2pm with yours truly and 4 others, the other leaving a bit later with my friend Q and three other folks. The plan for Car A was to drive to our destination, meet up with a mutual friend who'd give us the keys to the flat, dump our bags and stuff there, grab a beer then drive to the party in a rented youth center out in the woods (*literally* in the woods).\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened. Now since I'd handled some of the organisation and was ***totes besties*** with Q to whom the keys were being entrusted, it was decided that I should keep the keys until the second car would rendezvous at the party an hour and a half after we'd gotten there. A simple enough plan.\n\nSo there I was, tired, pretty happy with myself and with the all-important keys in my pocket.\n\nBy this point, it's early evening and I've got a nice kind of buzz going. No sign of Car B, though. Well, nevermind. Surely they'd have called me if something had gone wrong.\n\nTwo hours later: OK, where the fuck is Car B? I'm getting worried now and I'm checking my Nokia 3210 every five minute. My Nokia 3210 which lives in my pocket. Next to the keys. Outside so I can call voicemail. In the woods. At night.\n\nI eventually got a voicemail message. Car B had some kind of mechanical problem (I can't remember what exactly) and had to be towed to a garage for repairs. They were going to be late, but the plan was unchanged: we'd meet up at that youth center facility-type thing in the sticks, get hammered and then drive to the flat to sleep.\n\nTwo in the morning: Car B is finally there! Woo! High fives all around!\n\nThe party is winding down a little but everything's all right and I can relax now. So lil' ol' Directed proceeds to hit the booze pretty hard.\n\n3:30 AM: right. They're closing down now. It was great. Time to head on home.\n\n&gt; Q: Yo Directed, you got the keys?\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, sure right there.\n\nI reach in my pocket. I feel for keys. I pull keys. Ah, those are my own keys from before I left that morning. Hold on. Why does my pocket feel so light now? I reach again. Nothing. Try the other pocket. No keys.\n\n#Edvard_Munch_The_Scream.jpg\n\n***FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK***\n\nOk. ***Shitshithshitshitshit***. OK. They can't be very far. You must have dropped them when you were out there in the woods. Right. You definitely put them in your pocket when they were given to you, so that's where you must have dropped them. ***fuckfuckshitcockcuntcheesedickfuckCOCK***\n\nI step outside and head in the general direction of where I went outside to check my voicemail. There's a wee bit of moonlight, but basically no oher source of illumination. I explain the situation to one of the security dudes and ask if he could lend me his Maglite.\n\n# U WOT M8\n\nSo there I was, crouching in the fucking woods to try and detect the glint of a goddamn door key by moonlight.\n\nAt that point, my friends have twigged that something's gone wrong and we're not gonna be able to sleep at Q's GF's place. We're all pretty tired and the security guys don't want us around.\n\nWe need a plan B. One of the lads in Car A is pretty friendly with a guy we kind of all knew casually who has a place somewhere in the city centre. We get there at the break of dawn and crash for a few hours. That guy and his boyfriend are laughing their fucking heads off at our misery when I explain the situation. And they're right, too.\n\nThe following morning.\n\nSo it's ten something in the morning. We've slept, which is good. There is toast. Toast is good. There are two cars, nine dudes and a set of keys lost in the woods. What do?\n\nQ wisely decides that the first order of business is to get the other set of keys to his ex's student flat, since that's where we in Car A left out stuff. Of course, that means seeing her which was never part of the plan. Since I'm the one who fucked up I tag along. Several calls later, we manage to locate his ex - let's call her C. She's staying with her new boyfriend. I knock at the door. Dude answers.\n\n&gt; Dude: Hey.\n&gt; Me: Hi, I'm Directed, I'd like to talk to C.\n&gt; Q:...\n&gt; C: Hi Directed! (she knew me from before she moved). Hi Q!\n&gt; Q: Hi C.\n\nSo I explained to C that I'd lost the keys to her own goddamn place while Q and C's then-boyf were alternately seizing each other, looking at C and looking at me in dismay. I don't know how to convey the sheer cringeworthiness of that moment but it was pretty intense. I'm genuinely amazed that I'm still friends with Q. The man's a saint.\n\nAnyway, we eventually got the other set of keys which I basically refused to even touch. Strictly from the point of view of fucking up with the keys, that was basically the end of it except I had to drain my bank account to pay for the lock change after we left. I had nightmares for two years after that and to this day I refuse to be entrusted with someone else's keys. It doesn't sound like much but in hindsight that summer, and those few days in particular mark the point I peaked. It's all been downhill since then.\n\nThere's more to that road trip, though. Like the unfortunate incident with the Peltier effect module or that time on the second day when V (Car B's driver) and I went on a rescue mission to get some students we didn't know from their budget motel to the festival itself. I was riding shotgun and there were these three kids (I mean, technically they were older than me but it was their first year in College) sitting in the back. V had the Ride of the Valkyries playing on repeat at maximum volume for the whole trip while he was redlining the engine on the motorway and talking to his tulpa in the rear view mirror. For my part, I spent the trip channelling Sgt. Kilgore from Apocalypse Now and shouting at them/expounding on the genius of Hunter Thompson. You know that scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas where Hunter and his attorney pick up a hitchhiker and absolutely *terrify* him?

{"body": "I had this happen to me once. Just a little back story to explain why I went along with it:\n\nIt had been a long day, but not a busy one. I had already been to all the usual \"hot spots\" around town without any any luck. It was a cold night too, so nobody wanted to walk around, but that also meant that people weren't going out much if they didn't have a car. \nI work for myself, so that means that I don't have a dispatcher. I prefer not to work for a taxi cab company because they usually rip off the taxi drivers for using their services, they are basically a relay service for us but I opted not to take part I that mostly because of money. \nWhat this means is that I rely on the usual customers instead, which I have acquired over the many years as a cab driver but my phone wasn't ringing that night. \nFinally, at the last hotspot stop I would make before stopping for lunch, I saw somebody looking around with their hands up waving up and down. I figured, they must be hailing a taxi. I stopped next to him, and he jumped in and yelled at me in a British accent to hurry up and follow the red car. Now, normally I wouldn't agree with this, but I wasn't having any luck so far, and I wanted to be able to at least have some extra cash so I didn't have to get dollar menu McDonalds. So I obliged.\nThe red car had just finished making a right turn, and I sped after him so I wouldn't lose him.While I'm on my way, I ask the guy why we were following him. He looks at me, and says \"Don't fookin ask me any questions mate, just catch up to him and I'll tell ya\" or something like that anyways. That bothered me a bit, but I figured that it must have been his girlfriend which had just gotten in an argument or something and he was probably still pissed off. I caught up to the car, and when I was about 3 car lengths away from the red car, the British guy tells me to slow down, and not get any closer. That's when I started to think this guy was up to no good. I told him that I wouldn't drive him any further until he told me what was going on. His response was \"Fookin yankee, let me the fook out then\" He gets out, and yells \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?\" so I tell him, \"I need about... tree fiddy\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363833841", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -9, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "We’ve had quite a lot to say about SimCity but I haven’t told you wot I think yet. I posted my\ninitial impressions two weeks ago, feeling like I’d only just scratched the surface. I’ve been\nscratching away since then, off and on, and now I’m ready to tell you what lies beneath.\n\nThe conversation, cozening and confusion that flared up following SimCity’s unhappy launch threatened to drown out discussion of the game that resided somewhere in the hinterland\nbetween a distant server and PCs across the land. The internet loves a narrative and the one\nthat was forming pre-launch and in the first week or two after release suggested that the hero of\nthis particular tale was a noble and complex city simulator; the villain was social gaming, always-\nonline, DRM and enforced multiplayer.\n\nI’m not going to spend a great deal of time talking about the villainy here because I’d be repeating\nwhat others have said already and it’s not the focus of this particular word-load. My take on the\nserver issues boils down to a deep, exasperated sigh when they fail to work and, after playing for\nthis long, a slightly shallower sigh when they do allow me to enter. SimCity, as the reconstructed\nnarrative has mostly taken into account, is no hero trapped inside a digital dungeon. It’s a minor\ntrifle, a troubled toy that, like so many childhood Christmas presents, is most enjoyable as it’s\nbeing unwrapped.\n\nZones and roads, that’s what you’ll need to mayor your way to the top. Zones, as ever in the\nsimulated cities of Maxis-land, can be industrial, commercial or residential. I’ve experimented with\nall kinds of patterns, including a radical industrial-residential core with a commercial district at the\nother side of the map, literally surrounded by shit and garbage. That city, like the rest, filled up.\nResidential demand was high, the basic services were in place and, after five or six hours, profits\nwere high.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I wrote this: “It’s lovely to see a world grow and to nudge it in a new direction\noccasionally”. I stand by that. The first time you fill a map, the city, with its various tiny districts\nand carefully laid out streets, is your creation, a model of efficiency, fizzing with personality. It only\ntakes a few hours and then you can either wait for your bank account to fill up and buy an expo\ncentre, or something else fancy, or drop parks everywhere and watch happy faces exploding into\nthe polluted air above the sims’ houses. The miniscule size of the areas means you’ll never be\nable to have everything you want – building that expo centre will mean knocking down some\nhouses, factories or shops – because every inch of flat ground is taken up quickly, and anything\nthat isn’t flat is only good for roads.\n\nSpeaking of which, as Doc Brown might say, ‘where we’re going we’re going to need a fuckload of\nroads’. They transport everything, from shit to shoppers, and while it’s a neat solution for a\nsimplified network of connections, it causes oddities. In one of my towns, the power station is\nplaced as far from residential areas as possible and since it cannot be connected by power lines,\nbecause they don’t exist, electricity is carried down a dirt road instead. When the city became\novercrowded, with every road except the one to the power station upgraded to maximum density, I\nwas initially baffled by the traffic jams that held up fire engines and ambulances, causing the\ndeath toll to rise and the population to become slightly less ecstatic. I built a couple of skate parks\nto compensate for the unnecessary fatalities and people immediately stopped complaining. Parks\nare soma and, as long as there’s a swingset nearby, a wife won’t mourn her dead husband or be\npissed off that he was on fire for sixteen hours before help arrived.\n\nI wanted to understand the problem because it was annoying from an aesthetic and logistical\npoint of view, even if it didn’t actually make much of a difference to the prosperity and happiness\nof my surviving sims. It was the dirt road. Even though I’d only intended it to lead to the power\nstation, I’d zoned industrial areas along its length because space is very much at a premium and I\ncouldn’t afford to waste the land – people need jobs, after all, or so I thought at the time.\nEverything went down that road. Fire engines, cop cars, commuters, ambulances – the entire\npopulation of the city drove up to the station and back down again, honking and grinding their\ngears in the heavy traffic – they couldn’t pass it without deciding to take a detour.\n\nWhen a simulation unexpectedly lobs a spanner toward my works, I’m usually overjoyed. Systems\npushed to their limits are one of life’s joys, whether it’s physics modelling causing bizarre\ngyrations or a dwarf dooming a fortress by opening the wrong door at the wrong time because he\nfancies a brew. Suddenly, elephants. SimCity does throw disasters at the player but they are\nMalthusian natural checks rather than entertainments or actual calamities. Each ‘city’ is just about\nfinished after five or six hours of play – the map is full and all of the pieces are in place. A natural,\nsupernatural or entirely unnatural disaster is the slightly more spectacular equivalent of\nsomebody removing a few pieces from a completed jigsaw so that it can be completed again.\n\nThe real disasters are the confused vehicles and people, driven by path-finding and urges that\nmake me long for the abstracted models of old. I love the idea of a city that is driven by moving\nparts, a machine rather than mathematics, but SimCity is not that game. Once a map has been\nfilled, the next is much the same and the small areas and repetitive structure make for an\nexperience that allows little space for interesting design and instead becomes a slog of zoning\nand linking. The moment that I realised my input was barely essential, beyond the initial setup,\nSimCity became a colourful, cartoon screensaver. A colourful, cartoon screensaver that required\na constant internet connection.\n\nMost of my time has been spent developing single player regions, which is a perfectly viable\nstrategy, but I’ve also dabbled in a spot of neighbourly sharing. The social aspects of the game –\nand social is the right word; other people have a mostly numerical presence but aren’t actually\npresent – don’t contribute anything of great significance and certainly nothing to counterbalance\nthe more fundamental problems. These cities are constructed on shale and sham, spouting\nresources to power yet more inconstant constructions.\n\nTwo weeks after writing my initial impressions, I’ve had my fill. If EA do shut the SimCity servers\ndown in a couple of years, removing the game from existence, I can’t imagine that millions of\nvoices would cry out right before the SimSilence. I know people who are enjoying the game,\nimposing their own rules and restrictions, or simply satisfying themselves with different\nexperimental shapes and styles. Even though I’ll never be one of those toybox tinkerers, it’s worth\nrepeating that they should be able to enjoy the game whenever and wherever they are.\nWhenever I load the game up, I’m tempted to start with a fresh plot, spurred on by the pleasure of\nplaying with the simple zoning and road-building tools. Everything sounds just right and the\ninterface is clean, bright and a joy to use. It only takes a few minutes for the sinking feeling to\nsettle in my stomach though. I’m going to end up doing the same things as I’ve done before,\nproducing money and resources to feed my hungry neighbours, specialising just a little but never\na lot, growing tired before the mini-metropolis is complete. The initial excitement as my first\nskyscrapers grew feels like a memory from an age of innocence and it’s one that I’d gladly revisit\nif I could. I’d need soma of my own to do that though.\n\nSimCity is a charming object but has more in common with a model railway set than a city building\nsimulation. The GlassBox engine, so attractive in theory, is unconvincing in practice, incapable of\nmaking me believe that even these small neighbourhoods are functioning, living spaces. For a\nwhile, I enjoyed watching new buildings sprout out of the ground like flowers in a time-lapse video,\nbut I’ve come to the conclusion that SimCity is showing me a lot, telling me very little and barely\nlistening at all.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363977441", "subreddit": "SimCity", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

That's why we send the absolute bare minimum regular soldiers and keep them chained up in the safer areas, to the point where they're ashamed to wear the uniform because they don't get to do anything. Of course Australians have never been occupation or garrison troops so all that patrolling the streets and getting blowed up by IED stuff doesn't interest us, but at the same time we can't just tell USA we will sign up for all the surges (offensive operations do interest us) and decline all the occupation work. Well, being Australia, I'm sure we actually did tell them that and they told us to fuck off.\n\nMeanwhile we've got marines based here now and are likely pushing for more, following Australia's age-old defence policy of leeching off allies to minimise our own spending. Canada does this with USA but that's completely different as they're America's hat; Australia does it, and has always done it, despite being isolated on the other side of the planet amongst possibly hostile neighbours. Shit we did it before we even had a navy; in the late 19th century we were essentially demanding that UK go to war with France and Germany over PNG. The only time we ever had a real military was in the latter half of WW2. In summary, contrary to the belief held by some that Australia is USA's (and was UK's) bitch, in fact we are simply the most arrogant, cheeky cunts out.\n\nthis rambling has been proudly brought to you courtesy of dexamphetamine", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364289170", "subreddit": "australia", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From RG Vengeful, the author of that thread:\n\nVIDEO LINK:\n\nhttp://uk.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-live/?event=halo-reborn-gdc-postmortem-20130329\n\nIt starts at around 45:00.\n\n\nCLIFFS:\n\n\"Historically, we've had these twod audiences in Halo.... Campaign and Multiplayer..... We wanted to bind them\"\n\n\"We wanted to create an experience where Campaign players could do well in Multiplayer, and introduce Multiplayer players into Campaign\".\n\n\"We wanted to help new players find success, help them get power weapons in ordnance that they might never have gotten a hold of before\"\n\n\"We want to make Halo more accessible and easier to succeed at\"\n\n\"Halo always had a steep learning curve that threw players off, we wanted to change that\"\n\n\"We listened to all the community feedback, and realised that players didn't want an even playing field and put a progression system in, which is what they wanted\" - U WOT M8?(p)\n\n\n\nI have just finished watching the panel at GDC. \n\nIt has been a reality check. A reality check that if you played CE - Halo 3, there is no more Halo like that any more.\n\n\nNot only is it an insult to state that the \"Community\" wanted a progression system, but it is false. How did you manage to survey the entire community and ask them what they wanted? \n\nYou are in a total state of self denial, 343.\n\nYou should have seen the Twitch.tv chat! Oh my god they were going absolutely mental at how many utter lies you were spouting, not to mention all the things you said that re-affirmed to a lot of people that Halo's direction is this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/h2MTcl9.png (Actual picture slide that was displayed at the event)\n\n\"We made Infinity Slayer so campaign kids could use power weapons in Multiplayer.\" - This is not how a multiplayer should be made. \n\n\"Steep learning curve that threw a lot of players off\" - Are you serious! Halo has always been a massive game because it takes skill, it's not like any other generic FPS like Battlefield or COD!.\n\n\nIt's almost as embarrassing that the \"X\"'s are broken. How do you screw this up? \"They will be displayed throughout the duration of your death\" - Kevin Franklin. \n\nNow... Was this a lie? Or did you not even PLAYTEST YOUR OWN -Yoinking!- GAME?\n\nHow do you screw this up? What was wrong with the old one? It seems like you have an EGO problem, you refuse to leave anything in the game that Bungie created.\n\nYou INSIST on redesigning EVERYTHING... Even if it's not broken. \n\n\nThe fact that it was called \"A Postmortem\" is quite right, expect they can't seem to see what killed Halo.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's funny is that no one at 343 actually reads these forums. Feedback is useless.\n\n40k Population.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, I am seriously mad. You put \"Halo\" on the box. I bought the game thinking it would have Halo Multiplayer (Thank you, Mr Audley) This is NOT Halo multiplayer.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364692553", "subreddit": "CompetitiveHalo", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Pricier meats tend to be more marbled (more fats) and will grill with a minimum of preparation - let the steak sit at room temp for 10 minutes or so, pat it dry with a paper towel, salt it, toss it on the grill. I like to brush a small amount of olive oil on it, particularly if I'm broiling it inside as opposed to grilling it outside. \n\nDon't fooking overcook it! Remember you can always put it back on the fire, but you cannot un-cook what has been cooked.  There is nothing worse than a hockey puck of a steak that cost you 20 bucks. The number of flips is irrelevant, other than how it will tend to lead to more cooking time.\n\nFor a cheap steak, like a london broil, I use a soy sauce, red wine, and garlic marinade, for about 12 hours before cooking - the acids in the wine help to tenderize the meat, and the sugars in the soy sauce help to create a crust when you sear it. \n\nVery important - when you cut the meat, cut across the grain (against the bias), and cut it on an angle somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees (to the cutting board).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364757365", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
