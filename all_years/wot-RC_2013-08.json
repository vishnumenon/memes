Pete Carroll is still a cheeky cunt, though. \n\nArizona, you're alright. Usually when you beat us it's after we've either clinched or been eliminated from the playoffs. Carson Palmer seems like a dick, but I really like Fitz. Kurt Warner was a class act, and even though he tore us apart for so many years with two of our division rivals, I like the guy a lot. I also rooted for you guys against the Steelers a few years back.\n\nRams, well, I really hate you guys. But you consistently play us well, and I can't really say anything bad about a team that *cringe* went undefeated against us last year. And your coach has a pretty nice moustache.\n\nDallas, I can't say you've ever posed a legit threat to us or anyone else since I've started watching football (~11-12 years ago), so my resent toward you is really more of a result of breeding than actual experience. But everything about you just really pisses me off. Jerry Jones is way too old to do anything, and Tony Romo is one of the most overrated quarterbacks I've ever witnessed. People forget that the most meaningful play he was ever involved in was a fucking botched snap. I always grin a little when the Cowboys are picked as the preseason favorites to win anything, because lofty expectations mean a more devastating blow when they inevitably come crashing down on you in the long run.

Also from what i've seen he's not even a particularly good player, and seems to win more due to his opponents incompetence than his own tactical brilliance.

Star Trek created \"trekkies\" and functioned as a kind of rallying point for those labeled \"nerds,\" people who would in many cases have been isolated otherwise. \n\nDistrict 9 garnered a following that I don't know of an exact label for, but I know it personally changed my life. I met my husband online as a result of that movie, we maintained a long-distance relationship for two years, and then I moved from the US to Canada to marry him. Just today we saw Elysium together, and I could not possibly be happier. Thank you for not only entertaining people like us, but for bringing us together.

{"body": "I wasn't planning on seeing Elysium really, but after seeing District 9 on television a few nights ago as well as the AMA with that fookin' guy from SA I decided I'd check it out. \n\nI hadn't read any reviews before going to the theater but the first thing that came to mind after walking outside was that there were some heavy political undertones and some people were not going to like it at all. \n\nFrom what I've seen in some of the comments here and some of the reviews which blast the \"leftist agenda\" in the film, I think a lot of people are looking at the film in the wrong way. Sure there is an underlying social/political message in the film, but I don't think it's a clean-cut 99.9% vs. 0.1%, evil rich vs righteous poor thing here. \n\nI'm not sure if this is what Blomkampf was going for, but the message I got was that humanity has failed. We long ago (should have?) evolved and passed the stage where we were just animals in survival mode. We have technology, knowledge, etc... but it has been used irresponsibly, or at least not to it's full potential. Instead of trying to preserve Earth, it was left to rot and consume itself because there was no profit (I'm not just talking monetarily) in it for those who had the power and resources to do so. Much like what we are facing now. Look at the energy industry for example, instead of beginning to deploy and utilize other sources of energy on a large scale, which are not perfect or 100% efficient, we look for more ways to drain every last bit of non-renewable energy from the Earth, just furthering dependence and ensuring more pollution as well as the eventual conflict that will come when reserves reach critically low levels. Why? Because the short-term profit is greater than looking at it long-term and the people raking in the money, with which comes great responsibility and power, do not give a damn what happens 10, 20, 30, or however many years after they're dead. Or take diseases/medical treatment for example, sure it would be extremely difficult to treat everyone with cancer, but in the U.S. we could easily give almost everyone access to preventative medicine, but we don't. In the news now, apparently there is a cure for malaria. Can we expect the pharmaceutical industry to make the vaccine cheap enough so that it can be deployed and dispersed to those who need it most in some of the poorest countries on the planet? I don't believe we can. It was somewhat the same in the film in that the people on Elysium saw no profit in helping the people on Earth, either to heal illness that could easily be done so with those machines or using the technology to make the planet more habitable.\n\ntl;dr The message that I got wasn't that it was the rich are evil or the 99% vs the 1%, it was about the failure of our species.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376072969", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

If they built on it more: Tamako and Midori. As someone else said, Isaac and Miria (I'm like only on ep 3 of Baccano! and they're the most enjoyable to watch). gon and killua for best brotp \n\nWhich anime character can you relate to the most?  \nKirino Kousaka. I don't like her or the anime, but at some points, we're really similar. not a teenage girl thats good at everything lol  \nBut I can't convince my brother to watch the anime I like, and I try so I can have someone to share my interest. I don't hide my power level though. But it's hard for me to associate with other anime fans.  \nno incest tho (in my anime and in my relationship)\n\nWhat's your least favorite anime genre? Why?     \nHarems. I don't like most romance anime (heck I don't even like romantic dramas) in general. High school \"romance\" anime genre comes pretty close too (cute girl, boring guy... some childhood friend- bam you've got a high school love triangle romcom... but at least it's funny and has other characters), but harem is worse. It just sells with fanservice, and always has a bland cast -full of overused tropes and cliche- used for fap. And the main characters are boring; I think they're just there for wish-fufillment. Reverse harems are even worse in some cases. I don't think I've ever finished a harem anime.    \n\nWhich anime do you want to watch, but just can’t get into?  \nBakemonogatari. I'm a huge fan of unique art styles but I got bored of it after ep 1 -which I finished- sorry r/anime.  \n\n/r/anime user I appreciate a lot is /u/Bobduh - he always makes detailed writeups for the anime I'm watching.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376105239", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Had it ever been crashed, dropped, or hit a curb or anything?  Improper weight distribution and bearing wear can cause this wobble; as can improper suspension setting, or other worn components.  Also, from my understanding acceleration is more likely to worsen head shakes, aka speed wobble.  That is just an FYI.  If I understand, yours was cause by a car bumping you or your handle bars.  I would think you should have pulled the clutch, coasted and covered the brakes, and like the others suggested hold with your thighs and light on the bars.  If you watch some racing those guys get head shakes when they're coming out of turns.  This is because they are accelerating and that front tire is almost floating.  If they're still leaning the uneven contact can pull the tire in a way the rider doesn't want it to, and it will naturally over correct itself, or if they are straights there may be enough unevenness in the road or track to cause the same thing when there is almost no load on the tire.  Legs tight hands loose is how I think they tend to ride it out.  You said you were doing 75 to 85 when the car turned toward you, they returned to their lane, then you WOT?  I suspect your front tire came off of the ground and your damper stopped the wobble since you said it stopped when you accelerated, but in the future I wouldn't try that.  I don't know about this resetting fork compression.  It sound like pseudoengineering to me.  That bike is going to accelerate incredibly quickly in 1st or 2nd gear when you're already at 75 or 85.

{"body": "First thing, let's begin by saying you're confusing *nation-states* with *nationality*. They two aren't the same and aren't even very related. \"Nationality\" is what \"took off\" 200 years ago (again not very accurate - it really \"took off\" only 150 year ago) while nation states have existed for decades before that.\n\nSo let's define some basic terms, simply because English lacks the clear-cut definition for these things: A \"nation\" is a group of people who share common characteristics. \"Nationality\" can either refer to the nation to which a person affiliates with, or the ideology which puts the nation at the center of policy making. Being \"nationalistic\" means being proud of one's own nationality.\n\nNations are split into two big groups: \"Ethnic nations\" and \"ideological/political nations\" (not actual technical terms, just my own descriptions). Ethnic nations are those based on shared ethnicity, culture, language, history or any combination of the 4. Ethnic nations are quite strict community, and it is hard to \"join\" an ethnic nation by the definition of it. Examples of ethnic nations include the Swedish, the English, the Germans, the Japanese, the Russians and so forth. These are all groups which share a common ethnicity and/or culture and/or language and/or history.\n\nThe second type of nation is the \"political\" or \"ideological\" nation. This refers to a group of people who get together because they share a common country and government, or they follow common ideals and pursuit common goals. Joining this type of nation is as simple as receiving citizenship from the country associated with it. The best example of this kind of nationality is the United State.\n\nA nation-state is, simply put, a centralized country which identifies itself (or is identified by others, including historians) with a certain nation. Nation-states are distinguished from empires in the way an empire controls many different peoples and nations without giving any single one of them special treatment (although, as 19th century colonialism has taught us, nation-states *can* be empires and still be nation-states, so it's is complicated). Nation states are a pretty damn old concept, and there's still quite a debate going on over which country was the \"first nation-state\".\n\nAlright. Got that? All terms are in place? Let's begin.\n\n&gt; Now try counting the number of conflicts caused by the idea of the nation state and the repression or displacement of minorities it effected\n\nNow try counting the number of conflicts *before* the popularization of the nation-state (and even before the popularization of nationality), try counting the number of repressed or displaced minorities for the sake of empires.  Consider for a moment that we are currently living in the most peaceful time in history. The modern nation-state has a lot to do with this relative peace. Whatever wars the invention of the nation-state appears to have caused are just fallout from ill-placed national borders. Simply put, wars between nation-states are just nation-states settling in and redrawing their borders according to where people live.\n\nJust look at Europe! What once was the ground for forever-bickering noblemen and dukes and kings to shed their vassals' blood for one little piece of land or another, is now one of the most peaceful places on earth. Sure, it took quite a load of wars to get to this point, but now Europe's borders have finally fallen into place and countries can finally co-exist in peace. This \"peace-through-war\" dynamic is best exemplified in the Yugoslav Wars of the 90's.\n\n&gt;Just take a look at South-East Asia, the Near and Middle East.... Not to mention the clusterfuck that is Africa in terms of borders\n\nYou're right. The nation-state really didn't take over the world. And you just listed why.

{"body": "First thing, let's begin by saying you're confusing *nation-states* with *nationality*. They two aren't the same and aren't even very related. \"Nationality\" is what \"took off\" 200 years ago (again not very accurate - it really \"took off\" only 150 year ago) while nation states have existed for decades before that.\n\nSo let's define some basic terms, simply because English lacks the clear-cut definition for these things: A \"nation\" is a group of people who share common characteristics. \"Nationality\" can either refer to the nation to which a person affiliates with, or the ideology which puts the nation at the center of policy making. Being \"nationalistic\" means being proud of one's own nationality.\n\nNations are split into two big groups: \"Ethnic nations\" and \"ideological/political nations\" (not actual technical terms, just my own descriptions). Ethnic nations are those based on shared ethnicity, culture, language, history or any combination of the 4. Ethnic nations are quite strict community, and it is hard to \"join\" an ethnic nation by the definition of it. Examples of ethnic nations include the Swedish, the English, the Germans, the Japanese, the Russians and so forth. These are all groups which share a common ethnicity and/or culture and/or language and/or history.\n\nThe second type of nation is the \"political\" or \"ideological\" nation. This refers to a group of people who get together because they share a common country and government, or they follow common ideals and pursuit common goals. Joining this type of nation is as simple as receiving citizenship from the country associated with it. The best example of this kind of nationality is the United State.\n\nA nation-state is, simply put, a centralized country which identifies itself (or is identified by others, including historians) with a certain nation. Nation-states are distinguished from empires in the way an empire controls many different peoples and nations without giving any single one of them special treatment (although, as 19th century colonialism has taught us, nation-states *can* be empires and still be nation-states, so it's is complicated). Nation states are a pretty damn old concept, and there's still quite a debate going on over which country was the \"first nation-state\".\n\nAlright. Got that? All terms are in place? Let's begin.\n\n&gt; Now try counting the number of conflicts caused by the idea of the nation state and the repression or displacement of minorities it effected\n\nNow try counting the number of conflicts *before* the popularization of the nation-state (and even before the popularization of nationality), try counting the number of repressed or displaced minorities for the sake of empires.  Consider for a moment that we are currently living in the most peaceful time in history. The modern nation-state has a lot to do with this relative peace. Whatever wars the invention of the nation-state appears to have caused are just fallout from ill-placed national borders. Simply put, wars between nation-states are just nation-states settling in and redrawing their borders according to where people live.\n\nJust look at Europe! What once was the ground for forever-bickering noblemen and dukes and kings to shed their vassals' blood for one little piece of land or another, is now one of the most peaceful places on earth. Sure, it took quite a load of wars to get to this point, but now Europe's borders have finally fallen into place and countries can finally co-exist in peace. This \"peace-through-war\" dynamic is best exemplified in the Yugoslav Wars of the 90's.\n\n&gt;Just take a look at South-East Asia, the Near and Middle East.... Not to mention the clusterfuck that is Africa in terms of borders\n\nYou're right. The nation-state really didn't take over the world. And you just listed why. All these places you just said are just post-colonial clusterfucks where arbitrarily-drawn colonial borders turned into countries. These aren't nation-states, these are just shaky regimes often controlling several unrelated (and even *hostile*) rival tribes and nations. All the conflicts which took place in the places you listed are again a manifestation of the \"peace-through-war\" dynamic, and these conflicts will continue until the countries' borders match the people living there.\n\n&gt;or Eastern Europe\n\nWhat's wrong with eastern Europe?\n\n&gt;The USA\n\n...is a perfect sense of the second type of nation I talked to you about. It *is* a nation-state.\n\n&gt;China\n\n...is problematic and has imperial characteristics. You're right about this one.\n\n&gt;Australia\n\nu wot m8?\n\n&gt;Brazil\n\nI don't know anything about it so I can't comment.\n\n&gt;the EU\n\n...isn't a country. Ehhhh..... Again, very complicated and very controversial.\n\n&gt;Russia \n\n...has retained a lot of its imperial legacy, even after the collapse of 1991, but is still a nation-state.\n\n&gt;the strongest empire in the world, the USA, aren't a nation state in the traditional sense\n\nFirst thing, the USA isn't an empire (unless you're the kind of nutjob who loves talking about American \"neo-imperialism\" or \"oil-imperialism\" or whatever).

Said roof had a huge slant, I slide down it fall of the side, down about 30ft, falling through all the trees, Balls swollen and how I did not kill or impale myself I'll never know.\n\nAge 13, school trip. We have to get a Train. On the train myself and the lads were sticking our heads out the window and seeing how far we could spit. I've a big fooking head let it be said, I'm the kind of kid who grew into their head. Anyway, my fat heard out the window as far as it goes spitting away, I pull my head back and withing a split second of having my head back in the train a train fly's by on the other side going the opposite direction. I'm not kidding, if it were not for my Buddy calling me, I would have been decapitated. My buddy was white like a ghost and said your one lucky lucky guy.\n\nAge 14, playing on the extension to my parents house. The roof was beneath my bedroom. I got out onto roof and there is a big cavity block hold up a gutter. I start to move it and my mother called me. I left the big block were it was and went to my mum. I did what she wanted and I went out the back to have a smoke. Yes my stupid self was smoking at 14. So I was hiding behind the extension smoking away when all of a sudden that block on top of the extension comes crashing down and misses my head and body by inches, its just dropped 14 ft and it had of hit my head, I was brown bread / Dead.\n\nIt did not get any better as I aged in my Teens. At 18, I went to Amsterdam which a bunch of my friends. We were getting fucked up each day, great Craic. Anyway, this one evening, we got some really good clean XTC. Took pills, flying along, we jump on a tram to take us to the other side of town to a Rave. \n\nAll excited and fucked up on Tram, our stop arrives. What do I do, I hit the open button on the door, door opens, I jump of top step and all's I hear is screeching breaks and a Taxi missed me by millimeters. I jumped out of the wrong side of the Tran into traffic and again, how I was not killed still baffles me. As I was was XTC at this moment the experience was so intense I got the best rush of my Life and it was only the next morning it hit me as to what happened and how luck I was to still be alive.\n\nLucky enough, as my 20's went on I've had no more incidents basically because I'm less of a stupid cunt than I was when I was a teenager.

{"body": "&gt;Refute me then.\n\nAlrighty, internet forum warrioring is go.\n\nYour post is intended to convince the reader that TEST is failcascading. Clearly you are either new to null or completely oblivious, because the fact stands that TEST has been failcascading for the past three years since it's conception. **TEST is the living, breathing embodiment of the failcascade**, and all the drama that goes along with it is a huge part of their culture. \n\n* Your first point of evidence to *prove* that TEST is cascading is the way in which the MilDir situation with Beffah was handled, so lets get the facts straight: Beffah was TESTs only MilDir after she replaced Medea, and was individually holding a position that was intended for 3+ people; a Military Director rather than a Directorate. One of the problems with having a single director is that the task of coordinating every single op for a 13k+ person alliance is a 23.5/7 job - not something that can be realistically handled be one person. Beffah, however, is a fucking trooper and put in a frankly insane amount of time, effort, and sleep in order to keep things running smoothly. This system of having a single MilDir is not sustainable as it makes the entire war machine dependent on the activity of a single person and therefore much more vulnerable. The combination of getting burnt out, real life pooping on her metaphorical floor, and her internet shitting a brick effectively removed Beffah from all alliance functions. During the time she was unreachable (except through skype, but seriously, fuck skype) the CFC made large gains in the previously stalemate-y fountain war. Booda realized that shit was fucked and began the process of finding an additional director in order to get the train back on the rails. Beffah was included in every thread. When Ingen, a bro who had previously had experience in MilDir, was selected, a ping went out congratulating him on his new position. Beffah (conjecture) interpreted this to mean that she had been spacefired without even being notified, and proceeded to post a self-righteous callout thread talking about her contributions to the alliance and crying about being replaced. Well, she wasn't being replaced (although with her lack of activity, I don't think anyone could fault Booda if he had), simply augmented, but she left anyways for greener pastures.\n\n* Second, you talk about the TEST forums, saying that TEST trolls are ripping people who post serious eve business. Obviously, you've never actually had access to the TEST forums, because if you had you would better understand the Alliance Discussion (subforum). The AD is just about the most toxic environment inside TEST, but this is how it has been for ages. It indicates absolutely nothing special.\n\n* Third, our diplos are burning bridges. u wot m8? I assume this comment goes back to the goon drama surrounding Viktor, but clearly you've not kept up to date - he got booted during the restructuring in part because of the Dysphonia/DingoGS drama which he helped create.\n\n* Fourth, you say that the current leaders are bailing. This is your most accurate point thus far, it's very correct. Many of them received offers from S2N, NC., PL, and others, and many of them took those offers often bringing their corps along for the ride (dys0n lol). TEST is going to have a challenging couple months rebuilding, but that's what happens after you lose a war, you shed the hangers on, and you lose many key elements of your group, but you persevere. \n\n* Finally, you claim that corps are bouncing because they can't handle low-sec. It's not that, it's the conditions that go along with not having sov. No moongoo combined with no more rent money means that the alliance income will be dramatically lower and therefore programs such as SRP will suffer. Many of the corps leaving simply aren't used to paying out of pocket for their ships and prefer to fly with a group that will cover the cost for them, a perfectly admirable desire.\n\n**TL;DR: Get ~~fucked~~ refuted.**\n\nIn conclusion, [slopes on slopes](http://i.imgur.com/nBWCYZ0.png).\n\nHonestly though, your posting is quite prolific so if you like, we could hop in a mumble somewhere and get you educated.\n\nCheers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376601439", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

That one throwaway comment pretty much shows that you and maybe TEST in general have a \"get fucked\" attitude toward members that do most of the heavy lifting. Are you just a line member? Because if that mentality is shared by the rest of the alliance, it's no wonder people are jumping ship to PL or wherever.\n\nAlso, why the fuck was she shouldering the whole load of a bloc level war solo? You didn't think of something obvious like redudancy or teamwork? Hindsight 20/20 i guess. \n\n&gt; AD is just about the most toxic environment inside TEST, but this is how it's been for ages\n\nSo, your saying that that is the culture of TEST. It's always been that way, and that member just need to deal with it. Obviously people are going into that subforum, and obviously it's fucking with people morale. I don't understand why this shit wasn't squared away before this war. Nevermind the war, why wasn't this ever addressed previously? Because 'TEST is bad at Eve\". You guys wear it like a badge of honor. It's not. It's frustrating because the people who prop up the alliance to give you content, are being blasted for being ~tryhards~.\n\n&gt; Diplos burning bridges. u wot m8? \n\nThis goes back to fucking Sort Dragon. That whole situation should have been handled better. If you wanna go into a in depth analysis of just what-the-fuck-happened then be my guest. \n\n&gt;Current leaders are bailing.\n\nThank you for agreeing. I have been talking about the reasons why they have been bailing. Losing a huge war isn't the reason. There are deeper issues. \n\n&gt;conditions that go along with not having sov\n\nMy alliance doesn't even hold sov, we make plenty of isk holding onto our low sec constellation. It's not offical, and aren't making as much money as the power blocs are, but for a 350ish man alliance it isn't bad. You state there is no moongoo. There is *plenty* of moongoo. Aridia isn't a dead region, like people state. It is only quiet because the major conflict drivers such as the R64's have already been snatched up. Go and get them. Hell it should be easier for you guys. Blob anyone who tries to defend. If your POS gets hit, well it's the only timer that will come up. In fact, you guys might enjoy being freed from the shackles of sov.

The accused has recently committed reposting acts of which could be tried on their own, However because these reposts, [exhibits A - E] have not been tried in court, and the accused has already been convicted for reposting, the prosecution sets forth a charge of Aggravated Karma Whoring (**Karma Whoring negligent to the courts and prior convictions**) \n\nThe accused is a repeat offender with no stopping in sight, *he must be brought down*. \n\n* 1 CHARGE OF REPEATING DOUCHEBAGGERY - The prosecution brings forth this charge as the accused is has been convicted of douchebaggery in the past, and continues to repeat this douchbaggery. The prosecution would like to remind the courts that this charge is applied to karmawhoring as \"The accused stole karma in a douchebag way\"\n\n* 1 COUNT OF USING THE WORD CHEEKY - Notice EXHIBIT F, he is calling an officer of the LAW a cheeky cunt, it is apparent this cat has been traind to do 3 things in life, meow, repost, and use the word cheeky. Who the hell does this cat think he is?\n\n* 1 COUNT OF WOOP DA KARMA - It is obvious the accused woops the karma, its a crime he hasnt been brought up on this charge before. BAD KITTY! BAD! \n_____\n\nAll the prosecution ask of the jury is to look past the fact we are prosecuting a cat, I know it may be cute, but its gonna steal your content when you are not looking. \n\n*ends statement, exit stage left, grabs cheapest rum from the jury stand on the way out*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376663283", "subreddit": "KarmaCourt", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Got free tickets to a Garbage show once, had the time of my life. Shirley Manson held court like royalty, sang like an angel, and put her leg up on the monitor, confirming that she was wearing no panties. One of the few times I have unashamedly boogied at a show. She told the audience the drummer was leaving the tour to play for Air Supply, and there was much laughing and derision as she called him a \"Fooking coont.\"  Left with my cheeks hurting from smiling so much. A delightful surprise.\n\nWorst was not in terms of performance (though I have those too) but utter personal embarrassment. Gf gave me tickets to see Mike Doughty. Huge fan of Mike and his former band Soul Coughing. Show up hella early. Catch him coming into the place. Get to say hi, gush a little. Go to the spot, stake out an awesome table.\n\nShow starts. Everyone sings along to the old stuff, listens raptly to new stuff. Lots of love. Super shitty acoustics. At one point, bitch walks through performance space chatting, loud enough that Doughty stops singing and parrots her words back. Asks for quiet in the busy bar area.\n\nDude stands in front of our table having a chat. Gf upset. Ask guy to move. He gets surly. Explain that I have paid to see Doughty, not listen to him chat up bar skanks. He feels that paying a cover allows him to do as he likes, and suggests I go sit down.\n\nThis is a bad thing to do. There is shoving. Eventually he gets a chop to the throat, and there is some 'rasslin'. \n\nMusic stops again.\n\nMike is addressing us now. Suggesting that the \"bar bullshit\" stop and we give our kind attention to a \"tired folk singer.\" Bar Dude makes his way to the back patio. I return to my seat and stare at my feet for the rest of the show.\n\nI had a CD I would have like to get signed, and there was no way in hell I was going up to him. Fuck.\n\nFun post script: The next night, Gf took me to a friend's art opening. I was excited because there was free beer. It took thirty minutes to drive there, ten to park, five to walk to the gallery, and we open the door and Bar Dude is standing there. She hugs her friend and we went right back out the door.

Totally different game with the shots calling and the formations and the rotationing GLAVIN from pub chaostardery. If you go that route, hellcat is very useful.

{"body": "**Attention all, it is time for my statement.**\n\nJudge, jury, prosecution, me from the future looking back at old cases, I am here to show you that my defendant is, in fact, a good little kitty. Imagine, if you will, a world where my defendant has not been convicted of douchebaggery before today. Then, the charge of repeated douchebaggery would make absolutely no sense here. Well, it's not hard, seeing as that world in this one. Look back at my client's previous cases. Not once was he convicted of douchebaggery. Therefore, there cannot be a charge of repeating the douchebaggery.\n\n* The charge of using the word cheeky: I do not see a problem with using this word. It's just a word. It's not even an offensive word. If I were having that conversation my defendant had that lead him to use the phrase \"cheeky cunt\" in my workplace, I would honestly think nothing of it. This is not a criminal charge, it should not even be included, it's not worth people's time.\n\n* Woop da Karma. There's a new one. The act of \"wooping da karma right out from under our noses.\" Sounds like just a basic repeat of the charge of Karma Whoring. I can see no difference between the two charges. One is charging my client of doing things purely for karma, the other is claiming my client \"woops karma out from under\" redditors. Where's the difference here?\n\n* Speaking of Karma Whoring, isn't that a charge, too? Oh, yeah, there it is. The one with the evidence that is mostly out of date. We cannot charge my client with crimes committed more than 21 days before. If you look at the submission dates of most of those exhibits, the only one less than 21 days old is exhibit A. And even that one, the last time that picture was submitted to reddit was over a year ago. My client was well within his right reposting that image.\n\nIn closing, words. Also, hello future me! How are things going? Are you finally registered as a lawyer yet?\n\nEdit: Hi, past me! I am! Some stuff was going on with a modbot and applications weren't getting through, but it's all good now. I haven't been active on the sub lately, though. Turns out you get into anime at some point, and now have a successful sub based on a character. Weird, right? Anyway, even more future me, let me know, when you get the chance, what happens with the sub later on. Is it still going strong? Is Waysider still posting daily? Are we competing with Tatsuya yet?

When I write a proposal, or send my Mom an email, or go out to a bar with buddies, I use a totally different style of communication each time.  My 11th grade social economics teacher really crystallized it best.  She used the example of Ebonics.  She explained that it is a self-standing, identified language, and even she and her partner used it at home.  But then she looked at specific students--those who spoke a fairly poor black accented English in class, and were capable of standard English--and said, \"If you expect to use Ebonics during a job interview--or in my class--and expect to get ahead, then I don't want to know what you're smoking.  There is a time and place for different styles of communication, but my class isn't one of them.\"\n\nSo, wot m8, not so -, eh?

To answer your points, Francois barely played last year, and everyone following the Niners has said that Williams has looked better than Sopoaga.

Also, the 49ers drafted Lemonier and Carradine for the purpose of rotation in case you were wondering. The fact that you guys had trouble blocking the Packers front seven should be worrisome because you play arguably the best front 7 week 2, and you can't even block Clay Matthews.

{"body": "The 1920s Progressive movement of which the Brownlee government was a part advocated eugenics, including the sexual sterilization of so-called \"mental defectives\" to improve the genetic quality of the human race.[61] First-wave feminists such as Nellie McClung made public appeals to \"save\" mentally retarded girls from pregnancy. The medical profession suggested that many inmates of insane asylums could be safely released but for the concern that they would procreate.u wot m8sicians—to mandate the sterilization of any psychiatric patient if it was \"unanimously of the opinion that the patient might be safely discharged if the danger of procreation with its attendant risk of multiplication of the evil by transmission of the disability to progeny were eliminated\". Permission of the patient was nominally required, but permission of the nearest relative could be substituted in cases where the board considered the patient not mentally competent.\nA photographic portrait of a bald white man with thick-rimmed glasses\nHenry Wise Wood was an important ally of Brownlee's in the UFA.\n\nThe Liberals and Conservatives opposed the bill, as did two of the five Labour members. Nor were the UFA members unanimous in the legislation's support: Maurice Conner abstained, and thirteen others—including Archibald Matheson, who had made early attempts to have the bill die on the order paper—were absent for the final vote. Even so, the bill passed by a vote of 31 to 11. The next day, posters appeared along Jasper Avenue advocating the sterilization of George Hoadley, Brownlee's Minister of Health and the bill's sponsor.\nRelationship with the UFA\n\nDuring the first part of Brownlee's premiership, the presidency of the UFA was still held by his old friend and ally Henry Wise Wood. Wood's considerable influence helped hold in check the organization's more radical elements, who were generally antagonistic to the cautious and conservative Brownlee.[64] Even so, Foster and Byrne suggest that towards the beginning of Brownlee's term, he started to replace Wood as the \"centre\" of the UFA in a way that Greenfield had not.[65][66] Despite this, his relationship with the UFA grassroots was sometimes stormy. The 1929 UFA convention saw vocal criticisms of Brownlee's failure to adopt the old age pension and his decision to withdraw the Debt Adjustment Act in the face of opposition from banks. He also rejected the notion, dear to many UFA members, that a UFA government should be bound by the resolutions of the UFA membership. He felt that the heated atmosphere of UFA conventions did not lend itself to the development of prudent policy, and that the government of Alberta ought to be accountable not only to UFA members but to the population at large.[67]\n\nNot helping matters, the UFA, once a populist mass movement, was beginning to lose touch with its grassroots. In advance of the 1926 election, several constituencies had trouble generating the interest necessary for a nomination meeting.[5] While the UFA membership strongly endorsed Baker's proposed educational reforms, it soon emerged that a large majority of farmers opposed them.[59] Such incidents only reinforced Brownlee's disinclination to accept marching orders from UFA convention resolutions.\nDepression and scandal (1930–34)\n1930 election\nMain article: Alberta general election, 1930\n\nBrownlee wanted to call an election in 1929 after his government won control of Alberta's natural resources, but could not convince his cabinet or his caucus. Taking advantage of a period of increased popularity to call an early election was considered immoral by many in the UFA, the sort of thing that the old-style parties might try but which the UFA had been elected to hold itself above.[68] As such, an election was not held until June 19, 1930, four years less nine days after the previous one.[69]\n\nBrownlee was the campaign's dominant figure, and gave 67 speeches around the province. He stressed the UFA government's experience and contrasted it with the Liberals' and Conservatives' lack thereof. Having signed the resource agreement, he asked for a mandate to administer its implementation. In response to claims that a strong opposition was needed to exercise a check on his certain-to-be-re-elected government, he restated his view of government as \"the administration of business\" by saying \"an opposition is a thing that is no more needed in the public business of this Province ... than in the management of the affairs of any of our large corporations.\"[69] Byrne suggests that Brownlee arrived at this belief rationally but, once he had done so, \"adhered to [it] with an almost religious conviction\".[70]\n\nThe election gave the UFA a slightly reduced majority, with 39 of the legislature's 63 seats. Labour candidates, on behalf of many of whom Brownlee campaigned, won a further four. The Liberals remained the official opposition with eleven members, while the Conservatives returned six. The remaining three seats were won by independent candidates.\nCollapse of agricultural prices\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Alberta's economy was heavily reliant on wheat, and in 1930 the price of wheat began to fall drastically. From its peak of $1.78 per bushel in summer 1929, by February 1930 it had fallen to $1.07 because of world oversupply and dumping by the Soviet Union and Argentina.[71] By March it had reached $1.00, a level at which most Alberta wheat farmers could not profit.[72] By the fall, it had had fallen below $0.60 and by the end of the year to $0.45.[73][74] Other agricultural products, especially cattle, poultry, and eggs, saw similar or greater price decreases.[75]\nTwo people in an automobile hitched to two horses\nAs the depression worsened, \"Bennett buggies\" became a common sight. Cars with their engines removed because their owners couldn't afford gas, they were named after the increasingly unpopular Prime Minister.\n\nIn February 1930 Brownlee advocated a federally guaranteed minimum price to farmers of $0.70 per bushel of wheat.[76] In November he asked new Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, with whom he had practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous, to stabilize wheat \"at some reasonable price\".[77] Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable in the face of a global oversupply of 400 million bushels.[73] Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers, many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans.[78] Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance, but only quietly and only in the last resort; he was concerned that a well-publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms, knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would.[79] When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks' loans to farmers for binder twine, he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government.[80] To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans, he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter.[81] As he had hoped, this threat enhanced lenders' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers' payments did not even cover interest.[82] Despite these minor successes, Brownlee's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished.[83] It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat, part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply.[84]\nA large cloud of dust next to a farm\nConditions during the \"Dirty Thirties\" sometimes gave rise to dust storms, such as this July 1933 storm near Okotoks.\n\nA second consequence of collapsing wheat prices was the threat they posed to the Alberta Wheat Pool (AWP). Falling prices and the attendant tightened credit conditions led the Pool, along with its counterparts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to seek help from its provincial government in 1930. Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool, but told the legislature that he did not expect this guarantee to prove necessary, since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell \"to a level never reached on Canadian markets\".[72] In October 1930, with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $1.00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers, the banks refused to loan more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency (CSA) a general manager acceptable to the banks.[73] Brownlee and Premiers John Bracken of Manitoba and James Thomas Milton Anderson of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir George Perley, seeking direct federal aid to the Pools.[85] The premiers' pleas rejected, CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers. The first was John McFarland, former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company. The second was Brownlee. The banks chose McFarland.[86] Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance: he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto capital expenditures, and he required it to increase its sales commission from three quarters ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377641555", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Only do it if you truly love being outdoors and doing some manual labor. Either zoology or ecology degrees will open the doors to pretty much the same jobs. You will have to intern if you want a job because they all require experience. Its a great field. Fisheries and ornithology related jobs are more plentiful on the whole than mammology jobs. For ecology, decide which systems you like most and focus on them as much as possible (rivers, forests, lakes, prairies, etc). Keep good grades for grad schools. I do know people that are very happy being technicians. They travel a lot, Costa rica, pacific northwest, midwest, australia, bahamas; but don't get paid much. You'll need biology, statistics, and ecology courses. Good luck. Its a great field if you like the work. I do. I get paid for doing something I really enjoy.
