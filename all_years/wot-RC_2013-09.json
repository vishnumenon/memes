{"body": "&gt;I consistently see 45% 300 WN7 arties just click people like it's nothing and do at least 1k damage or so. \n\nArtillery players are judged differently in terms of damage. An \"average\" heavy or medium player is doing his HP pool in damage in any given game. Obviously this doesn't work for SPG's as you're doing your pool in about one hit. 1K damage is pretty mediocre for the mid-tier arties. Even more so since XP and Credit income on SPG's is (was?) gimped. You can output 1k damage in three or four hits.\n\n&gt;Sometimes I see Unicum arties miss half their shots.\n\nSo, what you're telling me is that unicum arty players are the ones who are not impacting the game, but 45%er 300 WN7 arty players are? Did you even read what you wrote?\n\n&gt;I consistently see 45% 300 WN7 tanks do very little damage and just suicide 2 mins into the game.\nI consistently see Unicum tanks do a fantastic amount of damage and kills.\n\nYeah, that's WoT for you. \n\n&gt;Most of the time when I'm moving around in my Centurion and there's a bloody E-100 and T95 right close to me and I get blapped for 1500 or so and get an engine fire and damaged ammo rack if I don't out-right die, it's from a kill-hungry damage whore 45% tier X arty (if it's a tier X game anyways) who pick on large, softbodied lower tier tanks because they want the kills and damage rather than the win. I move around trying to avoid these fuckers, but there's no escape sometimes while they're sitting behind a hill across the map shooting you behind the hill you're hiding behind. High tier arty is painful due to splash-- it seems the higher you get with arty the less skill it takes for the most part. \n\nWhat I'm getting from this is that your group fucked up. You were playing a medium, rolled with a pack of huge zero camo tanks, got lit, and got blapped because you were the easiest kill. Not only is it your fault that you got fucked, but the SPG that killed you has good target selection. Centurian Mk 1's 20pdr is one of (if not the) best gun on any tier 8 medium. You can easily compete at tier ten with it. So he took that shot that would impact your group's ability to fight the most. He has no guarantees on the T95 or the E-100, but on you if he hits you're gonna have a bad time. \n\n&gt;In arty, you don't really have to know many mechanics and how to use them. You don't even have to know how HE works really. You don't have to know how camo and viewrange works or how to use terrain effectively to do well.\n\nu wot m8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378151355", "subreddit": "WorldofTanks", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The fact that news made it to number 1 on Reddit front page just tells you how big this Signing Arsenal made today.\n\nMy head is in a spin. Arsenal Fan 27 years, love the club to death, seen their vision however lost faith in Wenger and the club as each of the last 6-7 years went by.\n\nIn Wenger we trust. Simple as. The man is a Genius. He has a pair of balls the size of the Emirates Stadium . He looked every one in the eye in the last 6-7 years as things got worst and worst and did what he needed to do and not a single fook was given by him to anyone, no matter how hard he got it. \n\nI for one, will hold my hand up and say I did get tired of the same old BS of selling our best and buying unproven. Now, I feel this has paid off.\n\nArsene will surpass Ferguson as a Premier League Legend. What Arsene and Arsenal have done today is so huge. Not only has it blown my mind, it's blown the minds of the football world as a whole.\n\nI can see Arsene retiring tonight at home, ready for bed, sitting down, glasses on, relaxed with a glass of wine in his hand. He's watching sky sports, he has that grin on his face that we all know, and saying to himself, let the games begin.\n\nI truly believe this signal of intent from Arsenal is the start of things to come. Ozil is world class, 24, look at his stats. He is a wonderful, smashing footballer.\n\nAgain Arsene is a fooking Genius. We now have 3 German Internationals, 2 Spanish International's + Arteta and the English core of the squad. Yes, we are light in areas, but we'll sort it out, part of Wenger's master plan.\n\nWe wont win the league this year, Chelsea will, We'll be second or third, Man UTD will drop big time, Man City will be there or there abouts, and Spurs will be scrapping as per usual.  \n\nAs Arsenal get better and better we will attract more world class players. Arsenal are in a position to really really cement themselves into world football.\n\nI'm waffling on and on like a teenager on speed, its just that good. In 2 years time, maybe less we will win the premier league and I can't wait to see Arsene hold some more trophies like he has done with Arsenal in the past. \n\nWhat a man. Well done Arsene.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378172013", "subreddit": "soccer", "score": 42, "controversiality": 0}

Personally I have been thoroughly enjoying it, Im about 7 hours into a campaign as Athens and i'm still adjusting to the new Ui and the new campaign maps management system. \n\nI can without a doubt say that\n\n1- Graphics are incredible, a huge step up from Rome 1, this is an obvious point.\n\n2- The actual unit management on the battle map along with significantly improved fighting animations make you want to just zoom in and watch a fight unfold at times. More unit specific abilities add to the game, making you think strategically about when to use them rather than just charging the enemy.\n\n3- The traits and abilities system in place for both individual generals and armies really can make each of your generals and armies feel unique and different, and in the case of generals keep them alive to make use of the traits and retinues they have acquired. To expand on this i currently have 2 large full stack armies one i use to defend my borders that have increased defensive bonuses and defensive equipment such as barricades and fire pits. And I also have a very powerful and experienced army that i use for conquering new settlements whose name is 'FOOKIN PRAWNS' ( guess what film i watched yesterday) they specialise in siege warfare and there abilities reflect that, allowing them to build greater war machines for siege battles.\n\n4- Some great music especially the menu screens some pieces very reminiscent of Gladiator- although so far the music doesn't come close to the epicness of Rome 1.\n\n5- The auto resolve feature is drastically improved and takes into account a bunch of factors such as unit experience and whether you are sieging or defending a settlement can really change the outcome. \n\n6- The garrison system triumphs over Rome 1's tediousness of having to constantly place stacks on border settlements and spawn town watch on low happiness settlements. Now when commissioning buildings you will notice certain ones will add garrison units, a settlement with lots of military buildings such as barracks can have around 15 or so garrisoned units not to mention maritime settlements having access to naval garrisons.\n\n7- Smooth gameplay on ultra with frame rate dipping below 30's when zoomed in on very hectic battles, i'd guess I'm averaging around 50 fps most of the time.\n\n8- Tech trees really make you choose between having strong units available to you at the start and having a weaker economy, an vice versa. Again they can change the way you play the game\nOnto the bad\n\n1- some quite game ruining bugs and graphical hiccups. This is only release day so i expect all this issues to be solved in a few weeks but a the moment many people are having terrible graphical issues and game breaking bugs stopping them from progressing. I myself am lucky to only have experienced some minor campaign map lag running a i5 3575k ( something along those lines) with 8gb of RAM a gtx 570 and windows \n\n2- Completely broken diplomacy, out of the 20 or so factions i have encountered through exploration and my one ally Egypt some 12 factions have declared war against me and none are accepting of my trade and other agreements even when they are friendly towards me. Back to Egypt these guys are on something because in the space of 15 turns they declared war on 10 factions the majority of which were the other side of ocean to them and caused no immediate danger.\n\n3- The campaign map part of the game seems very dumbed down, there are no longer individual scrolls with in depth details about population happiness and growth, you have to settle for hovering your mouse of a box which gives you just a number and simple information.\n\n4- Haven't checked if you can disable watching ai movement but with  a hundred or so factions 30 turns in I could be waiting 2 minutes for the ai to be done pissing about.\n\n5- Ai doesn't seem to be as smart as we were promised. For instance they can be downright stupid at times, attacking a 20 stack city with one unit, this occurred twice in half an hour for me, constant use of a single ship to blockade a port, only to be instantly destroyed. Standing about doing nothing, being Athens I expected at the very least to see a roman invasion. Rome declares war on me 13 turns in, 30 or so turns later i have only seen them standing about with several 1-2 stacks of men at brundisium.\nWhen being besieged by the AI they seem to just come in a huge blob, not even attempting to encircle the city, or attack from multiple points.\n\n6- Some poor animation, the big one I have noticed is  that cavalry charges just seem to run into men or alongside them, very few attempt to actually use there weapons. It may be a design decision but when using units such as phalanx pikemen they start without pikes, pressing the phalanx button will have them pull 18 foot long pikes out of nowhere.\nAlso for every 1 soldier performing cool animations and trying to kill the enemy there are 5 standing there just holding their shields.\n\n7- I assume this will be fixes at some point but in my experience after obtaining a stack of 20 units of 3 bronze to 3 silver experience i can steamroll navies and armies, even defenders who have 2000 men and 2000 reinforcements i can beat with only 2000 men, sometimes i only lose 3 percent of my men which is ridiculous.\n\nThats all i can think of for now, iv'e probably missed a lot, overall though Rome 2 is shaping up to be a very good game with some inherent flaws and issues that need sorting but its too early to tell if it will be seen as a worthy successor to Rome 1.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378250766", "subreddit": "totalwar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I just wonder if some hybridization of the two would be possible or desirable. Facebook and others have both a public and private interface;\n\nWell OKC had/has forums you just have to search for them.  \n  \n&gt;Dating site profiles, comparatively, are like looking at pieces of paper in a 3 ring binder.  \n  \nI feel so much of this. But, I'm not going to go ahead and start my own dating site to fix the problem.  \n  \n&gt;Perhaps reducing the user base to the local level for a more interactive feature would result in too few people to sustain much conversationally.  \n  \nI could certainly see it working out that way. But, I also agree limiting any kind of interactive function to the local level kinds of reduces the overall value of having it. What if you're that person who's priorities are in opposition to that of your local culture. Believe it or not, NY is not a green state for me match-wise, yet I live here. And for all it's population I keep hearing people saying \"But, you live in NY! You have so many people to choose from!\" Yeah. But, I am only compatible with a very small number of them. And attracted to even fewer. I think communication should always be global. But, that's a philosophy thing. Some people really want someone to get a cup of coffee with immediately and not via google hangout.  \n  \n&gt;Maybe they just are apples and oranges.  \n  \nI don't think this is intentional really. I think it's just a hangover from Facebook peaking post-Cupid advent. Our expectations for social networking are different now. Then again as someone who started posting on messageboards as a kid in the 90's my expectations for communication don't even include photos. So, I think there's a bit of that going on too. You have different waves of internet users with differing levels of involvement and expectations. I like the idea of being able to textually get to know someone. Some people who cupe are just kind of in it strictly for the dating in the face-to-face world and have never written more about themselves than a couple mandatory paragraphs for grade school.  \n  \nI have trouble relating to the cupid experience of those individuals for obvious reasons. *\"Why is everyone on okcupid so fookin' weird?\"* And the only answer is: It's the internet. What were you expecting? I am sorry you discovered this thing thanks to myspace and facebook. Please turn around and go home now.

{"body": "**War, war never changes...**\n\n(Several spoilers for the War of the River Kingdoms module)\n\nWe had been invited to the local River Kingdom games by King Irovetti. We weren't sure about this guy and things were a bit weird back home. But we had to do our diplomatic duty. Instead of finding some local champions, we entered ourselves into the games. Rainor absolutely scooped the archery contest (despite some other the others cheating with modified arrows). Lord Jope won the wood-chopping contest with some sneaky assistance from Switch (which we only agreed to when tiny little Elf maidens competed by turning into a storm giant).\n\nOff to the side, we had to deliver the giant's totem to a collector, as part of our geas. The collector had to check it first and would then give us some Macguffin as the finale for Switch's resurrection. We were okay with that, because we were doing well at the Games.\n\nAt the grand banquet, we were going to bring up the cheating in the archery contest. King Irovetti mentioned dramatically that there'd been cheating in the archery contest. Then they blamed Rainor! They effectively took away all our gold medals, upsetting us greatly. AND then they accused us of murdering the collector (which we didn't - he opened the totem somehow and got murdered, maybe even by Irovetti himself).\n\nWe accepted arrest and were escorted to a manor in the countryside. After a long wait, a group of 10 men with swords barged in and tried to kill us. Despite being unarmoured and weaponless, we killed them and escaped. (Quick brag aside: Rainor took one half of the dudes himself without taking a single hit. My Monk skills had me far ahead of the AC curve :) )\n\nWhen we snuck back to the Games, it was being dismantled. Our entourage had been killed or scattered to the winds. We had gotten a message from back home: \"We're under attack!\"\n\nGiants had been attacking our capital city, and armies were sweeping eastwards through our cities. After a daring raid to recover all our gear from an Oni general (including some of our minor artifact weapons), we returned to the capital city to fight back the giants tearing it apart. It was getting pretty dire, so several desperate plans were formulated. Rainor had found their main camp (which had been mostly unguarded). We had an opening to poisoning them and sabotaging their camp, but decided against it. We are nice guys after all, and needed a decisive victory. In the end we went with our standard plan: HALO drop onto the head giant and unleash hell and GTFO out.\n\nThe war dragged on for many months, draining our coffers and demoralizing our people. Meanwhile, Morgana had said she had a plan. She required some money and no interruptions. Morgana was famous for melting the eyeballs of bandits back in the day, and our group had markedly improved its behaviour after she'd retired from adventuring.\n\nWe pushed the fight back to Irovetti. Our armies were mostly improvised from our populace and we were running low. Then Morgana sent us a present. It was a little parcel with \"Point this side at enemy\". We were really worried about it, so kept it in reserve.\n\nAfter the world's worst infiltration attempt, we raided Irovetti's home. We'd been hamstrung by some cheeky guards with almost an unlimited amount of Sonic Bursts and total cover. The raid on the throne room had gone terribly. The King and Paladin were caught in a Force Cage (they got out with a cunning use of a large bag of holding). Rainor had been entrusted with the Weapon of Mass Destruction, mostly because no-one trusted the slightly evil Switch. But they had been overwhelmed. We were deeply wounded and totally defeated by a tricksy magic guard. Rainor fell paralyzed. Switch decided to change the tide of battle and opened the parcel...\n\nWhat came out was a lithe, adamantine, dual-wielding golem. It slaughtered the mooks. In one slick move it'd split a mook in two, and draw a portal with the blood. Out came a demon that joined the fray. Irovetti saw that the jig was up and fled. We tried to order the golem to follow us. It responded something along the lines of \"Whatever\" and jumped through the ceiling and out into the war raging outside.\n\nWe killed Irovetti and came outside to see how the war was going. It was going bad. *Really bad*. Basically this golem was an unstoppable avatar of the god of war. People on both sides were being murdered by the avatar and packs of demons. The countryside had turned into almost literally hell. Long story short, our Paladin (Klael) sacrificed himself in an epic battle to destroy most of the demons, and we destroyed the avatar. For DMs the Avatar was the unholy combination of [Ovirnbaane](/spoiler), a suit of [Demon Armour](/spoiler) and the [Eye of Vordakai](/spoiler). Yeah...\n\nHistory is written by the victors, so to soften the blow on the Freedonians we blamed Irovetti for the Avatar war crime. In a sense he was responsible for the whole war and made us use this monstrosity but it wasn't a proud moment.\n\n(EDIT: Fixed spoiler tags)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378542532", "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

And you guys kinda did burn down half a dozen buildings I built, fuck up the sheep farms I made (which BY THE WAY TOOK FUCKING FOREVER TO ORGANIZE), steal a bunch of my shit\n\nThe reason that there hasn't been any profane replies (sans one particularly angry child) is because a good portion of the players on this server are mature. The sheep was an afterthought as we made our escape. They were in rather tight quarters, and being that I'm against animal cruelty, I decided that the sheep should be set free, which served a dual purpose: freedom for our wooly friends, and wandering wayfarers would have a better shot at sleeping in a warm bed.\n\n&gt;and worst of all... manage to do all that without giving me the dignity it was done by someone with two gad dang brain cells to smash together.\n\nDo you really think we lack 'two gad dang brain cells'? Honestly?\n\n&gt;So then, you were just looking for resources? I guess that explains why you burnt down all those buildings with no fucking chests in them. \n\nActually, we burnt down every building. We did not discriminate against any buildings that were below the poverty line. If it ignites, we lights.\n\n&gt;And that 'we were just making the looting clear for other scrappers' shite? You couldn't summon enough brainpower to think of another option?

Oh, oh wait.\n\nI'm not really keen on the dialect you're speaking, so I'll just guess that 'shite' means stuff and 'arsed' means asked. As for the sign bit, I left two signs. I'll let you try and find them. Scavenger Hunt, GO!\n\n\n&gt;(Holy mother of god. If you truly must make some excuses to your idiocy, could you at least try to make something better than this pitiful BS. I mean, really, iprizefighter? Really?)\n\nWhat about our actions would you deem idiotic? We were actually very methodic in our pillaging. You should find unlocked, unreinforced chests in each of your homes full of loot we couldn't carry or didn't need.\n\n&gt;Jesus Christ, what passes for gerfers theses days... It's just damn shameful. Back in my day they'd at least make a burning swastika or two...\n\nAre you claiming to have a griefing past? Then you should be much more sympathetic to our predicament. Additionally, judging by your quick temper and vocabulary, I'm going to guess 'back in your day' was age 9? 10?\n\n&gt;Of course, as the residents of NDZ have made it ever so slightly clear that, yes, WE FRIGGING EXIST, you may find it reasonable to give us back all the resources you stole? \n\nQuite reasonable. Not once has a citizen asked for this.\n\n&gt;Of course, your wanton destruction is another thing. I'd imagine that you guys would be adverse to rebuilding NDZ\n\nNot a soul asked for this either. this resolution sounds like the most fun. I enjoy a good team-building exercise, and it would give us a chance to bond and become friends.\n\n&gt;so perhaps you should look for other forms of reparations.

No clue what has happened.\n\nAnyhow, it actually works now. Settings are on 1920x1080 (recommended) but what has happened now is that the image is like.. one inch or so too big for the screen. I.. I basically can't see the taskbar.\n\nIt goes fine when I slip the resolution (much more options now) down to the next level, which is 1776x1000.

My mum is from Liverpool and we grew up being exposed to a little bit of football, usually Liverpool. My real interest sparked with the 2005 Champions League final, watching Liverpool play to come back from 3-0 down to winning. Alonsos goal was one of the greatest things I've seen, not for the quality of the goal but just for the implications behind it. To this day Xabi Alonso is one of my favourite players of all tim. From then on I was a big fan of Liverpool.\n\nNow you are wondering \"WTF He has a Spurs crest?\" The reason behind that was when I was about 9, I had FIFA 06 on my GBA. When it said \"Select favourite team\" I saw a team called Tottenham Hotspur. I thought to myself \"They have a funny name, I'm gonna make them my team for jokes\" I ended up watching a few Tottenham games, ended up watching more Tottenham games then Liverpool games. So while I do support Tottenham and they are my team, Liverpool are, and will always be true to my heart.\n\ni luv u u fookin scousers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379161353", "subreddit": "soccer", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Background:  I went to Europe as a soldier at the age of 19-20.  Time of peace, pre 9/11, Kosovo was our only conflict and it was pretty new.\n\nI LOVED that locals (Deutschlanders) would correct my German and ask me if I speak English.  They were very, very tolerant of my \"Deutschlish\" because I was at least trying to speak the local language.\n\nNo open tables at the restaurant?  No problem.  Just sit next to this group at the big table that has a couple open chairs.  Nobody is strangers here, we came to eat, drink, and be friendly.\n\nWait a minute... girls like to do the sex, too?  (I was 19, and a virgin when I arrived, but not when I left)  Seriously, it was about as laid back as smoking a joint here in the states - \"are you cool?\" \"yeah, you?\" \"I'm cool too.\" \"yeah?:)\" \"ja.\"  \"Oh-right.  Giggity.\"  and then you kiss.\n\nPeople weren't assholes over every little thing.  If there was a fight, it was no-weapons, no-teams vs 1, it's done in a minute or two.  No need to hurt each other or involve the constabulary over fisticuffs.\n\nNot culture shock, but I'll be damned if Southern Germany doesn't look EXACTLY like Tennessee with castles.  The weather was about the same, too.\n\nOh yeah!  Meeting people on a regular basis who were not from the country I'm in.  I had acquaintances from all over Europe, even tho I seldom left my town.  Amir was the coolest cabbie ever; I hope he's still doing well after the renewed middle-east conflicts.\n\nTL;DR:  It was WAY laid back compared to my upbringing, even though I was somewhat restricted as a soldier.  I kinda wish I'd stayed, if that was an option, but hindsight is 20/20.\n\n\nEDIT:  The thing about fighting is a HUGE generalization.  I never got into any fights, and had great times with Scots (who always threatened \"Ah'll fookin hammer ye\"), but a friend of mine got mugged by Turks.  There was a big thing about Turks hating soldiers then.  Something about virgins and sisters, I think.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379533192", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As an older student let me offer you my advice.  My path to college was a delayed because I joined the military out of high school.  I was an AP student in high school who found the material exceptionally boring and not at all challenging but fortunately, I had a mom who knew I was immature and and well...lazy.   I would have been in your very shoes had I gone straight to university.  \n\nI'm not suggesting that you drop college and find yourself then try again.  What I am suggesting is that you skip that part, and become a student of this University and not a kid at the University.\n\nI'm sure our classmates in this reddit will offer you advice on how to study and what not.  I'm just going to lay down the facts.\n\n* High school was a sham.  You probably were in the top 5% of your graduating class which means you are at the peak of the bell curve on campus.  You are no longer special.  Get used to it.  It's called being an adult where being truly special and separate doesn't happen in the real world.  Seek help from classmates, GTA's, and professors when you don't understand material.\n\n* Read the fucking material.  It's where the test material hides. Also, if you are a STEM major, find related material in published literature.  You have enviable access to every published research journal that is worth noting.  You will likely never have such access again after you graduate.  Use it.  \n\n* Realize you are a rookie.  You don't have the wisdom of figuring out which classes you can blow off as easy - they are all hard.  I had one class , in my core requirements that will probably hold me back from graduating next spring  *Summa cum laude* because I assumed it was easy.  Don't do that.  \n\n* Obsess over the material.  \n\n*  Get a study partner.  Here's where my advice will differ from everyone else.  Find a study partner who is not as smart as you.  That forces you to not only go over the material, but drag them along as well - reinforcing the material for yourself.  There are still kids on the campus who will breeze through these first year courses - worst choice to study with.  They depend on eidetic memories and naturally create mnemonics to recall the material.  Everyone else who struggles actually has to learn the shit.  \n\nAfter all that, congratulations.  You are a smart student, and you recognized you had a problem before it was too late.  So many don't.  The biggest thing is, is get the fooking material you need for class and use it.  At the end of the day, college is not hard.   It is difficult because when you are supposed to go (age wise) is the most confusing and terrifically stupid part of your life.  I'm old and married.  I understand I have it easy, I'm not trying to study while being seduced by the siren call of sex, drugs, rock-n-roll, and 18 hour sleep marathons.  I did that shit years ago.  You have the complicated task of overcoming that or losing your scholarship.  Don't lose that.  Please.  \n\nLastly, /r/capstone should be more than a blogroll of Alabama politics.  It should be a place of help and academic discussions.  Ask for help on problems here, we're not all Poli-Sci majors and Machine bashers.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379679521", "subreddit": "capstone", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}
