{"body": "&gt; Fatphobia in so many ways is about hating and policing women and our bodies,\n\nIgnoring fat men are often treated badly as well, because they're fat. +5 for Misandry I guess. This is going to be Misandry heavy if you haven't guessed from the title. \n\n&gt; the fatphobia that fat men experience is also a result of misogyny.\n\nFat men are treated badly because people hate women. Got you. Wait, no, I haven't got it, that can has flown the fuck off. You could've blamed the Patriarchy if you liked, and then you'd have only seemed like an idiot, and not someone who is both an idiot and likes to redefine words to what ever they mean. +10 for \"Words are what I went them to be\", and not using a dictionary. \n\n&gt; In researching for this article, I found that fat men are often perceived as feminine.\n\n&gt; Fat men are often perceived as possessing “looser morals” or less discipline, traits historically ascribed to women and femininity.\n\nThis is the first I've heard. And here I was thinking fat men were just perceived as fat, and potentially greedy, and frequently lazy. +5 for making up stereotypes. As for the whole looser morals thing regarding women, again, wut. Again, this is the first I've heard - Islamic cultures hide women because *men* cannot be trusted around women, and to mitigate the risk of a mans instincts running amok over his morals, not the other way around. Another +5 for making up stereotypes. Please tell me if I'm wrong here, but this is the first I've heard. \n\n&gt; I also found many themes that pointed to fatphobia toward men, at its roots, being about anxiety that men were becoming woman-like.\n\nI blame the moobs, personally. \n\n&gt; 1. Chemical Feminization\n\nThe body's natural balance of chemicals, by and large, should be maintained, rather than altered. To quote something else, \"Chronic health conditions are more likely to occur in men as a result of estrogen levels becoming too high.\". It's not a hatred of women, or of men becoming feminine, it's a fucking health concern. +15 for False claims of Misogyny. \n\n&gt; I’m in the minority of scholars who argue that this kind of “hormonal determinism” is problematic, if not entirely wrong.\n\nTo quote Dalsgaard, biology don't real. The word problematic. +5 for Problematic, as it is an SJW line, and +10 for It don't real.\n\n&gt; Though the facts are correlated, it doesn’t mean that one causes the other.\n\nCan you prove they are making assumptions based on correlation? Can you prove there is no causation? Frankly, you're just saying it. We all know full well that Estrogen and Testosterone are more highly linked with the reproductive systems their commonly associated genders possess, do you really think it's that far fetched it may effect sex? \n\n&gt; Because fat people have been taught that our bodies are wrong and unattractive, I’ve found that self-consciousness can be a major factor in achieving orgasm during sex.\n\n\"My experience trumps your research\" +15.\n\n&gt; I don’t see the potentially increased presence of hormones in my body affecting my orgasm as much as I see self-awareness around my fat body affecting my orgasm.\n\nThe Salon Article didn't reference women. It referenced men. The research did not mention women, it mentioned men. Are you a man? No. You're not. Believe it or not, men and women have biological differences. \n\n&gt; I think this is an important potential confounding factor.\n\nYour experience means shit. The study was about the time men take to orgasm, not women. +15 for \"What about ME?!\" (Heck, the entire article is \"I don't agree! I think my body's different!\")\n\n&gt; The idea that men’s bodies appear “less masculine” the fatter they are has nothing to do with science (or hormones), and everything to do with the author’s fat-negative bias.\n\nTell that to all the people on Hormone Therapy that they are not going to look like the opposite sex. I mean, come on. Are you fucking retarded? The difference between the male and female gender starts to become most evident when they reach puberty for Christ's sake. +25 Science Don't Real.\n\n&gt; It literally represents the idea that fat men cannot find their penis (a level of condescension typically reserved only for women, by the way) or that they haven’t seen their penis in years, or are otherwise metaphorically castrated by their fat:\n\nWut. The joke refers to the folds of fat making it impossible to see their penis that hides in the shadow of those folds. \n\n&gt; First, the idea that a fat man cannot find his penis is infantilizing.\nAs I mentioned earlier, generally condescension of this kind is reserved for women, who are constructed culturally as child-like as and less intelligent than men.\n\nOf course it can't be offensive to men, it must be offensive to women. +15 \"This is a Feminist issue\" when it's about men. If you're looking at undertones you're missing the fucking point. Anyone can look at a silhouette and get something different out of it, that's why we look at the surface. \n\n&gt; This meme reminded me of the way that sometimes men talk to me in a baby voice when they think I don’t understand something that they believe to be self-evident.\n\nBeing condescending is not specific to gender. Women do it, men do it, it happens to women, it happens to men. +15 \"Feminist\" issue. \n\n&gt; Second, this “missing penis” represents cultural anxiety about sexual differentiation.\n\nYadde-yadde, no. It's mocking fat people. It's not about sex, it's not about gender. +15 \"Feminist\" issue. \n\n&gt; 3. “Moob” Development\n\n&gt; Another source of anxiety expressed toward fat men’s bodies is the development of breasts, otherwise known as the shame-inducing neologism “moobs” or “man boobs.”\n\nUnlike a woman's breasts, moobs are not attractive, they are certainly not a quality women look for in a potential mate, just like monobrows are not, and roll upon roll of fat.\n\n&gt; As a man, you should be attracted to them, and if you have “moobs,” then you are confusing heteronormativity\n\nu wot m8. u avin a giggle. It's because moobs, regardless of who they're on look disgusting. They do not look like women's breasts, they look like giant mounds of 'not-healthy' sprouting out of your chest. +10 for It's the Patriaaaaarchy!\n\n&gt; Blurring the lines between men and women's bodies.\n\nNo, it really doesn't. Look at a fat man, now look at a fat woman. They look very different, there is no confusion.\n\n&gt; Truth: All humans have breasts!\n\nIndeed, they do. But the breasts of the male human being are not intended to be that large. +15 for Irrelevant Facts. We can also get breast cancer, but I don't see you claiming that the Breast Cancer Foundation's Pink Ribbon is a Masculism or Men's Rights issue.\n\n&gt; However, I certainly feel that sexism is a major factor in the ways that fat men are rhetoricized online.\n\nYou were saying misogyny was earlier, so I'll just pretend you said that. That is blaming men for men being shamed for being fat. That is victim blaming, +5. If you genuinely think the perception of fat people is a problem, then don't sell it as Feminism. Feminists won't stop supporting, just because you're not blaming men, or at least the good kind of Feminist won't, and men might be more encouraged to join a movement that doesn't blame them for every fucking evil in the history of the human race. \n\n&gt; Rhetoricized online\n\nEveryone is. Nerds are, despite the internet being a place built on technology. \n\n&gt; not to deny male privilege (which fat men do possess)\n\nFat men are being ostracized for becoming like women, but fat men have male privilege? Fuck off, one or the other. +20 for not seeing how this contradicts what you said earlier, and for blaming men for everything under the sun. Fatphobia, if you accept it, is a fear of unhealthy people created by society, women are incredibly capable of influencing opinion and perception, as are men, the only difference is, until somewhat recently women had no political power. Women could still talk to their children, and mold them to hate fat people, women could still talk to their friends and family and subtly influence the disapproval of fatness we see today, but don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming women, I'm blaming everyone. \n\nTotal is 205, wow, second best.

You really get to interact with them and they treat you differently than the other customers would.  \n\nAlthough, I can't ever remember our regulars bringing us food during the holidays; however I do remember one hambeast sized family that would always eat at CiCi's pizza next door before coming over to get movies every Sunday.  The family walks in like they do every sunday, they start at the new release wall, work their way around, and then moving across the older movies in the center before finally coming to rest at the counter.  Did you find everything ok today?\n\nThe hamhoard pay for their shit and go to walk out.  As fate would have it, the hambeast daughter doubles over and begins to fucking puke all over the front entrance.  To this day, I swear, the amount of vomit that came out of girl she must have had two stomachs.  Without hesitation I let out a clear and audible \"Fuck.\"  It was early Sunday, I was the opening manager, and I was alone for several hours.  The hamhoard don't say a word to me they just take their shit and walk out.  I'm left standing there like U WOT M8!  Motherfuckers didn't even say \"ahhhhh damn sorry about that.\"  The phrase, \"what can I do to help\" would also have been accepted.  Fucking hamhoard just went out the door and I never **EVER** saw them again on a Sunday morning.  If I ever did see them again I was going to make sure to ask them, \"ya'll gonna keep it together today?\"\n\nI call the store manager to ask for permission to open both front doors to evac the smell.  I get the ok, prop open the doors, drop down a piso mojado by the puke, and run to get a bucket.  I ended up cleaning that shit up by myself.  I was pissed man.....so pissed.  Got it all cleaned up and left the front doors open all day because it was nice outside.\n\nNothing better than regular customers man.  **THAT'S** where it's at.

{"body": "Because the clans you need to join in the progression change frequently. A few months ago you joined RDDT7 at tier 6 and did Companies. When you got a Tier X and you were gud enuf you'd get a recommendation to join the CW training clan which was RDDT4 at the time (I think). Then you'd get trained in the ways of CW and when you met the tank requirements for NARWL and you were gud enuf you could skirt the stat requirements and join. If you were considered \"talent\" in NARWL you'd be eaten up by RDDT. \n\nThen the whole idea of a \"training clan\" was nuked and RDDT4 became a pawn CW clan for RDDT and NARWL (defend muh landing) with no more (at least public) teaching objective.\n\nNext two pure social clans were turned into TC clans and the TC clan (RDDT7) was changed into a social clan. A very \"u wot m8\" move, moving clan members around in already fat clans instead of just making leadership changes (RDDT7 had potato leadership at the time anyway). But whatever. \n\nLastly we got the \"CW training clan\" back, but only in label. Why? Because the new RDDT5 with yellow stat leadership is expected to teach bads how to CW. Even worse most of them feel that RDDT5 is another pawn clan in the same way that RDDT4 has been since they got \"bumped\". Most of RDDT5 doesn't even know if they'll be a CW relevant clan tomorrow, let alone in a few months. Sure RDDT5 recruitment is going to spike because it's now a \"CW training clan\" but I am not at all confident in its ability to teach players and execute the clan wars it will be expected to.

George Graham was the boss, he was cool, tough, took no shit, was a defensive genius and won us a fair few trophies to include that memorable win at Anfield in 1989.\n\nIn around or around the cup double winning team things went a bit sour. Arsenal did not capitalize on winning the league in the 91 / 92 season, Graham bought sub standard players, Chris Kimowma (Spelling), John Jensen ect, pretty rubbish players and we lost some ground.\n\nIt all went south when it emerged that Paul Merson was a drunk, a coke head and a gambler. Not long after that, George Graham was changed with taking a bung in the transfer of John Jensen. He took 500k as part of the transfer deal to take John Jensen to Arsenal. It made sense and John Jensen was shit, one goal, a cracker against QPR in I dont know how may appearances.  \n\nOnce Graham left and Merson in Rehab, not forgetting Tony Adam's drinking problems which landed him in Jail, Arsenal went to the shits. Stewart Housten took over as caretaker and was rubbish. Then we got Bruce Rioch from Bolton, fucking rubbish again, but he did sign David Platt and the wonderful dennis bergkamp.\n\nWe struggled and Bruce Rioch was sacked, and Stewart Housten took over as care taker again.\n\nI remember being up the fooking walls, with the team. We went from being great, winning cups, euro cups, beating Liverpool and Man U to the league title. \n\nAll of a sudden, David Dein mentions a French Guy called Arsene Wenger. I and a lot of fans were like who? \n\nI remember his first game in charge, Arsene brought Patrick Veria with him when he joined. I think we were playing Sheffield Wednesday, mid-week game, the fans were very excited about Arsene and this Patick Veria guy. Paddy came on as a sub, Arsene bought him on. As soon as Paddy won the ball in Mid-Field and played a 60 yard curling pass out to the left hand side, I knew we were onto something special.\n\nArsenal is my life, been though some ups and downs over 26 years or so but I fooking love them, no matter what!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383843486", "subreddit": "Gunners", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

I for one LOVE Opeth, but I definitely see where you are coming from. I'm not sure how well versed you are in the prog genre, but some people enjoy repetitive, drawn out things (if done well). That's not saying I agree with you when you say their music is a formulaic composition though. Their sound is their sound. They do mash metal with folk and acoustic a lot but each album feels like they do it a different way with a different sound. I HATED Opeth when I first listened to them because I thought what you thought, but over time it started growing on me. I'm not saying you didn't listen to it enough. And, when you deal with metal heads, there is always fucking elitism, they're just ass hats when it comes to uncommon interest within the metal genre.\n\nI will say this. The solos from deliverance, damnation, and ghost reveries do get stale and seem very close to the same thing.\n\nEdit: Your logic and reasoning isn't flawed, I just disagree.

Like, a massive trench system on some unidentified beachead.\n* Oh, don't forget, someone forgot to tell the surveying team that putting your command station for *all of your drones* on the front line (At the very end of the trenches, towards the enemy attack zone) is a bad idea.\n* Two people survive a direct hit from a tungsten-rod orbital bombardment.

Cheers! \n\n&gt;**Petty Scientific Insults**\nPretty big talk for a guy who avoided the question entirely about why neoteny would be important or evolve in salamanders.\n\nOh, well usually neoteny in caudates is a response to terrestrial environmental conditions.

Speaking of salamanders, I found this red eft in the woods near me that you might enjoy!  [Sorry for the blurry photo, it was on my phone!](http://i.imgur.com/60BzXIk.jpg)\n\nRed efts are freaking awesome. Incredibly poisonous as well.

{"body": "I know where you're coming from, and I'm seeing a lot of people agreeing, making my opinion potentially unpopular, but I disagree. It's kind of long, nothing is meant personally, and if you disagree, I'd love to hear your bit (or anyone else's).  \n\nI'm a Japanese who has lived in America and Japan, and I've gone through probably what you're talking about, and also what the article is talking about. Yours is, like you said below in your response to madazzahatter, a passive giving up of things. A general nonchalance to language and heritage, not because it's holding you down, but because you don't need it. Language practice without application is simply a chore, something you don't need in busy teenage years. Understanding your parents' culture doesn't raise your grades, nor does it get you friends. I find the situation less about \"fitting in\" and more about \"fuck, who cares\". When you do speak, language is useful to communicating with your fellow Asians, feeling that deep cultural connection, like a bro code or secret handshake: not necessary, but hella awesome and empowering. (On a side note, I find the adolescent Asian-American community unique in that way: you have people who claim to love their heritage, like a status, yet a majority who do not really actively care for understanding what it is, beyond fulfilling stereotypes and claiming \"I'm so Asian\": go to language school, get good grades, play an instrument, be a rice aficionado and such. At least I was of this moderately superficial type. I've grown to see that it takes a lot more effort.)  \n\nTo me, what the article is dealing with is more an active issue. It is regarding a more conscious decision to give up a language/culture, not that you don't care for it, but because it is seriously (or so you feel) holding you back. It is a lot more aggressive, and more uncomfortable than anything I've experienced in the US.  \n\nRanting a bit:  \nJapanese guy fluent in English living in Japan, ever find yourself making your English sound fucked up so people wouldn't stare at you for your perfect pronunciation? \"Ai laiku wottching basebooru (?)\", yeah that shit. That happening in conversation is fine, maybe they can't pick up the words if it's fast. The fact that they give you that shit in English class is just stupid. You ever criticize a Mexican for speaking good Spanish in Spanish class? \"Your Spanish is sweet, but you sound so fucked up hahaha.\" Yeah, I don't think so. That's just for pronunciation, try something more cultural and less understood. Just try a public \"Love you sweety\" from a parent, like they do in TV shows, and shit-head adolescent heynas will eat you alive with ridicule. It's not ahh, I've got different parents, nonono, it's fuck, why'd I have to be different. When you have to regret how you grew up, something's fuck wrong.  \n\nI've talked to enough people in similar situations to know that I am not an outlier. Especially fucking up how you speak, because that is really embarrassing. And that's for someone who can hide under his Japanese guise, halfs and foreigners probably have different troubles. But sometimes I do envy gaikokujin (foreigners) who are obviously gaikokujin: it is acceptable for them to act like foreigners, because they are foreigners, and you'd be a dick for harassing them about that (there's peer pressure for that too). I'm Japanese, so I need to know how to act and speak politely in Japanese. I've more than once fucked the discussion because I didn't know some stupid geinoujin in discussion. Even smaller details can create a wall: I've more than once been told that my chopstick holding was wrong, and that my parents may have fucked up my early education (thanks for that heads up). Easiest way is to fuck up a Japanese phrase early on in a conversation and they'll treat you like a retard for the rest of the day, and possibly for the rest of your acquaintance if that becomes your social position.  \n\nBullying would make things worse, but it really doesn't always have a direct correlation. It's also a more complex problem than simple racism. I think racism in Japan has a disproportionate representation on the internet: it is unaccepted beyond doubt. You say your zainichi shit in public, that is social suicide. If it wasn't, the assholes parading wouldn't be wearing masks (not to say there aren't racial political problems, but you won't hear crap outside the internet and in really small racist groups which are prevalent in any country). Plus, standing out as a racist in public really makes you a prime target for the bullying you're trying to incite. Racism and bullying may be the problem in some really shitty cases, but it is usually more of a build up of small case-by-case situations. That odd giggle. That roll of eyes. That not being taken seriously. That humiliation. It's not the fact that you're bilingual in and of itself, but the odd things that occur because you're a bilingual that leads you to feel ostracized.  \n\nI have regretted at some point in my adolescent life, not having grown up in Japan. I've never had that feeling in the US, regretting my Japanese ancestory, and I don't think a lot of people will, not to a really serious degree. Of course I don't anymore, because I've probably found a good balance of being a weirdo with a strange background, and knowing when to \"read the air\", or so they say. And I've only pointed out the shitty points. Being bilingual is awesome for me 99% of the time, and Japanese people are awesome in general. The 1%? I wish I could still listen to corny Jpop English parts without realizing how stupid the lyrics are.  \n\nOne last note, especially to 2nd generation Americans: spend time sometime in your life to understand your parents' language, and visit your nation of heritage. The greatest thing about this is that you'll get to know your parents from a different angle, probably a better one. For me, it was like looking at a solution manual: their way of thinking, their behavior, that odd logic, everything made so much more sense. You'll be able to have a lot deeper conversations with them, which mean cooler stories. My parents really gained another dimension for me once I learned Japanese. I'd never realized that they were such deep thinking people, and so awesomely intelligent. I mean, they have to be, considering they braved a journey into a new land, making sense of everything and even raising a family.

{"body": "Sure. Go to big threads, look for cirklejerky comments that have high karma. Remember them. Now all you need to do is make the same comments in different threads when you think that they are appropriate. I don't what's hip and cool anymore when it comes to cirklejerking, since I unsubbed from those cancerous subs a long time ago, but I'll give you some examples on what worked back then.  \n1) Link to relevant subs when appropriate. Linking to subs like /r/firstworldanarchists, /r/thathappened, /r/mildyinfuriating and /r/nocontext will get you easy karma most of the time.  \n\n2) Post \"funny\" gifs and pictures (gifs work better) when relevant.  \n\n3) Actively use references to well known reddit stories and people. Including, but not limited to: the guy who banged his mom, Woody Harrelson, the cumbox, stupid longhorse, it went okay etc.  \n\n4) If you see a guy with a funny/relevant username try  to use advantage of that before anyone else does. Use either \"relevant username\" or include his username in a \"funny\" way accordingly.  \n\n5) Mention \"reddit celebreties\" when appropriate. /u/Unidad for when there's science and shit, /u/AWildSketchAppeared for teh funny drawings etc.  \n\n6) And here're some useful catchfrases that can be used in almlost any thread: risky click; u wot m8?; this; his name? Albert Einstein; wow so cirklejerk, much shibe; 3edgy5me; mom's spaghetti, why not both, can confirm.  \n\nThere's a lot more, but I couldn't be arsed.

Just repeating the content didn't seem that fun (especially since the normal group was all serious business). \n\nI can't play with people whose every other sentence is \"if you're doing less than 150k damage you're bad\".  I understand the sentiment, but I'm sure whomever is doing that knows they're screwing up and will improve. It's better to offer advice than to put-down repeatedly (for reference though, I'm a warlock. i sware on me mum, my dmg will rek ur face. 1v1 me rite now goldshire).\n\nI also can't play with the people who say really silly stupid stuff (and they admit 100% it is for \"shock value\").  I can't even remember what it was, I had to turn off vent. Something about the specifics of a trans operation works, commentary on whether his/her grandparents would accept it, etc.  A discussion is fine, but it was blatantly aggravating and bait-worthy discussion.\n\nSince then I've been leveling up a rogue on the side. Recently got to level 40. It's ... okay. The actual game play is fun. Leveling isn't too interesting because I never get to see zone quest-lines come to an end without outleveling the content severely.  5man dungeons are just romps through everything.  I think it is best to retire wow until WOD comes out.\n\nI want to hit all the challenge modes or do 3v3 pvp but my friends are rarely online. I also need to finish proving grounds endless wave 30 (I consistently fail on either wave 24 or 27, and having to restart from the beginning is tedious).\n\nSorry for the rant.

{"body": "&gt; What people say, what they do and how they speak with members of their own sex differ considerably from how they behave when the other sex is around. Maccoby threw a hand grenade into her field of developmental psychology years ago when she showed that gender differences in children couldn't be accounted for by personality traits but rather by the gender composition of a group. Little girls aren't \"passive\" as some ingrained quality, for example; they are passive only when boys are present. This approach shows why traditional efforts to measure sex differences in terms of individual traits or abilities (empathy, vanity, submissiveness, intelligence, math abilities and so forth) are fruitless and become quickly dated. Sex differences that show up in any study tend to be artifacts of education, power, the immediate social context and the historical moment, which is why they wax and wane with the times. For example, \"female intuition\" about other people is actually subordinate's intuition: both sexes are equally intuitive when they have to read a superior's mood, nonverbal signals or intentions--and equally thick-headed, when they are the bosses, about their subordinates' feelings. Maccoby sets out to explain the great mystery of gender development: the virtually universal existence of gender segregation among children, which remains impervious to the best efforts of egalitarian-minded parents and teachers. Boys and girls will play together if adults require them to, although it's often \"side-by-side\" play, in which each does his or her own thing, but given their druthers, children self-segregate. The result, Maccoby argues, is the emergence of a \"girls' culture\" and a \"boys' culture\" that are strikingly different in play styles, toy preferences and ways of interacting. \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Two-Sexes-Growing-Coming-Together/dp/0674914813\n\nSee 'brave girls, tender boys' and other feminist hijinks in sweden to reverse this 'patriarchal brainwashing' and 'traditional stereotypes', and instill their own new stereotypes.\n\n&gt;However, one place I don't believe a dominant/submissive or authoritative/subordinative dynamic should be advocated is within the context of a romantic relationship. \n\nEven feminists find themselves for non equality in bedroom, the one place where sexism is good. \n\n&gt;If romantic/sexual submissiveness is a positive trait in women (a sign of strength and trust as some say), why isn't it also a positive trait in men?\n\nWhy do you think it should be?\n\n&gt;Do you believe that women who aren't naturally submissive should engage in a d/s dynamic despite their disinclination? \n\nI believe that women who are, which is the overwhelming majority, should follow their inclination instead of living upto feminist ideals of equality and stop ruining their lives with 'personal is political'.\n\n&gt;submissiveness is a positive trait to have in certain aspects of life. Doing well in school\n\n*And what happened to this agonistic educational culture? After over two thousand years as the central element in education, public verbal contest died out almost completely in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Instead of the oral, argument-based, male-dominated education of the pre-1870 period, education post-1870 was much more interiorized, irenic, negotiative, explanatory. The older methods of academic defense and attack died out with startling rapidity, says Ong, because of the entrance of women into higher education. Contestive, combative educational methods that had worked satisfactorily for all-male schooling now came to seem violent, vulgar, silly.*\n\nhttp://unmaskingfeminism.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/the-feminization-of-rhetoric/\n\n&gt;keeping a job, \n\nindeed, that's why men like Wendell Berry wonder why is it that feminism would advocate submissiveness to an aloof boss instead to a woman's own man?\n\n&gt;Why would any woman who would refuse, properly, to take the marital vow of obedience (on the ground, presumably, that subservience to a mere human being is beneath human dignity) then regard as “liberating” a job that puts her under the authority of a boss (man or woman) whose authority specifically requires and expects obedience?\n\nhttp://www.crosscurrents.org/berryspring2003.htm\n\n&gt;staying fit\n\nhow? Submissiveness is what prevented women from becoming strong muscular amazons and instead remain contented as dainty littler flowers.\n\n&gt;raising children\n\nu wot m8?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385273665", "subreddit": "PurplePillDebate", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

Her 1's easy to dodge if you remain out of her range. This being said, she hurts melee gods. You have a point here but also do keep in mind that Hel has 6/7 skills, Chang'e has 4. \n\n3) yes, poly is a core item for **all damaging mages**, not just Chang'e. low CDs = inherit advantage for her and all low cd mages such as hebob\n\n4) u wot m8? She can buff her **physical protections** by 30 - and you should be getting pen if you're fighting Chang'e. Magical gankers have an advantage for fighting Chang'e - bait out her aegis and then kill her. Yes, she's slippery - and that's rather uncommon for a mage.\n\n5) same with a few others, what's your point here - also Hel's main damaging attributes are also hard to dodge.\n\n6) yes, her passive is very, very strong and everyone knows it but it does become useless at one point\n\n7) oh boy, melee-ranged damage on an ability that's intended to heal - this change makes no sense to me but i guess we want to hurt melee gods even more\n\nIf I had to choose Hel vs Chang'e, I'd choose Hel because I know when I'm overextending - I don't need that 2.\n\nbut i love that rabbit to death so chang'e mai waifu\n\nWhy would I choose Hel over Chang'e?

{"body": "1) Your original point: &gt;She has the most CC by far [in relation to Hel].\n\nI believe Hel, Ra and Isis can proc Polynomicon consistently before killing someone. For 30s straight though, Hel and Chang'e can proc their abilities consistently - though Chang'e only needs her 1.\n\nDoes this make her better in your eyes? Apparently. I believe that Chang'e is the only support mage that can proc Poly consistently using only 1 skill (since Hel can't proc it off of her ult and her Dark Stance bonus lets Polynomicon do 20% more damage).\n\n2) &gt;You seem to believe that it is perfectly fine for a carry to be zoned out by a support mage and that the carry is doing well by not joining a team fight\n\nu wot m8\n\nIf the carry can't push his or her way through the mage, then yes - the carry isn't doing his or her job or is out of position or there's an earlygame teamfight before 10m in.\n\n3) Out of every support mage (Ra, Isis, Aphrodite, Chang'e, Hel), Chang'e can proc Poly with her 1 if it has maximum CDR.\n\n4) Executioner's fine. 30 physical power and +20% attack speed is what I buy it for, the passive's just a way to let my other physical damage dealers get more damage in. I barely touch it since Qin's Sais exists.\n\nAlso: &gt;Penetration and protections are **less efficient in accomplishing damage/survivability the more you have.**\n\n...the fuck?\n\nEach point of protections gives +1% EHP. In case you don't understand, every point of protections increases your theoretical maximum health by one percent. Having 100 protections is a 100% maximum health \"bonus\" (but ofc you should be building power depending on class etc etc). Every point of penetration you have decreases their EHP by 1%, up to a minimum of 100% EHP remaining. This is also why Titan's Bane is really good lategame - for around 2k gold, you gain a good 80 penetration on Tanks, and at least 10 penetration on everyone else - nearly doing true damage on anyone that hasn't built protections.\n\nNow, I'm not saying you should buy 9999999999999999 points of Penetration (unless you're playing Kali, mmm dat poke) - you want a **bit of penetration along with the built in pen from Warrior Tabi**.\n\nI always buy the following regardless of carry: Warrior Tabi, Heartseeker (unless being heavily outplayed), Qin's Sais, Malice, Deathbringer, &lt;x&gt;. If Qin's didn't exist, I'd probably buy Executioner. My &lt;x&gt; is generally Titan's Bane (pseudo-true damage) or Bloodforge (item gives more physical power out of any item in the game bar Transcendence).\n\n7) Now you added context to this situation. You said the following: &lt;go to objective (team fight) - chang'e stands in your way as a carry. wat do?&gt;\n\nGo through the Chang'e/kill her. It's not that hard... If your build is maxed, you can lifesteal off of her ability damage (probably not Polynomicon).\n\n&gt;Chang'e was more useful than you in that fight because she not only did a lot of damage, she mitigated a lot, supported her team with heals/buffs, and CC'd a few members of your team for easy initiation.\n\n...I need more context than this. Are we away from the teamfight, solo laning against eachother? Are we right next to the teamfight but I'm initially being zoned?\n\nFirst scenario: we're both away from the teamfight and i'm out of position\n\nSecond scenario: not doing my job", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385394532", "subreddit": "Smite", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "“U WOT M8” is a shorthand for “You what, mate?” which is a colloquialism used by English speakers in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. It is typically used in response to an incoherent proposition put forth by someone else, along the similar lines of “what did you just say?” or wat or what is this. Alternatively, the phrase can be used devoid of any context to confuse anyone that is unfamiliar with the expression.\n\n_____________\n\nAccording to Urban Dictionary, “U WOT” is the phonetic transcription of the interjectory “you what?” used as an angry retort to a bad news. Mate, when used as a noun, is a colloquial term mainly used in the United Kingdom and Australia as a friendly form of address among men, with its earliest documentation found in a Middle English manuscript named Sir Ferumbras dating to circa 1380. Its l33t-style shorthand form “M8” has been used in IRC channels and instant messaging since the 1990s. Its online use as a shorter way of saying mate was first noted via Urban Dictionary in November 2002.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385443160", "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\nShe twitches as her knee bends and her thick, juicy thighs enter Raen’s insides, the thick, soft muscle and satin smooth skin tenderly stroking past Raen as the foot presses against Raen’s cervix, the toes twitching against it as it opens up and wraps tightly around them, gulping them up like a lamprey. Her thigh is now fully inside and her own crotch rubs up against Raen’s as she continues to finger her clit, looking down at the tortured woman as she rubs her pussy against hers. Raen then gulps up her waist, the bloody stump lubing her up nicely as Raen feels the warm blood spurt against her insides as the entrance to her moist cunt wraps tightly around her waist and stomach, constricting it like a snake as Raen quickly leans down to rip off her clothes, exposing the Asians petite, tanned body and pert little breasts with exotic dark nipples. Raen gives a cheeky little wave to her and blows a kiss as the masseur cries pathetically, her trim smooth stomach hungrily gobbled up by Raen’s voracious cunt, each ‘bite’ that it takes, leaking more of Raen’s juices over her body as it looks like it is salivating. She tries to use her frail hand to push away at Raen’s crotch, but the hands slip and her gripped in the meaty lips of Raen’s pussy. She wriggles like a worm as her stomach is fully ingested, her leg being slurped up through the tight cervical entrance causing Raen to feel intense pleasure as thicker and thicker limbs enter the impossibly tight cervix.\n\n There is a camera watching all of this happen, meant to be there for security, but now only capturing the Asians humiliation as Raen smiles to the camera uncaringly as she gets back to rubbing her engorged little clit after suckling on her fingers to make them warm wet and slick. The masseurs pert little breasts are crushed down by the slippery tight muscles, the jiggling mounds of fat pressed down tight as the nipples prod against Raen’s vaginal walls, stroking against them as they travel down. She pants heavily as she looks, the glistening moist flesh of Raen’s pussy getting closer, she whimpers and thrashes her head, looking in dismay to the camera, a tear trickling down her cheek as she feels the warmth of Raen’s pussy slide wetly over her neck, her chin, her lips. She tries to spit out the taste, the strong taste of sex that coats her lips and drips into her mouth, and then there is the heavy musky scent that is pressed up against her nose as it slides inside of Raen. Then her eyes see nothing but Raen’s quivering wall, she can hear nothing but the squelching of Raen’s pussy as the cervix wraps around her stomach causing her to howl in pain as it feels like her back is about to break. Raen can see the outline of her face through her pudenda, an open mouthed scream, the indentation of her eye sockets which Raen strokes as she is slurped up into Raen’s womb…so digestion can begin.\n\nThe Asian has a broken foot, one leg torn off and digesting above her, she can hear it gurgle away. She is wrapped up tight in the elastic womb, balled up so she can barely move, wrapped in an uncomfortable foetal position, the thick walls forming around every contour of her body, thick and almost fluffy, seeping strong musky fluids as she begs, “Please! Let me out! Please, oh god I beg you…I don’t want to be in here, it smells and tastes awful…I am in pain! Please!” Raen curls her toes as she hears her pleas, giving a rub to her womb, saying passionately, “Please…tell me more, I want to hear everything, every little feeling as I digest you into fem cum and spurt you out.” Raen’s fingers begin to schilck inside of her pussy and the Asian can hear the wet noise of Raen fingering herself as the fingers explore her pussy, she can hear the pleasure her tormentor gains and sobs quietly as it begins. The sticky smelly juices clinging to her skin, they sizzle…it feels like oil, hot boiling oil. She gives a startled kick with her broken foot, screaming as the elastic walls twist it even more, it continues, sizzling her skin, every thrash she gives causing more pain to her broken leg, some seeps into her eye and she screams, “Oh god it hurts, please, let me out, aiee!”\n\nRaen can see her wriggle form the outside, she imagines the heat, being barely able to breathe, the unbearable pain. Raen remembers those cute adorable little feet over her back, over her front, against her tongue. She lick her lips and arches her back as she drives her fingers deeper into herself. The Asian inside feels her fingers pop one by one, like overcooked hotdogs, the skin peeling and insides oozing out, her blood smells like cum, she was turning into cum, her skin was beginning to plumpen as well, become brittle. She felt like a water balloon; ready to burst, spurt her insides out. She still couldn’t help but writhe and scream though, wanting to be safe, not wanting to be here. Her skin trembles as she feels everything tighten around her, Raen finds her g-spot and fingers it hard, taking her over the edge, the walls of her womb clamping tightly together, squishing the Asian inside, smooshing her face as she gives one last sob, her body trembles, then explodes, her insides a nice thick helping of fem cum that gushes out of Raen in a fine spray as Raen give an impassioned howl, every muscle tightening, toes curling and eyes scrunched close as the Asian is spurted onto the floor. Raen relaxes on the table a bit, panting, before looking to the camera, blowing it a kiss and walking out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385469748", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; A ton of Internet forums, primarily reddit and 4chan as I see it, have bastardized the term into meaning stock images upon which text is superimposed.\n\nThat's an Image macro, which can also be a meme.  4chan didn't bastardize it, the people carrying it out from 4 chan, and the people who didn't understand it would use it as an almost derogatory term and so with both sides of hate and love being misinformed it became widespread to the point of even people who came TO 4 chan because of the exposure these brought would misuse it...even though technically it's not being misused as it is a meme still, just not the only definition of a meme.  Rectangle/square deal.\n\nImage macro has always been the correct term, in fact back in the day \"Milhouse is not a meme\" was a meme... just the fact that he was NOT a meme was a meme in and of itself... as in Milhouse himself wasn't the meme, the act of him not being one was.\n\n\"Anonymous\" is a meme, \"Pork Chop Sandwiches\" was a meme.  Anything that could be used as a joke-reference to other things that internet people were savvy on was a meme.\n\nHell, people use memes on this website daily.  Any time someone mentions the Cumbox, or says \"Jolly Rancher\" \"u wot m8\" \"Le\"(DISCONTINUED)\n\nYou get the idea, it's a broad sweeping term.  You seemed to get it for the most part, just though I'd expand for others a bit and also let you know from someone who was sitting there amidst the ruins of 4chan when all this started the kind of ETERNAL RAGE I feel for people talking about \"You used this meme wrong\"  \nNo, he used the image macro wrong, which means that the creation is not a meme :p", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385676052", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; **I didn't and do not condone the meme so stop bringing up irrelevant hypothetical you straw grasper**\n\nWell, maybe you should stop making oppositions of \"an internet meme\" vs \"real life\" then? Because it sure looks like you're condoning it, like, \"c'mon guys, it's not as bad as really bad things, what's your fucking problem with it?\"\n\n&gt; Because they're not equally bad, that's a false equivalence.\n\nIt's not an equivalence, it's an analogy whose purpose is to show that this thing is also bad. Why are you so antagonistic about it? Again, nobody tries to use this analogy to excuse slut-shaming or anything, so what's your fucking problem?\n\n&gt; One is discrimination via a small niche circlejerk and the other is real life sexism that happens every fucking day.\n\nOne is loser-shaming, as you nonchalantly admitted yourself, and it's a very real-world thing that happens every fucking day.\n\nI mean, that's the thing about your types that really anoints my bishops: you honestly believe that you've got all your privileges checked once and for all, at least as far as them related to \"neckbeards\" go. So then you, with a truly childlike innocence, are like, see, we just make fun of them for their loserish appearance, because they are losers, haha. It's an internet circlejerk thing, no biggie!\n\n&gt; &gt; You see, your reaction would've been justified if someone said that slut shaming is as harmless as fedora shaming, so both should be allowed. But we have an opposite statement here, why do you argue with it?\n\n&gt; What makes you think your critique is valid to call mine into justification?

The least I expected was some abuse to make it worth while. But instead, I got a couple of lame comments. Whatevs. \n\nNow we come to the point where I just fucking had it with this shitty sub and everyone in it....\n\nSee top post after I posted. A rather innocent, old picture of a child kissing a monkey in a dress. Cute. Caption? \"First interracial kiss\" or some shit like that... 1k gross up votes... Comments galore... U WOT M8?

It seemed that's what everyone on here liked, hence why I think posts like it should go somewhere else so that idiots can be idiots elsewhere and real hell worthy humour can thrive again. \n\nOh, if you're new here's a tip.
