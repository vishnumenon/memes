If someone pays $150 for a ship, how easy would that ship be to replace in game? Could a similar ship be acquired within a few hours of game time?\n\nFirst off, we don't buy ships, we give money for the development of the game and the devs give us a starting ship. Some can be acquired within a few hours of game time.\n\n&gt;Based on the pledging, it would appear this game will favor those who have hundreds/thousands to throw at it. Will there be a subscription fee also?\n\nNo favor, if you suck at flying your ship, you won't be better because you paid more. No subscription fee.\n\n&gt;I guess my main thing is that we haven't really seen any of the game yet, and there's still this massive movement over something that looks to be hardly even out of the planning phase. \n\nUntil now, this statement was true.

Some became famous for creating large fleets, others for burning said large fleets and some are known for building some 700-feet wall that it is said to guard the realm of men. All of them fooking legends, of course.\n\nAnyway, all the way back in A Clash of Kings (Season 2), after Winterfell was sacked by Ramsey Snow and injured Maester Luwin in the process, Luwin, while dying, suggested that Bran and his little brother Rickon split up in order to protect the Stark legacy. It took some convincing from Jojen but in the end he convinced Bran to try and find the Three Eyed Raven far off beyond the wall. Rickon went off with Osha.\n\n**NOTE:** I have a very good memory but keep in mind that I have last read the books 3 years ago and there's no mention on why Bran decided to take up on Jojen's word.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399261858", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "IMO it's been pretty well done and it's exciting for book watchers to see a new perspective on the characters. I like to see Jon Snow showing leadership, Bran making real decisions for himself (he's like 7 in the books so he's basically along for the ride), etc. Probably the single best added scene (IMO, there are many opinions on this) is Arya's verbal sparring with Tywin in season 2, which replaced Arya's story mainly because of restrictions on filming with kids. Those scenes were amazing, especially for a book reader. They are so true to the characters yet brand new, as if GRRM released a new short story or something.\n\nAlso there are characters like Locke or Karl who are combinations of multiple minor roles. Condensing the characters and playing-mix-and-match helps with name and face fatigue. Game of Thrones already has the biggest cast on TV, but there are over a thousand named characters in the books and it's almost impossible to learn all of them. Throw in a great actor to bring the character to life and it adds a lot to the show that would be missing if they slavishly stuck to the script.\n\nLastly the books have a very strict point-of-view structure where you only see what happens through the eyes of a handful of specific characters. You'll never see a private conversation between Littlefinger and Lysa Arryn, for example. You'll never hear Karl's \"I was a fookin legend m8\" monologue. You'll also miss Margaery and Tommen's bedside chats, or Cersei and Robert's frank conversations about their marriage in season 1.\n\nThere's only a handful of places where I feel the show's added material isn't up to snuff.

{"body": "Oh boy, where to start.\n\nOrb of Venom is great, nothing to discuss about that one.\n\nBut... your reasoning for Tranquils over Phase is that \"you start with a RoP anyway\" and you \"don't need Vlads anymore\". If I don't need Vlads anymore I won't start with a RoP, simple as that. Ursa has a starting armor of **5.52**, it's incredibly ineffective to waste almost a third of your starting gold for more armor (unless you're jungling, which is, as you said, crap). Another point of yours is that you can be \"more active around the map\" with Tranquils, searching for kills, as well as more sustainability in the lane. You won't find kills if you can't get close to people, and that's what Phase are for. Chances are your Tranquils will be broken very soon and that costs you a lot of movespeed. Broken Tranquils: **370 ms** - Active Phaseboots: **418 ms**. You won't get the regen on your lane either, at least not if you want to get any lasthits. They will be broken almost all the time, leaving you with your shitty base damage (if you don't use fury swipes stacks before, which is hard, because you will get harassed). Phase let you move in and out faster, give you enough damage to *ensure* lasthits and have great synergy with overpower (as they give just damage and no AS).\n\nThat brings me to the next point. You said that AS is not a stat that Ursa is particularly in need of, yet your core item suggestion is Armlet, which gives +25 attack speed when active. It's not much, but it's useless nonetheless. Furthermore you claimed Armlet gives him *everything* he needs, which is false, as Ursa's primary concern is **lockdown**, that's why you either have blink (to avoid wasting walking time while your team disables someone, as well as getting in range for a stomp) or Basher / Abyssal (which will most likely proc during overpower). Hex is really good on him, too, because as soon as you whack someone nobody cares if you've got Armlet and two hearts, this guy is dropping. \n\nYou're arguing that Blink/Lothars is bad because you need several kills to make up for the cost. So what? \"I don't get Abyssal Blade on Lifestealer, because I would have to kill about 20 people afterwards, to make up for the gold cost\" - yeah sure. That's not how the game works.\n\n&gt;Stunned? Nuked? No fucking problem, you have an enormous health pool and high armor to absorb the damage with\n\nTotally. I never, in my whole life as a DotA player, had any problems with being stunned, slowed, and kited while having an Armlet active, draining my HP pool. Never happens. /s\n\nAnd finally a quote from your comment:\n\n&gt;The difference is if you wasted money on a BKB or Blink, you have less health and less armor, which means you're going to be easier to kill.\n\n\"Wasting money on BKB\" - as an Ursa. U wot m8? What skill level are you even playing in? As long as the enemy team isn't running a void-bane-SD trilane, Magnus mid and Beastmaster offlane I can't imagine a lineup where BKB isn't useful. What do you think this Shadow Shaman is going to do if you try to whack him? Right, disable you for approximately 200 seconds because you think you can survive with a fucking armlet (*and good luck phasing out of the ward trap*). \n\nSorry for ranting, it's not that I think you're stupid, but you are theorycrafting too hard without really imagining how this will work out against medium competent opponents.\n\ntl;dr: If you win with this build you would have won with the standard one, too.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399370071", "subreddit": "TrueDoTA2", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

Friend of mine plays at 5500/very high or so, gets BKB in about 20% of her games at most, over 50% winrate for all games, including plenty of games when playing with shitters like me and some of our other mutual friends.\n\nBKB isn't nearly as important as people like to make it out to be.  It's probably pretty crucial at the pro level of play, where teams are highly coordinated and have an idea of what they want to do before they do it, but it's not nearly so important at the pub level of play, whether that's 3500 or 5500.  Simply knowing how to position yourself and time things properly counts for far more and makes BKB mostly a waste of 4000 gold unless it's AR or something and the enemy team was allowed to basically stack stuns to their hearts' content.\n\nI consider BKB a necessary evil in some games, but by no means is it an \"every single game\" item on any hero, not at the pub level.\n\nUrsa doesn't really need to buy lockdown for the majority of the game, because Earthshock's heavy slow and high uptime essentially do that for him.

Maybe he thought another rape threat might provoke some revelations from the other male noble born now that he's not having a seizure. \r\rI found it to be a fairly realistic depiction of what a man like Karl might do.

It was then widely accepted that at around mercantile times, we were in \"Capitalism.\" From then on out, we've just always accepted that term as our current situational identifier. This is because little actual *structure* in relations has changed since the term was developed, only content.\n\nSo, we can see that there really *is* a need to at least acknowledge historical roots and origins for ideas, concepts, words, etc. I don't think that makes me much of a historicist, but hey, whatever if I am.\n\n&gt;\"I have first principles but only twenty people agree with me so obviously the problem is your comprehension\". A property theory so solid that an infinitesimally small number of people agree with it.\n\nConsidering it's an unorthodox reading of John Locke's LTP + provisos, I don't think that criticism is warranted. It's a logical fallacy to assume that just because no one agrees with someone that they're wrong, or invalid.\n\n&gt;Edgy as fuck, son.\n\nu wot m8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399436092", "subreddit": "Anarcho_Capitalism", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I liked the Craster's keep stuff.  It gave Jon and Bran something to do to fill out the mid-season plot, but didn't totally fuck their storylines. It further established Bran's warging and played at the larger purpose of his \"destiny\" while giving us sad \"fateful choice\" moment when he chose not to call out to Jon.  My hope is that they don't just abandoned what happened either, character-wise.  Maybe Jon learns something about fighting and not clinging to \"honor\" too much after his encounter with the fooking legend that is Karl (let's face it, Jon would have lost that fight on his own).  He can then use what he learned in the upcoming battle at The Wall.  I think that would be a good addition to the plot.\n\nI feel like they wasted some potential by killing Locke so fast, but I guess since he's sort of a stand-in for Vargo, he had to die anyway.\n\nThe Littlefinger/Jon Arryn reveal was almost TOO subtle in my opinion, as it's arguably the most important plot-twist thus far, and I feel like they kinda just blew right by it.  I didn't see the \"Previously one Game of Thrones\" segment this week, so maybe they set it up better than I think, but they should have made a bigger deal out of it.  Waiting until the \"only Cat\" scene in the final episode may have worked better, I don't know.\n\nBased on the preview for next week, I'm very excited to see what happens at the Dreadfort.  My personal guess: Theon gets rescued, only to get re-captured when Ramsey takes Moat Cailin. Even better if Theon gets rescued, but then turns on the Ironborn when Ramsey attacks Moat Cailin, and it turns out Ramsay let Theon get rescued so he could be a mole (since Ramsay is so convinced \"Reek\" will never turn against the Boltons now).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399527255", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

Garth however seems to feel that they have taken some sort of moral high ground in regards to preventing shaming. The tactic employed; childish hate filled name calling. \n\nThe entire reason I spoke up at all is because you cannot combat hate with hate, you will just get more hate and less understanding. Instead of simply bashing people all up and down this thread, Garth could have taken a real moral high road and educated the original offender as to why their comment is offensive to try and curb further similar behavior. \n\n&gt;why the fuck do people feel the need to post porn about themselves? Can't they see its desperate and scummy?\n\nThese are posed as questions and to me clearly illustrates ignorance. You get rid of ignorance through education, not through name calling. Was Garth championing all the shamed sluts of the world by \"verbally\" assaulting the one who said this? It appears they seem to think so, but in reality this accomplished nothing. The person probably just chocked it up to another cheeky cunt online. Garth chose to shit talk, just like the original shit talker. So we've just got perpetual shit talking, which is why i used a sort of ad-lib comment to illustrate that their comment was no better than his. The subject material may be different, and the perspective may be justified, but the reaction was quite the same.

{"body": "Warning, long post incoming.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWell...in the spirit of an attentive audience...allow me to list what I play - and why. I have a current total of 16 decks, with a few more lists pseudo-planned out (basic concepts, ideas, key/interestin cards.) The list; in total is Hazezon, Radiant, Evangela/Oloro, Thrax/Garza, Kiki-Jiki, Krenko, Maralen, Talrand, Azusa, Rayne, Xiahou, Damia, Kaalia, Xira, Angus, Maelstrom. Two decks, Esper and Grixis have switchable generals in terms of what works with the deck and Graza Zol is just fun.\n\n- Hazezon; is just...Hazezon. It is a deck that focuses on making tokens with Hazezon, Avenger, Chancellor of the Forge, and eventually when I get a copy - Storm Herd. Then turning sideways for the win, pumping if possible with Mirror Entity, Sarkhan, Wake, Oran-Rief, Web of War and Gavony. A few instant and sorcery speed removal options, but most of the deck is about getting lands into place, then creatures - lots of them.  And should things need to die...Vicious Shadows. Now I have been a slight ass by including Purphoros, but as long as the rest of the people in my meta include him in their own decks, I shall as well.\n\n- Radiant is a funzies deck, its all about flying creatures and a small equipment package (3 swords and a spear, for now.) I just love the concept of this deck - being able to cast Storm Herd with my general in play is just pure epic timmy/vorthos/feel goods. Of course, there's always just T3 or T4 Spectral Procession into a T5(sometimes 4) Radiant for a 5 mana flying 6/6...yea. Not that great...but its often followed by Angelic Skirmisher, Galepowder Mage, Thopter Assembly, and other fun flyers :D. No mana rocks, and the only acceleration is Wayfarer's Bauble, Burnished Hart and maybe if I decided to addd it in, a Walking Atlas. I do need a Terrain Generator though...duno why I haven't yet.\n\n- Evangela/Oloro is my go to deck when I just want to \"durdle\". The entire premise of the deck focuses around getting lands into play. Specficaly, sacrifice outlets and \"maze/fog\" lands. Druidic Satchel is quite litteraly the most powerful card in the deck without a doubt. A nice Sun Titan package, 2+4-1 creatures, sorceries and instants. And the icing on the cake - not a single goddamn basic land. Oh boy, have I felt that sting before. Path to Exile, the new Ruiniation that gives back basics and my personal favorite, being exluded from the Join Forces basic land search card from the 2011 precons. Still, I do love the deck. Both generals are powerful and I can chose between them for interesting games. Oloro is really dang good with Drogskol Reaver, while Evangela can get out early and just trump on most aggro generals (without shroud/hexproof/protection) long enough for the deck to get moving properly. I am currently working on altering out all the cards, with 21 done so far, picking up 5 more this Sunday, and dropping another 5 off with the artist at the same time. So yea. My favorite deck, I think.\n\n- Thrax/Garza was litteraly built out of my binder, without any pre-mediation. I had a copy of Cruel Ultimatium and by satan, I was going to play it, somehow (also Din of the Fireherd.) This deck is focused on causing my opponents to sac creatures (but no Gravepact) all creature or insant/sorcery based.  Consuming Vapors and Undercity Plague are underdogs for sure - Far and Away is a nice card that can change combat quite nicely. Not much more to say about this deck, other then that it is my only deck with mana rocks in it. Charcoal Diamond, Chromatic Lantern, Dimir Signet, Sol Ring, Thran Dynamo. I shoul add in a Worn Powerstone, Rakdos Signet, Izzet Signet and possibly a Mana Vault...but...that many mana rocks is just lame. And I hate drawing mana rocks late game...maybe cluestones?\n\n- Kiki-Jiki is everyone's favorite mana-octupling OP goblin. Between the gauntlets, sun, cube, and koth - the mana generation of this deck gets a little nuts sometimes. It also features some not oft-seen cards like Flowstone Slide and Overseer, Fissure, and Aftershock. A fun deck for sure, but it can often get stalled out by bad draws. Getting out Top or Slate of Ancestry is a must almost (or Mind's Eye, Staff of Nin, a Wheel effect.) Still, I enjoy the deck when it does its b.s. and will just kill everyone out of nowhere with Chancellor of the Forge copy after copy (thanks Heat Shimmer!)\n\n- Krenko is just my dirty goblin combo deck. Uusally wins before turn 6. Lots of times on turn 3 or 4 with decent draws. Everyone hates this deck, and I understand completely why. I only play it when I feel someone needs to learn a lesson about \"what is and isn't fun in edh.\" Yea, I'm that sort of guy.\n\n- Maralen is a dirty, DIRTY, FILTHY DIRTY Ad Nauseum combo deck. Tuned to get her out T1 or T2 (or T3 with Shroud/Hexproof) she only needs a single turn to find Ad Nauseum and most likely win the game unless I've been dealt enough damage to put me down to less then 30 (or my library gets milled/exiled.) Not much to say, she can combo off in a few different ways, Storm, lots of mana for exanguinate, or just a small horde (like 30-40) zombies from Zombie Infestation. No one ever complains about the zombie win.\n\n- Talrand is to Arcum, as Daakon is to Zur. Not at all close in power levels. Most of Talrand's spells (and one of the two creatures in the deck) are 1 mana or less. There is a small splattering (4-5 cards) that are over 1 mana, but its all about hitting people with drakes and drawing more cards to get more drakes. The cheap Blue buyback spells are just icing on top of cheesecake of awesome! Of course...if Talrand gets stolen, tucked or otherwise becomes uncastable...the deck is pretty much FUBAR.\n\n- Azusa is my combo deck of choice when I go against people trying to combo that aren't playing Zur or Arcum. Other then Explore, there isn't a single instant or sorcery that says \"search your library for land/basic and put it into your hand/battlefield.\" I run Burnished Hart though.... This deck is crazy scary sometimes and will vomit itself onto the board turn after turn. Nothing says 'no, you may not' like multiple same-turn Gen Waves that just keep getting bigger. Of course, the recent rules change regarding how lands are played nerfed the deck hard....damn you WotC!\n\n- Rayne is...well....evil. Sadistic. Cruel. Heartless. In my two decades of Magic I've never honestly faced a deck similar to my Rayne deck. Nothing good ever comes from playing this, the butthurt is just...universal. I'm sorry for infinite Time Stop Locks in combination with an Infinite Spell/Board Lock. But you totally deserve it if I'm playing this deck.\n\n- Xaihou is just another monoblack control/combo deck. The whole purpose of which is to infinte Praetor's Grasp or Temporal Extortion everyone out of the game. Yes, you read that right. My win con is either A. I'll take your library (and everyone elses.) or B. You pay life or I take another turn, then repeat this process till I have the resources to kill you, or you die from paying life.) This is a very difficult deck to pilot, more so then almost any other deck I've ever seen. It is fragile, weak in defense, weak in offense and can be easily disrupted. It also plays Contamination...which generates lots of butthurt. But I enjoy playing this deck for the sheer pleasure of trying to pilot it correctly. And the old saying \"Yawgmoth's Win\" really does apply to this deck.\n\n- Kaalia is just a less then standard Kaalia, there are no mana rocks, and only a single source of mass land destruction (Desolation Angel.) The recent addition of Sneak Attack has given it a bit more \"oomph\" but in all honestly, most of the time I'm paying full retail cost for my creatures anyway, and it is enjoyable to do so. Big, bomby, threatening creatures with a few odd-balls like Ebon Dragon, Blinding Angel and Spirit of the Night thrown in for fun. Lord of the Void in this deck makes for some very fun games (on my end at least :D) A single pair of Lightning Greaves and Darksteel Plate is about all the protection the deck has against removal. Its a very fair deck as Kaalia decks ago and a blast to play. (most of the time.)\n\n- Angus ... was an attempt to take my Lady Evangela deck and switch the black for green. It didn't work out to well...but it works some of the time. I rarely play this deck unless I know its going to be a slower game. The lack of big threats hurts this deck a lot, but it does have a lot of utility going for it at least. Still not fun to play, most of the time.\n\n- Maelstrom is my newest deck and \"is the worst maelstrom wanderer deck ever.\" Because that is what it is, as soon as his price spicked a few weeks ago I drove down to my LGS and picked him up before they corrected their pricing (do I feel bad about that, no, I tell them when they need to adjust their pricing on expensive cards like FoW, and Wasteland when they go up. This supports the LGS in properly pricing thier product so they remain open for me to enjoy playing there.) As far as the contents of this deck....well....the fact that it wins games continues to surprise everyone, myself included.

{"body": "I am on the same boat with my art hobby man, at first I thought, \"oh man ima be the bees knees one day\". Now that I've dropped out of a lot of circles of friends, it is purely my influence on my art work and not a standard to be approved of by others. I didn't do much after high school except work minimum wage jobs to smoke pot and buy art supplies. So, when I look back at my years in my early twenties, it satisfies me that even though I didn't travel much or anything like that. I still explored the terrain around me outside to draw and paint and that in itself will be something to look back on. Plus, I'd rather have hundreds of drawings stacked up in my parents basement then like expensive hip hoppy shoes and things that people usually buy that have little to no sentimental value.\n\nI took a lot of time at my community college to go through their art degree, at the same time I was spending most of my time going on my own art exhibitions. Theirs only so much you can learn from a class, the real experience is when you literally open that door to go outside and paint. I was amazed, in my painting class that I just took, that when we had the last three weeks of good weather to go outside and draw, most of the class I could tell was intimidated more than excited to go out and paint landscapes. Like, you can draw a tissue box on a table to it's perfection, but once you're looking at something 500 yards away on a vast landscape it's like a whole other animal to take on... I was very surprised when I looked for everyone else in my class to see if they were outside but most of them chose to paint in the hallways instead. \n\nArt is about living in the moment, doing what I'm doing now, typing away my feelings. Art puts you in a zone where you are left with yourself and your own thoughts. So, treat yourself nicely and you may have a smooth easy going looking painting. Have a bad day at work and your picture may come out all scratchy and disproportionate. Go out their after reading a few chapters on zen practicing and make it damn count. Doing this also makes you feel like you're outside and not just walking through the woods like you're in a movie where the reel keeps on spinning. It's better than taking a zillion pictures also, when you sit down and draw a landscape for thirty minutes in one spot you will see things you didn't see the first time you looked at them. whether it be the trees on that hill over their, or even just playing your thoughts over in your head, giving you time to think, will help clear things out. Having an apartment close to a wooded area is like an artists Disney Land. You better go fookin' nuts out their and start singing to those birds John, for they know the secrets towards great success!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399924137", "subreddit": "Psychonaut", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Belgium glorifies Leopold II.\n\nYou wot?\n\nedit: I feel like I need to go further into this. Belgians fully acknowledge what Leo did and that what he did was evil. \nNobody wants that power back for the monarchs. Absolutely nobody.\nAs such we don't have any anti-leopold glorification laws or sentiment similar to Germany because there was never a big pro movement anyway. \n\nAt best the government reacts apathetic as if he were merely a another face in the history books.\nThey just maintain him as a part of history and if he is even mentioned it isn't positive.\n\nAdditionally he wasn't the face of a national political movement like Stalin or Hitler were. Hell the actions in Congo had nothing to do with what the government decided. It think it's mainly seen as a mix of a dictatorship and a corporatocracy as he literally had concessionary companies own not only land but the people on them. He let them do their thing and they paid him taxes with the profits they gained from their horrendous exploitation.\n\nAdditionally we were never affected by it and as a result there are still a few places that carry his name for example. Sure that doesn't justify the apathetic stance towards it and we should probably do away with those but it does explain it. There's a reason his rule was taken down not by a riseup of the people or a war but by [international media action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State_propaganda_war#The_Downfall). He only managed to rule by denying most atrocities to the west and even his home-country.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399924629", "subreddit": "europe", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to shrug off the pc players who mocked consoles (being a console fan for the past 30 years and owning close to all of them).\n\nThen came out the PS4; but sadly I felt a little let down by the line-up launch games; and when I finally noticed that I hadn't even booted it up in about four months (and swear on me mum, we're talking just over a 1000 cumulative hours spent on all BF games: meaning that I do usually play a lot) I took the plunge and built myself a beefy computer ... Oh My God, what a world of a difference.\n\nIt's so hard now not to look down on you guys (seriously, no offence) when the PS4 is clinging onto 1080p for dear life, barely ever breaking the 30 fps mark (which when it does the developers are basically slapping each other on the back like they just broke the speed of light), when here we are, decades ahead of consoles, with 1440p, 120Hz no sweat, on all games.\n\nOut of nostalgia I'll peruse /r/ps4 and sometimes, stumble upon a post like this and  chuckle at how I too used to feel cheated when even the most basic of resolutions+fps couldn't be achieved. Now it's like watching old people try to convince you that their flip-phone is way better than an iPhone.\n\nI don't want to be *that guy*, but if ever anyone gets the chance to move away from consoles, DO IT !

And my mom got it all on video (that I will not post until I am certain I won't be doing job interviews for a long time).\n\nAnyway, the surgery itself wasn't bad, I went under in a few minutes, and woke up almost immediately after they finished up.  To be perfectly honest, I didn't (and still don't) remember shit from the first 45 minutes of the drive home.  About 10 minutes from home, my memory started returning, along with my sanity, and I went home just fine.  The recovery was easy, there was no bleeding after the first 2 hours, no swelling, not much pain, and I didn't need any of the vicodin I was prescribed.  Pretty easy overall.  I will mention that this was 7 days before Thanksgiving, and I was really looking forward to mashed potatoes, and a nice family dinner.  Then, at dinner, I found out that my mom had recorded the entire drive home.\n\nThe video, needless to say, is fucking hilarious.  It starts as we leave the oral surgeons office, and continues for the duration of the ride home.  Before I tell much more, I will say that I have never sworn (profusely) in front of my mom, as she hates it.  The first thing I say in the video, to my horror when she showed this video to my entire extended family, was, \"What the FUCK?!?! I'm seein' two of goddamn everything!\"  This kind of general complaining. Just with harsher words.  Then we ended up behind a prius, going particularly slow, to which I screamed, \"GODDAMN YOU PRIUS FUCKS! YOU DRIVE A FUCKING TAMPON ON WHEELS, GO DIE!\"  This mortified me when I saw it, because my aunt, who albeit is a smug prius driver, was in the room watching this video.  Although I won't say that I didn't think it was funny.  \n\nThe next ten minutes of the vid are me making obscure doge jokes, that only me and my sisters understood when watching it, to which we laughed our asses off.  Then, for some reason unknown to me, I switched to a british accent.  And a pretty damn good one at that (or at least as good as it can get with a slightly swollen face.  The swear-heavy rambling went of for a few minutes, when suddenly, I turn to my mom, and shout as loud as I could, \"U WOT M8? U HAVIN A GIGGLE AT ME FACE?  I'LL BASH YE FOOKIN HEAD IN, I SWARE ON MI MUM!\"  No joke...I swore on my mum while talking shit to my mum....Needless to say, I felt retarded.\n\nThose are basically the highlights of the video, considering my multiple attempts to call some of my friends ended with voicemails.  The rest of the day went great, however, and by the end of the day, I managed to build my new computer, because the parts had shown up at my house during the surgery.  I still am amazed that I decided to do this, considering that the parts totaled about $1200, and were particularly fragile in my anesthesia-numbed limbs.  \n\nThats the end. Story time is over.  And no, there is no chance I will post the video.

He tied his horse’s reins to a nearby tree and took a knee as he set up his camp.  Behind him, he heard footsteps.\n\n“What have we here, boys,” (the most annoying fucking voice on planet fucking earth) said behind him.  \n\nThe Mountain looked over his shoulder and saw five men approaching with swords drawn.  The man at the head of the group spoke again, “There’s a toll to pass through these parts.”\n\nGregor rose from his knee and faced the five men.  Faced with the Mountain’s full size, the highwaymen’s faces grew even paler in the moonlight.\n\n“Well, aren’t you a big fookin cont,” Karl Tanner said, unfazed by the monster that stood before him.  \n\nWithout another word, Tanner’s men turned and ran.  Tanner stretched his lips back to reveal a shit-eating grin and muttered, “Good.  Now the adults can talk.”\n\n“I’m here on business of the King,” the Mountain said in a deep voice.  “Leave my campsite.”\n\n“Ah,” Tanner said, pacing before the massive swordsman.  “Business of the king, eh?  I know a thing or two about sacred matters meself.  Ever been to Gin Alley?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’m a fooking legend in Gin Alley.”\n\n“I’ve met many men who claim to be legends.  If you have to tell someone that you are a legend, it is often not so.”\n\nTanner drew two short swords and dug his feet into the snow.\n\n“What tha fook did you just fookin say about me, you little cont,” Karl demanded.  “I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Gin Alley, and I’ve been involved on numerous secret raids on the Eyrie, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.  I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sellsword in the whole of Westeros.  You are nothing to me but another dead man.  I will wipe you fookin out with swordplay, the likes of which has never been seen before in all the seven kingdoms, mark my fookin words.  You think you can get away with doubting my status as a legend on this campsite?  Think again, cont.  As we speak, my men are returning back to Craster’s Keep, and bringing back an entire army of former Nights Watchmen, so you’d better prepare for winter, maggot.  The winter that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.  You’re fookin dead, cont.  I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with me bare hands.  Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to an entire armory of the Night’s Watch, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

{"body": "Sorry for the wait.\n\nSo.  The sheriff arrived and dropped off papers.  Had me sign proving they were served.  And explained that they do not declare me the only father.  Only a possible father.  \nUpon reading the papers I found that she was putting this child up for adoption. \nAnd that the due date was February 2014.  \nBeforehand while I was freaking out I called my best friend whom was roommates with me at the time.  And he informed me he remembered me and her together in February.\n\nTalking with my dad, he told me they pass out this paperwork to ALL possible fathers to see if any of them are interested in stopping said adoption.\n\nRemembering what her father said about her running away with other boys as well, I decided this child was NOT mine.  Especially since we were together in February.. 12 months pregnancy?  Nah man. That ain't mine!\n\nJanuary 9th.  I get a call from the adoption facility.  \"Hey Richard?  Blahblahblah would you like to still be in contact with the adopting family?\"\nI apologize ma'am but this is not my child, we were together in February.\n\"Are you sure?  You're the only possible father she listed....   And she states you two were together in May..?\"\nI need to call you back.\n\nAfter checking Facebook AGAIN.  There it was.  *Tagged with her on may 26th* \"Having \nA wonderful time\" \n\nShit\nShit\nShitshitshitshit that's my kid.\n\n\nAfter consulting my family, I made the decision to want the kid and stop the adoption.\nSo I called back and she informed me i couldn't.  \nSo I scheduled meetings with my attorney.\nMy family jumped the gun as well and bought EVERYTHING I may need for a kid.\n\nAnd my attorney told me I'm fucked. \nI was properly served, and given a 30 day limit to stop the adoption.  And those papers I never answered said if I ignored them past that 30 day limit, I lose all rights to show ANY interest in the child. \nMy attorney told me he would be happy to take my money and file.\nBut the judge would have to dismiss the case, because I fucked up.\nBUT THERES HOPE!\nHe told me the mother could still stop the adoption since she still had rights!\nAnd that in many cases the birthfather would call her and have her sign rights over to him!\n\nSo I called her, and she said she would work with me!   I told her we could work it out,  I would take care of the child, and she could come visit and all.  \n\nShe told me she couldn't take care of it.\nAnd after some time I learned that her parents are ASSHOLES, and told her if she kept the child, they would make her move out.  With the child.. Knowing well she couldn't support it.\nApparently they found adopting parents.  Family friends that go to the same church as them, who are infertile and just got an adoption certificate.\nSo I offered to take it, and still offered custody.  So it was still ours, so we wouldn't have to watch somebody else raise our child. Her parents wouldn't have any of it, and threatened to kick her out, and twisted her mind.  Saying that the child needed to be in a two parent home. (If I were to take the child, I would not get back with the birth mother.  I have a new girlfriend as you remember.) they told her that this child would be unstable and unhappy!\nWhich is incredibly STUPID.  She lives with her father, who remarried.  And her stepmother brought a child into the household that isn't her fathers.\nFuckin hypocrites.. Right?\nSo She yelled at me, saying I was inconsiderate! And that I didn't think of what is best for the child..  \nSomehow I was able to get her to agree with me still.  Offering to talk to her parents for her.  And she agreed.  \n\nThen she stopped answering my calls and texts.\n\nFor a week I was in the dark.\n\nFinally I tracked down her house, that I was at ONE time, (remember how I dropped her off a year ago? Lol). It took 4 hours of driving around town to jog my memory. \n\nShe refused to talk to me, and her stepmother opened the door and shut it instantly, ignoring me.\nHer father then comes out the garage, telling me to leave their property and to consult legal advice.  Saying the adoption agency attorney told them not to contact me anymore.\nI was able to stay and speak with her father.  And explain I would take the child! \nHe was having none of it.  Saying it is his daughters choice (u wot m8) \nSo I showed him the texts proving she said she would work with me! I had a LONG talk with him showing him that I and my family WANT to do the right thing and take on this child! \nI told him EVERYTHING.  ESPECIALLY how I cant do anything legally, and this is all I have left to do! \n\"Well I have to talk to her and see what she wants to do.\"\n\nHe then asks me to leave his property.  So I politely shook his hand, and gave him my number.\n\nTwo weeks later he calls me and tells me they all agreed that adoption is what they will do and I should seek legal counsel.\nFucking asshole.\n\nSo I had myself a cry.  And I admitted defeat. \nI had my family return the baby stuff.  \nAnd I called the adoption center.  \nI told the nice lady that I wanted to be apart of my child's life.. In any way possible.  Even if it means watching her be raised by somebody else, from the sideline.\nI would have named her Amber Rose.\nI met the adopting family.  And they're very nice people.  \nIt was really tough to meet them.  And even meet my daughter.  (She was born by the way.. February. Lol)\nI tried so hard not to cry.\n\nI hope to grow to Love them, a part of my own family.\nBut if I EVER come to meet the eyes of this birth mother, and her parents. I have some words for her.  From myself, and my WHOLE family.\n\nWhat do you all think?  Am I right for feeling this way..?

A girls going to be following you around with puppy dog eyes when she's really attracted to you. \n\n3) This is acting out of position of inferiority. By worrying about what's going through your \"LTR's\" head your essentially admitting you're insecure about the relationship and at that point your coming from a powerless position and using this to in a way try to \"compensate\".

{"body": "Hello Richard, big fan here. I've only  been following eSports since 2011 when LoL started to gain momentum, so while I realise you have a long eSports history behind you, I can only question and comment on your work within the LoL scene.\n\nI think a lot of people within the LoL scene find you having sort of a 'dual nature'. One is the articulate and intellectual journalist whose articles on NiP/Lemondogs (despite your own subsequent disappointment with it) and the 'Hotel Intruder'-article have impressed me and others. Your editorials often got the very underrated effect of creating large amounts of follow-up discussion and responses, most noticeably when you released your 'Leave Britney Alone: A Response to Wickd' editorial that prompted responses from Wickd, Elementz and a host of other people. Or even your 'Chaox Leaving' editorial, which I believe was your first LoL-related piece of content. All around a great force for good in this community, and probably in the other scenes as well.\n\nYour other 'nature' is what I, as a non-British European, can only describe as being a classical 'u wot m8' English attitude. I even believe, if my memory has done its duty, you referred to this aspect yourself in an episode of 'Unfiltered'. I think many people here and on Twitter have been incapable of handling your more confrontational side. Some onlookers have been repulsed by your unnecessarily long Reddit and twitter feuds with MonteCristo and others.  Personally, I don't have any problem with it. Sterilized attitude-free discourse is boring and soulless. I couldn't have Monte without a bit of sassy arrogance, or Thorin with his semi-thuggish demeanor. \n\nYour typical response over the past year to criticism of your work, has often revolved around Reddit not understanding the concept of an editorial. And while I agree with this defense, and that the LoL scene as a whole is rather \"dumb and young\" as I would've put it, it is also a bit of an oversimplification. I believe it is a combination of this, and our incapability of handling your inner 'u wot m8'-ness.\n\nNow, I'm never in favour of censorship or writers limiting themselves. This is even more true when it comes to pro-players and criticism of their behaviour as 'role models'. But I wonder if you ever considered to what degree it would be in your own interest to cut down on the confrontational side. Or is it necessary for you to have this side 'to work' as a journalist, so to speak? Or am I simply misunderstanding your mannerisms entirely? :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400088022", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;  I took that as to meaning that I should back off for a while. \n\nSpot on.  That's exactly the situation.\n\nThe girl initially is interested. You meet. You're nervous and babble instead of making her be nervous and babble with your suave seductive self. She gets the \"oh boy, he's one of those guys\" vibe from you, and suddenly she's not sure when she can make it.  That's her letting you down easy, without hurting your feelings. Called the soft rejection, it's still about as hard as it gets as far as her intent. \n\n&gt; My plan was to basically lay it all out for her the next time I see her\n\nYou Wot, mate? Three months later??? Lay it on her?????\nI need to come round your place and smack you, so you wake the hell up and smell the coffee.  The girl rejected you, this happens all the time.\n\nThe thing you need to do is meet new women.  She wasn't one in a million, don't kid yourself. She was one OF a million. The only reason you're stuck on her is because your reptilian hind brain commands you to fuck this woman, and you still haven't, so it'll keep commanding you until the stimulus is gone. And you'll keep rationalizing why she's \"the one\", how you just need to battle for your love to win her heart, and all this kind of stuff.  That's the movies, in real life you don't ever do that, man. \n\nDo not give yourself permission to get stuck on this girl. It's out of the question, you have to be more disciplined and driven than those base mammalian instincts. You acknowledge them, you do your best to satisfy your urge, but the moment it doesn't serve you, that instinct is not your friend. It's exactly like an obsessive compulsive thing some people have where they have to brush their teeth 150 times a day; tell yourself, no.\n\nIf it makes it any easier, you should recognize that the realities of the \"meat market\" for girls and boys are vastly different;  she has already gone out with about 20 other dudes since she's met you. She has that much abundance by default, she's an attractive young girl. You don't, you have to work hard and be the best man you can be, to get anywhere near that. Now imagine what she'll feel when that nervous babble guy who she thought she rejected ages ago, AGES ago, comes out of the woodwork and declared undying love for her?  She'll be wondering if she needs to call the police or what, dude.\n\nThe first law of girls. Girls don't give a fuck how much you like and adore them, and she will never like you more for it.

It's +8 damage for the entire lane at level 1, and +14 at level 3; that is a *HUGE* amount of bonus damage to be giving allies.

{"body": "&gt; Don't know why people downvote , but even with rotation Standard is cheaper in the long run and Wizards won't possibly ban out your 1000$ deck randomly.\n\nI definitely disagree. How much does it cost to play a tier 1 competitive deck in Standard? According to Tappedout, my current Esper deck (competitive list) is anywhere from $330-$990. That's only in the current form. Every set has a bit of upkeep, getting certain cards. Don't forget about adapting a sideboard every few weeks if you need to adjust. Taking the mid-price from Tappedout ($479.58, let's call it $480), calling the upkeep every set $15 (just various rares/uncommons), that's about $525-550 once all the sets come out. This is assuming of course you stick with one deck and it stays Tier 1. So, $550/year to play Standard for one year. \n\nNow, let's look at Modern. As most people agree, Melira Pod (arguably one of the best decks in the format) costs about $1000-1300. That equals out to about $1300/year to play Modern. Oh, wait, that's not quite right, because Modern doesn't rotate. You could continue playing Melira Pod for years. In fact, if you play it for more than 2 years and some change (approx. 4-5 months worth), you've matched the cost for Standard. Anything after that is just value. \n\n&gt; Plus it is a ridiculous format with ridiculous, anti-fun gameplay. It's as entertaining as a fookin' STD. Also it is pretty much not interactive either, it is only about who combos first and/or faster. Or who has the most money cards in their hands \"Well, I've got 2 Fetches, Liliana, Confidant and 'Goyf, GG\".\n\nWhile there are plenty of combo decks in Modern, that's not the entirety of the format. Melira Pod, a popular combo deck, is as good as it is, not only because of the combo, but also the fact it's a really good midrange deck as well. Another popular deck (less so, with the banning of Deathrite Shaman) was Jund, which was a B/G attrition strategy primarily based around Liliana of the Veil, Dark Confidant, and Tarmogoyf. No combos there. \n\nAs far as the \"most money cards wins\" argument, that's definitely not true. Have you not seen the cheaper decks, like Affinity? There were two of them in the top 8 of GP Richmond, one of the biggest Magic tournaments ever. \n\nFurthermore, yes, Magic is an expensive hobby. The price of entry is not a \"who spends more, wins more\" but instead a \"who spends more, competes.\" Look at pro players, all playing really good (and yes, expensive) decks. In each game of magic, there's a winner and a loser, so even though both spent a lot on a deck, only one can win. It's about skill as well. \n\n&gt; And anyone who thinks that Wizards has any intention to support a non-eternal format (Legacy/Vintage, which now will make them shit tons of money on MODO, or EDH which makes them money indirectly and by Commander pre-cons) or beside their main cash-cow Draft/Standard is fooling himself.\n\nDo you not remember the last Pro Tour? It was Modern. Modern is Wizard's non-rotating format of choice, since they can control the card pool. This is unlike Legacy/Vintage, where the reserved list kind of screwed them up. With Modern, they can reprint anything they want to, and ban cards to keep the format fresh. Rarely does a banning completely kill a deck. \n\n&gt; Instead of keeping up with reprints they will just X this like Extended in a year or two. Trust me.\n\n&gt;PS: the only people who want to encourage you to play Modern are the ones who benefit from it the most: the secondary market. Mainly SCG.\n\nHow convenient that they are the ones hosting most events for it, too, while it is very unpopular at regular local tourneys or LGS's.\n\nSCG is definitely more into Legacy than Modern. When was the last time SCG hosted a Modern tournament? Their Open Series are Standard/Legacy. \n\nMeanwhile, Modern is definitely popular at the local scene. Both LGS' in my town (and the one when I'm off at school) host modern events (FNM or just tournaments during the week) at a minimum of once a month (my usual store increasing this to every Friday starting in June). \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400175018", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had this problem in console when I played CoD. PC players that went from Counter Strike to CoD always complained about how much better their community was compared to CoD, yet they always played CoD. Now why is that? Could it be that deep down they liked CoD? Probably not, because even CoD players don't like CoD. Most likely because they weren't that good at CS. Even the worst Counter Strike player is a God amongst CoD players, and they know that. Seems like the same with you. Okay, you have a lot of hours played. What does that tell me? You're not telling me any awards you've gotten or tournaments you've won. Means your hours don't add up to much, so you come to Smite where you're a God amongst.......Gods o.o No one is going to listen to you because your arguments revolve around \"well it works in Dota\"..........THIS......IS.......SMITE\n\nAs far as we know the toxicity could just be spreading because we've managed to attract \"veterans\" of other MOBA's. I'm not a Smite fanboy. The game has it's flaws but in time they'll get fixed. As far as gamechat goes they can use Skype, TeamSpeak, even Xbox Live chat if they want to so badly. VGS is fine.

{"body": "As a former Beijingese I can provide a bit more context.\n\nA lot of people know this as the Beijing accent (and I get a lot flack from my southern chinese friends for having this accent). In actuality, this was originally just a linguistic trend that becomes more and more pronounced as you move northwards in China. The more north you go, the more people will use this \"er yin\" when they speak. \n\nHowever, Beijing, being the capital of china and one of the most culturally influential cities in the country is the most well known place where people say this. Over time it became almost synonymous with the Beijing accent. (which by the way is a lot more complex and interesting than just adding \"er\"s randomly). \n\nThe fact that it is so pronounced in Beijing accent is also partially because the Mandarin Standard Dialect was based off the Beijing accent (heh perks of being the imperial city), so the \"Er yin\" that is prevalent in colloquial Beijing speech became one of the only few differences there are between Beijing accent and Standard Dialect. Hence the impression of \"Beijing accent is just standard Chinese but with random Ers everywhere!\".\n\nWikipedia states that the usage of Ers in speech also increases as one moves north. Manchurians place it on almost every noun while Beijing speakers only place it on some nouns. However, I heard some Manchurians say the opposite, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nI _can_ speak to its usages within Beijing. Er yin in Beijing accent does not mean haphazardly adding \"er\" to every word. Instead, it has a bunch of tacit rules that speakers know. \n\nI can't list out all the different tenets of the rules, but here are a few example usecases I can remember off the top of my head.\n\n* Having Er adds informality to a word. Speaking to a friend: \"Wo ai chi e _gar_\" (I love eating goose livers) vs \"Tong xue men, ming tian wo men yao xue xi _gan_ the gong neng\" (students, tomorrow we will learn the liver's functions).\n\n* Adding Er diminuates a noun. \"Wo na _guer_ da ni\" (I'll grab a stick and hit you). vs \"Ni Gan ma? Wo na _gun_ da ni\" (U wot m8, I'll grab a fockin' pole and rek u m8)\n\n* It shortens certain phrases. \"Ni qu _nar_ le? (where did you go?) vs \"Ni qu na li le?\" (where did you go?)\n\nAlso note that, er can't be added everywhere. If a word contains many characters, it can only be added to the end, and only if it makes sense. Gun can become gur. Gun zi can't become gur zi nor gun zier.

It was the defense and the running game that gave up the cookies in the Super Bowl and the o-line that fucked up against the Colts.  \n&gt; Your PB was 2nd best in the lague, not really anywhere to go with that, but sure it will make you \"better\"  \n  \nI never said anything about pass blocking although our o-line will be superior to what it was last year, especially in the run game on both sides.  \n&gt; Yeah you replaced a 13000 and 11 TD WR with a 650-700 yard 6 TD WR and bolstered your depth with a WR who could barley break 1000 yards in the big 10....and you know rookies WR have such a great track record of producing.  \n  \nI never said Sanders was better than Decker but it's not much of a drop off especially with Peyton at QB plus Sanders is faster than Decker and can stretch the field.  \n&gt; Yeah you replaced a 13000 and 11 TD WR with a 650-700 yard 6 TD WR and bolstered your depth with a WR who could barley break 1000 yards in the big 10....and you know rookies WR have such a great track record of producing.  \n  \nWare is going to be a monster this season, mark my words. In Dallas he never had the benefit of having the best pass rusher in the league on the other side of him. And Dallas cut him because they're in cap hell and couldn't afford to pay him what he's worth, look that shit up before you talk about it.  \n&gt; Your run stopping wasn't even that bad last season, your secondary was just laughable so good thing you addressed by signing the most expensive SS with coverage liability to shore up your run stoppage.  \n  \nU wot. Ward is far from a liability in coverage not to mention he is far better than Ihenacho and Mike Adams and is a massive upgrade at the SS position.

I'm not arguing that WotC can't/shouldn't charge $150 for the next edition of D&amp;D.

I'm not currently interested in D&amp;D. If I were, I would break out my 4e books before throwing down that money, unless I saw that 5e were noticeably way better. If I didn't have my 4e books, I would strongly consider another system such as Pathfinder, which I've never tried but a lot of people love -- and costs just $30. If I wanted to consider another D&amp;D-like, I might consider 13th Age, which somehow manages to sell a complete system for $45ish. Or I might consider another system, such as Dungeon World or Savage Worlds or Fate Core, all of which cost less to play, and all of which I'm more interested in right now.

{"body": "Ah. I see. Well let's see how I can word this...\n\nWell, I didn't misspell anything when I said \"1v1 me irl bruv\". \"IRL\" stands for \"in real life\", and 1v1 means person vs. person. \"Bruv\" is just a british-accented version of the word \"bruh\" or \"bro\".\n\nNow, as a whole, \"1v1 me irl bruv\" isn't a copypasta, as you'll see below. Instead, it's an on-going... joke? I suppose? Basically, it's used to capture the personality of an 11 year old immature shit talker; the kind you find on CoD. The whole conversation is supposed to be ladened in a thick, ignorant British accent. The dialogue is as follows, usually.\n\nRedditor 1: \"Hey redditor 2, you suck\"\n\nRedditor 2: \"1v1 me irl bruv\"\n\nRedditor 1: \"Oi, r u 'avin a giggle m8? I swea on me mum I'll hook ya in ya jabba rite quick, I swea\"\n\n#And so on.\n\nNow, a copypasta is a body of text that was found so funny or ridiculous or what have you, that it was saved and replicated on places all over the internet. You could say that the \"1v1 me irl bruv\" thing is a copypasta, but it really isn't due to the fact that it's subject to change, pending on the situation.\n\nA great example of a copypasta is something you've more than likely heard of before: The Navy Seal copypasta. Beware; for he is trained in gorilla warfare.\n\n&gt;*What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.*\n\nSo there you have it.

{"body": "###Not Cocktail of the Week #73: Dry Martini\n\nWhere to start on the Dry Martini? Of all the 'classics' in the fluid world of mixed drinks, few are as famous, enticing, but seemingly unapproachable. Few are as instantly associated with the word 'cocktail' but simultaneously seldom ordered at the bar. Few have lent their name to so many related and unrelated drinks. And most certainly, few have as many variations or personal touches on a pretty steadfast and simple concept as the Martini.\n\n***\n\n###\"Martini\"\n\nWait, I *say* Martini. I mean Dry Martini. In some old books they're two different drinks. But these days? If you ask for a Martini, your bartender's not going to ask you between “classic” or “dry.” They'll most likely ask “gin or vodka?” If you ask me for a “Dry Martini,” I'll probably think you want a Dry Martini, you're just calling it a “Martini” and you're specifying it to be “dry” – a high ratio of gin to vermouth. If you wanted a “Martini” that wasn't so dry you would have said something like “Can I have a Martini, but pretty wet please,” because everybody knows that a wet Martini is just a Dry Martini but with a lot of dry vermouth, right?\n\nPerhaps I've sipped more than I can gulp. Let's start at the top. There's a lot of scattershot information out there, a lot of sources and a lot of already very-well-written literature on the background of the Martini, and I'm going to try and put together the most comprehensive but accessible introduction I can.\n\nFor this reason, I'm going to break a little tradition for this week. I'm going to mash the *Background* and *Recipes* sections together and instead split the sections up into the different connected history and recipes. The evolution of the drink, from its humble beginnings as a twist on a twist to the uncertainty of each personal recipe during the contemporary cocktail revival movement, is crucial to your own preferred version as well. There's absolutely no *wrong* way to make a Dry Martini. Your favourite matches with a certain point in time through the drink history. I'll make comments about each recipe and their place in history as we go along.\n\nFirst, let's start with a quick look at the “Martini” before we rush into the “Dry”ness.\n\n***\n\n###Primordial Booze – The Origins \n\nFor chronology's sake, I should note a story from *Shaken Not Stirred, A Celebration Of The Martini*. I'm paraphrasing this, going on someone else's word that it's in the book, so bear with me. Apparently Johann Paul Aegius Schwartzendorf (1741-1816), a Bavarian composer, emigrated to France in 1758. He changed his name to Jean Paul Aegide Martini, perhaps because Italian composers were “in” and he wanted some of the action. According to a biographical account – of which I can't find any source – his favorite drink was gin and white wine. Supposedly Martini's popularity made other customers order his drink by his name, and then emigrating French drinkers would start using the word in America.\n\nThis story seems very shaky (not stirry) and not backed up by anything. At that time, Martini wouldn't have even been drinking what we call gin, but genever, as what we know as gin today didn't exist back then. You need a neutral spirit to distill our version of gin, and the column still that made the production of neutral spirit practical wasn't developed until the 1820s, after Martini's death. At least this tale provides us one little fact: the word Martini is in the common lexicon before the drink starts appearing. It's a popular name. But then, we knew that: There's been bottles of vermouth with the word Martini on them since 1863.\n\nThe main general theory is that “Martini” is a bastardization of the word “Martinez,” which if both words are being spoken in the world around the same time, isn't that much of a stretch. Martinez in a French accent is “Mar-ti-ney,” obviously close to Martini. It's not only easy to imagine a lost-in-accentuation, mispronounced word turning into a new noun when a drink starts to change over time, it's actually pretty documented. David Wondrich notes in *Imbibe!* that there was a Judge by the name of Martine kicking around in the Manhattan Club in the mid-1800s and his name might have something to do with the Martinez, the Martini, both, or the change from one to the other, but to cut a long story short it's a stretch of a theory. Let's just have a look at the Martinez first.\n\nThe basic ideas of the Martinez and Martini look pretty similar. Briefly check out the [NCotW on the Martinez](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ck6v2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_15_martinez/) and you can see that by 1887 when Jerry Thomas's second edition of the *Bartender's Guide* comes out (two years after his death – presumably the finished manuscript was buried hidden under a pile of waistcoats, bow ties and tins of mustache wax) the Martinez is essentially a twist on a Manhattan. You substitute a sweet and spicy whiskey for sweet and botanical gin and voila, new drink. The recipe concept of the time is essentially: a reasonably sweet “Old Tom” gin, sweet vermouth, a modifier if desired (maraschino liqueur most often) and a dash of bitters.\n\nThen just one year later in 1888, Harry Johnson's *Bartender's Manual* is published and includes a recipe for a “Martini:”\n\n*Bartender's Manual*, Harry Johnson, 1888\n&gt;\n&gt;**Martini Cocktail**  \n&gt;Fill up the glass with ice;  \n&gt;2 or 3 dashes of gum syrup (be careful in not using too much);  \n&gt;2 or 3 dashes of bitters (Boker's genuine only);  \n&gt;1 dash of curaçao or absinthe, if required;  \n&gt; ½ wine-glass of old Tom gin;  \n&gt; ½ wine-glass of vermouth.  \n&gt;Stir up well with a spoon; strain it into a fancy cocktail glass; put in a cherry or a medium-sized olive, if required; and squeeze a piece of lemon peel on top, and serve (see illustration, plate No. 13).  \n&gt; *– Harry Johnson, Bartender's Manual*\n\nAlso in Henry J. Wehmann's *Bartenders Guide* of 1891, his “Martini” recipe is identical but for the omission of the optional absinthe.\n\nIn the *Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book* the author describes a “Claret” wine glass as holding between three and a half to four ounces, so half a wine-glass would be just under two ounces. With the extra water from the ice dilution, that is a fookin' massive cocktail. However in *Imbibe* Wondrich states, though I should mention without sources, that the “wine glass” was a standard measurement of two ounces. This would make more sense. I've just had a quick browse through the Old Waldorf, which as a typing-up of a bar notebook contains recipes from across many years, and no recipes have both “wine glass” and “jigger” in them, so like Bruce and Batman are never in the same room, I'm gonna run with Wondrich: ½ a wine-glass is 1oz. The jigger wasn't patented until 1893, way after Johnson's book, which explains why Johnson isn't using it.\n\nAnyway. Wait a minute, it's a damn Martinez! Now wait another minute, maybe it's a just a variation on the Martinez, maybe a small tiny change makes it a different drink. Let's have a real brief look at some Martinez recipes from around that time.\n\nJerry Thomas's 1887 edition of the *Bartender's Guide* says that the Martinez is with two parts vermouth to one part gin, and O.H. Byron's *Modern Bartender's Guide* from 1884 also has a [Manhattan Cocktail No. 1 recipe with two vermouth to one whisky, and the Martinez is: “Same as Manhattan, only you substitute gin for whisky.”](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_n-ydCAKXIA/T1pBM4f9MMI/AAAAAAAAAg0/bhdeCyrjCQ4/s1600/O.H%2BByron.jpg) So perhaps the changing of ratios merits the change in name? Wait, in Byron's Manhattan No. 1 recipe he uses *French* (dry) vermouth. His own “Martinez No. 1” is, with a few fancy additions, actually a honest-to-god gin-and-dry-vermouth Dry Martini with bizarre ratios. Great, now we have two vastly different drinks masquerading under the name “Martinez.” Byron also has a Manhattan Cocktail No. 2 recipe with *Italian* (sweet) vermouth as per what we'd expect, but it's equal parts whisky/vermouth – more variation and no standard recipe.\n\nAdditionally, as we'll see later there's a few Dry Martini recipes in the *Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book* that have different ratios between versions and they don't get a whole new moniker. After so much variation in the Martinez already, being finickity enough to give the drink a new-but-really-close name for having different ratios seems like a bit of a stretch, so...\n\nWait a minute, it's a damn Martinez! Even weirder, [that illustration in Johnson's book isn't captioned as a Martinez but a “Martine.”](http://i.imgur.com/G0A0epU.jpg) Johnson captioned the drawing like the Martinez and the Martini got into the machine from [The Fly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/). When did the Martinez turn into the Martini? Was everybody too drunk to pronounce it?\n\nI can't find any sources prior to Johnson documenting a *recipe* for a Martini. However, back in *Imbibe!* again Wondrich has written that a copy of the *Brooklyn Daily Eagle* in 1887 writes of the “bewildering depths of the 'Martini cocktail'” so the whole misspelling is pre-Johnson. Really interesting is that Wondrich also writes of an article in the *Washington Post* from 1891, that states that the Martini “has” to be made with “the Martini vermuth [sic].” Martini only made red sweet vermouth until 1900. Maybe the whole confusion over the spelling and pronunciation between Martinez and Martini is further complicated by the brand of vermouth, especially if the company's going to jump on the new name for advertising purposes.\n\nAt this point you have to ask yourself, so what if Jean Martini's supposedly favourite drink was genever and white wine? If the Martini cocktail isn't originally a Martini, but then later on becomes what we know now as a Dry Martini, it's highly unlikely that someone's going to go “Oh this is totally only sort of what this French dude's favourite drink was all along, he even has the same name, let's run with that story.” Please.\n\n***\n\n*[continued below]*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400717227", "subreddit": "h_a_tests", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Also, whenever I do cheat the other women know I'm married and I don't hide anything from them besides my identity. I'm not looking to hurt anyones feelings here and have done well in that regard so far. The reasons that I stay married are many but the most important ones are 1. we have 3 happy kids, no need to fuck them up like their parents. 2. Divorce is too expensive 3. Aside from me cheating we are a very happy family. I love my wife but love other women as well. I didn't fully accept this until after we were married and now it is too late to tell her. 4. At the end of the day we got married for the wrong reasons while we were still young and looking back on it we shouldn't have. That doesn't mean that I'm not going to make the best of it while I can.

{"body": "\"Biologist here! Fuck you asshole!\"\n\n/u/Unidan yelled at the cabbie who almost clipped him as he crossed the street. He knew New York cab drivers were jerks but was not quite prepared for this. Being an ornithologist, he promptly flipped him the bird before ducking into Reddit headquarters. He had a very important meeting with /u/yishan today and could not be late. At the door he was greeted by a slender young brunette whose face was thickly slathered in bronzer and eye shadow. She wore a tight periwinkle miniskirt and 6\" heels, and introduced herself to Unidan as /u/cupcake1713.\n\n\"Oi bruv, I'm off me banger on cough medicine. Fancy a swig m8?\" Unidan was taken aback and almost dropped his fanny pack full of fossils and Laffy Taffy. British slags were his fetish, and sweat was already beginning to drip down his chiseled pectorals. Unidan praised Sagan that he wore a dark shirt today that would conceal his body's attempts at [thermoregulation by evaporative cooling.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphoresis)\n\n\"Biologist here! Y-yes please!\" was all he could manage to blurt out without totally collapsing under the weight of his own autism. Cupcake offered him the bottle of Robitussin®.\n\n\"Right m8, I copped this off a trolleyed caffler. Fooookin hell!\" She led him up the stairs towards the offices. Unidan caught a brief glimpse of her light pink underwear as they ascended the staircase. \"You is well fit innit, luv. Right bonable an ting.\" Cupcake winked at Unidan, who was quickly growing pale from all the blood rushing into the [corpus cavernosum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis) of his massive erection. She motioned him towards a door marked \"Supplies.\"\n\n\"Biologist here! I thought yishan was expecting me in the conference room?\"  \n\n\"Well m8 it happens I fink ur a bit of a dish and I wanna feel ur love spuds smashin' against me lettuce. I haven't had me fanny smooshed in fukkin ages!\" Unidan was fully torqued at this point. Cupcake opened the door and pointed towards a furry Snoo costume. \"I got a bit of a kink, luv. Now put it on before I fookin slap your earhole.\" Unidan dutifully complied and began removing his clothing. His 9\" penis flopped out of his pants. \"Blimey you got a biggun!\" yelled a shocked cupcake. Unidan blushed at the compliment. He was one of few humans to posses a [baculum](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/WalrusOosik.jpg) (or *os penis*), which is a bone found in the penis of many placental mammals. This bone aids sexual intercourse by maintaining sufficient stiffness during sexual penetration, and its rare presence in Unidan blessed him with unusual sexual prowess. \n\n\"Biologist here! You know, cupcake, the fusion of two dissimilar gametes in humans is an example of [anisogamy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisogamy), also called heterogamy, and may have evolved because of 'sperm competition'!\" \n\n\"Shut ur gabber and get that custard chucker up me vertical [bacon sarnie.](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01298/bacon-sandwich_1298224c.jpg)\" Cupcake turned around, lifted her skirt, and presented her butt to Unidan who was chomping at the bit to deposit his gametes into cupcake for the sole purpose of procreation. Unidan put on the Snoo helmet and gently entered cupcake.\n\n\"None of this limp-wristed shite, ya poofter! Get innit an don't stop till you glob all over me growler. An don't forget to rub me bloody Bristol cities, me knockers are as soft as [bubble and squeak.](http://p-ec1.pixstatic.com/5069fa16fb04d60a47000a19._w.540_h.405_s.fit_.jpg)\" Unidan fondled cupcake's mammary glands and started pumping, but all this chav talk was so hot that it wasn't long before he could feel a mighty eruption gathering in his prostate.\n\n\"Biologist here! FUCK I'M GONNA CUM!!!\"\n\n\"Shove that womb-broom up me arse and spunk in me shitbox, luv\" Unidan fumbled a bit but was eventually able to fit all 9 inches into the terminus of cupcake's digestive tract. \"Fukkin hell you spacka, watch how hard ur shoving it or ur gonna give me piles!\" But it was too late, and Unidan couldn't stop it. He should have listened.\n\n\"Biologist here! [IT'S HAPPENING!!!](http://i.imgur.com/OgJzfPM.gif)\" Unidan moaned as wave after wave of pleasure consumed his body. This sensation was a form of neuromuscular euphoria, and boy was he [euphoric](http://i.imgur.com/COmaCjJ.jpg). Eventually he pulled out and started putting on his clothes as cupcake fixed her hair.\n\n\"That woz proppa good m8 innit. Next time, knock me top bollocks around a bit then yeah?\" Unidan's heart skipped a beat when cupcake said \"next time.\" Maybe he would finally get a girlfriend?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400885369", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah, I just took this, and it's really nowhere near as bad as people make it seem. If you're willing to put in even a moderate amount of effort, you'll be fine.\n\n\nHere's what I tell people when they ask about the class.\n\n\nIt's curved so it's really near impossible to fail. A 55% was a passing grade, and I think an 80 or 85 was an A. On top of that the breakdown was 40 points homework and quizzes, and 60 points for all of the exams combined.\n\n\nThe quizzes aren't all too difficult, but the homework was kind of a cheeky cunt. Ask around, my buddy found a solution manual and it made the process so much easier. If you do all of the homework and do somewhat well on the quizzes, you can easily get near or the entirety of the 40 points (which is curved as well, but 40 points maximum). Right there, all you need is 15 TOTAL points across three exams to pass.\n\n\nThe attendance points for my section were completely extra credit, and it was up to 5 additional points depending on your score. I think I had a 54% or something (I skipped a lot, 8 am was not a friend of mine). Thst brings you down to 10 points total on three exams, and realistically if you're OKAY at physics and kinda understand the material, you can easily average 10 points per exam. They're difficult, but 10 points is probably a little below average (not by much though), and you can still get by on that.\n\n\nSeriously though, just attend the lectures and pay attention. A lot of times, the professor(s) will show you homework problems because they are that tough, and they do a pretty good job of explaining how to solve each type of problem, and more often than not, those problems will appear on the exams. Use office hours to your advantage, and it'll be a piece of cake.\n\n\nGetting an A, that's hard. Passing?

I can't remember the last time that happened.\n\n&gt;Deception #4 is exactly what /u/BipolarBear0 did to probe /r/conspiracy,\n\nHeh, I remember that.\n\n&gt;and I don't think that was exactly kosher.\n\nI saw what you did there...u r 1 cheeky cunt m8.\n\nBut seriously though, while BipolarBear0's methods may have been suspect, but it's hard for me to feel any sympathy for the /r/conspiracy crowd, for reasons which by now should be obvious.\n\n&gt;&gt;But IMHO, intellectual dishonesty deserves to be called out at least as much as bigotry does.\n\n&gt;Maybe, but it's sometimes hard to distinguish dishonesty from general fuzziness.\n\nIt *can* be difficult to distinguish the two, but it is not always.  There are ways to determine when a person is lying, and often it boils down to determining both the knowledge and the intent of the speaker - in other words, whether the speaker is A) deliberately propagating falsehood, B) speaking without regard to truth (i.e. bullshitting), or C) genuinely ignorant.\n\nThere is no simple formula or algorithm to use in making such a determination.  It requires experience, intuition, background knowledge, and a good deal of luck.  But lawyers, judges, and law enforcement personnel have to do this every day.  It is but one of the many things which makes work in the legal profession so stressful.\n\nI would like to believe that I've got a pretty finely-tuned bullshit detector at this point.  But everyone guesses wrong and gets fooled once in a while.  In this particular instance, the admins had access to information (such as IP logs and other sysadmin tools) which enabled them to spot the deception.  The rest of us could only rely on intuition and any other clues which could be gleaned second- or third-hand...which is why I think you are right on the money for saying that it is good that this was documented.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401093293", "subreddit": "antisrs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had the same thing happen, my friend was driving my car while drunk (i think he blew a .10) i was probably a .28 at the time.  My buddy gets hauled off, then they toss me my keys and tell me to have a good night.  wot m8?  This was on a freaking interstate, i'm sure they just wanted me to drive away so they could pull me over.  I called a mate who i knew was sober to come get me an my car.  Cops still tailed him the whole way.\n\nHere's how it went down: Drive older \"wiser\" friend out to a bar doing \"service industry night\" If you can prove you work as a server you get $1 droughts.  Proceed to drink way more than is should.  I drink 3 for every one of his drinks.  I was drinking yuengling, he was drinking miller or bud light.  I pound beers like no one's business.  It's time to leave so i let him have my keys (i'm drunk and he's not had many compared to me).  He does 45 in a 35 on and gets on the interstate.  We'd already crossed the county line, and the city line.  Pulled over by blinky blue lights, and i couldn't have told you if they were the right ones for that part of the interstate.  They were very polite, asked me and my buddy a bunch of questions like \"what's in the car\".  My buddy had no idea if i had anything in the car (i didn't) and deferred to me.  I'm drunkenly inviting them to see what's in my pockets because they asked if i had any weapons.  \"do you have anything we should know about\" was asked to me. I told them, if they were looking for weapons, then there were some BB guns in the trunk, but no BBs.   Finally they ask my buddy why he was driving and he tells the police that if he didn't drive i would have killed someone.    Then they still leave me with my car and keys on the side of a 65MPH interstate.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401142406", "subreddit": "news", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm 21 now, I first started to suspect I had ADD aged around 14, went to the doctor with it, got waved away (apparently not bouncing off the walls and having good grades precludes someone from having ADD- WHO KNEW).\n\nEntered first year of uni already slightly depressed, but it got worse and worse until I had no choice but to either see someone about it, or not see anyone ever again, if you catch my drift. Was referred to a counsellor who said I seemed to have had depression, but also something else. She couldn't officially diagnose what it was, as she wasn't allowed to diagnose (she was a counsellor, not a psychologist/psychiatrist/doctor), so I got referred to a psychologist.\n\n6 months or so later, I finally see her. She asks a load of questions without explaining what they mean, and so, for instance when she asked about whether I was impulsive, I said no, but had she explained what she meant by impulsive, I would have said yes.\n\nSo 3 months later she sends me to CBT. Unfortunately, the CBT therapist I had was fooking awful, and refused to allow me to see a psychiatrist in conjunction with her, as according to her, CBT and medication are an either/or deal (**it's not, and if someone tells you this, find another therapist**). Due to school commitments and illness (the former I let her know about in advance), I missed three sessions (non consecutively) and my treatment was terminated.\n\nSo I was left on my own. I figured I'd wait until I got home that summer, which was about 4-5 months away, but because of waiting lists etc, I wasn't able to see a psychiatrist. 2-3 months after that (so far: 1 year and 9 months since I started seeking help), I saw another doctor, but she said exactly the same as my doctor at 14 said, only without the good grades bit (I was tanking in my second year of uni).\n\nSo I waited, and figured I was now entirely on my own. My girlfriend however, a psychologist in training, forced me to see another doctor about this. I did, and good god, she referred me to a psychiatrist! I'd just have to wait for a letter, and I'd be seeing him in about 6-8 weeks. I waited. And waited. After 7 weeks of waiting, I called the psychiatrist's office. He wasn't in. For the next 3-4 weeks I called nearly every weekday. Either he wasn't in, or his secretary wasn't in, or some other shit. Eventually, due to dissertation dates, finals, and a run in the student elections, I gave up again.\n\nIt is now 2 years and 4.5 months since I first sought help. Still waiting.\n\nWith the exception of my very supportive gf, I've been on my own. I've tried self-medicating (summary bellow), meditation (works very well), changing my diet (slow carb works for me), exercise (one of the best, but hard as hell to habit-form, and not succeeded yet), and several others which had no effect. THe combined result is that I can when I need to, albeit at horrible cost to my blood pressure and muscles (caffeine jitters + no mobility practice = PAIN)\n\nI know I need help, and I'm sure you do too, so do hang in there. But as your eventual help with tell you, they won't fix you for you. They will guide, and carry you over the bits you can't do yourself, but there is still a lot you can start doing now. At some point I'm going to write all that helped and hindered me properly, because I wasted 2 (very important) years of my life battling shit I didn't have to do, and I wouldn't want others to do the same.\n\nStay strong, friend, you will win.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**self-medication summary**\n\n\n* Nicotine (gum. Don't be a gibbon and start smoking) - Mild positive effect, affects ability to sleep however\n* Caffeine - yes, but addiction is easier than you think, and in excess affects blood pressure\n* Ginko - Turned my shits into the size and consistency of your average skyscraper. Works, but sleep and arsehole were heavily affected.\n* Omega 3 - Yes, works, and a no brainer. The one a day stuff however doesn't contain enough of the good stuff to work. I don't have room here to give a full explanation, but there's plenty of stuff out there.\n* Resveratrol - Not been able to perform a control, but seems to work a bit.

{"body": "###Not Cocktail of the Week #73: Dry Martini\n\nWhere to start on the Dry Martini? Of all the 'classics' in the fluid world of mixed drinks, few are as famous, enticing, but seemingly unapproachable. Few are as instantly associated with the word 'cocktail' but simultaneously seldom ordered at the bar. Few have lent their name to so many related and unrelated drinks. And most certainly, few have as many variations or personal touches on a pretty steadfast and simple concept as the Martini.\n\n***\n\n###\"Martini\"\n\nWait, I *say* Martini. I mean Dry Martini. In some old books they're two different drinks. But these days? If you ask for a Martini, your bartender's not going to ask you between “classic” or “dry.” They'll most likely ask “gin or vodka?” If you ask me for a “Dry Martini,” I'll probably think you want a Dry Martini, you're just calling it a “Martini” and you're specifying it to be “dry” – a high ratio of gin to vermouth. If you wanted a “Martini” that wasn't so dry you would have said something like “Can I have a Martini, but pretty wet please,” because everybody knows that a wet Martini is just a Dry Martini but with a lot of dry vermouth, right?\n\nPerhaps I've sipped more than I can gulp. Let's start at the top. There's a lot of scattershot information out there, a lot of sources and a lot of already very-well-written literature on the background of the Martini, and I'm going to try and put together the most comprehensive but accessible introduction I can.\n\nFor this reason, I'm going to break a little tradition for this week. I'm going to mash the *Background* and *Recipes* sections together and instead split the sections up into the different connected history and recipes. The evolution of the drink, from its humble beginnings as a twist on a twist to the uncertainty of each personal recipe during the contemporary cocktail revival movement, is crucial to your own preferred version as well. There's absolutely no *wrong* way to make a Dry Martini. Your favourite matches with a certain point in time through the drink history. I'll make comments about each recipe and their place in history as we go along.\n\nFirst, let's start with a quick look at the “Martini” before we rush into the “Dry”ness.\n\n***\n\n###Primordial Booze – The Origins \n\nFor chronology's sake, I should note a story from *Shaken Not Stirred, A Celebration Of The Martini*. I'm paraphrasing this, going on someone else's word that it's in the book, so bear with me. Apparently Johann Paul Aegius Schwartzendorf (1741-1816), a Bavarian composer, emigrated to France in 1758. He changed his name to Jean Paul Aegide Martini, perhaps because Italian composers were “in” and he wanted some of the action. According to a biographical account – of which I can't find any source – his favorite drink was gin and white wine. Supposedly Martini's popularity made other customers order his drink by his name, and then emigrating French drinkers would start using the word in America.\n\nThis story seems very shaky (not stirry) and not backed up by anything. At that time, Martini wouldn't have even been drinking what we call gin, but genever, as what we know as gin today didn't exist back then. You need a neutral spirit to distill our version of gin, and the column still that made the production of neutral spirit practical wasn't developed until the 1820s, after Martini's death. At least this tale provides us one little fact: the word Martini is in the common lexicon before the drink starts appearing. It's a popular name. But then, we knew that: There's been bottles of vermouth with the word Martini on them since 1863.\n\nThe main general theory is that “Martini” is a bastardization of the word “Martinez,” which if both words are being spoken in the world around the same time, isn't that much of a stretch. Martinez in a French accent is “Mar-ti-ney,” obviously close to Martini. It's not only easy to imagine a lost-in-accentuation, mispronounced word turning into a new noun when a drink starts to change over time, it's actually pretty documented. David Wondrich notes in *Imbibe!* that there was a Judge by the name of Martine kicking around in the Manhattan Club in the mid-1800s and his name might have something to do with the Martinez, the Martini, both, or the change from one to the other, but to cut a long story short it's a stretch of a theory. Let's just have a look at the Martinez first.\n\nThe basic ideas of the Martinez and Martini look pretty similar. Briefly check out the [NCotW on the Martinez](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ck6v2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_15_martinez/) and you can see that by 1887 when Jerry Thomas's second edition of the *Bartender's Guide* comes out (two years after his death – presumably the finished manuscript was buried hidden under a pile of waistcoats, bow ties and tins of mustache wax) the Martinez is essentially a twist on a Manhattan. You substitute a sweet and spicy whiskey for sweet and botanical gin and voila, new drink. The recipe concept of the time is essentially: a reasonably sweet “Old Tom” gin, sweet vermouth, a modifier if desired (maraschino liqueur most often) and a dash of bitters.\n\nThen just one year later in 1888, Harry Johnson's *Bartender's Manual* is published and includes a recipe for a “Martini:”\n\n*Bartender's Manual*, Harry Johnson, 1888\n&gt;\n&gt;**Martini Cocktail**  \n&gt;Fill up the glass with ice;  \n&gt;2 or 3 dashes of gum syrup (be careful in not using too much);  \n&gt;2 or 3 dashes of bitters (Boker's genuine only);  \n&gt;1 dash of curaçao or absinthe, if required;  \n&gt; ½ wine-glass of old Tom gin;  \n&gt; ½ wine-glass of vermouth.  \n&gt;Stir up well with a spoon; strain it into a fancy cocktail glass; put in a cherry or a medium-sized olive, if required; and squeeze a piece of lemon peel on top, and serve (see illustration, plate No. 13).  \n&gt; *– Harry Johnson, Bartender's Manual*\n\nAlso in Henry J. Wehmann's *Bartenders Guide* of 1891, his “Martini” recipe is identical but for the omission of the optional absinthe.\n\nIn the *Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book* the author describes a “Claret” wine glass as holding between three and a half to four ounces, so half a wine-glass would be just under two ounces. With the extra water from the ice dilution, that is a fookin' massive cocktail. However in *Imbibe* Wondrich states, though I should mention without sources, that the “wine glass” was a standard measurement of two ounces. This would make more sense. I've just had a quick browse through the Old Waldorf, which as a typing-up of a bar notebook contains recipes from across many years, and no recipes have both “wine glass” and “jigger” in them, so like Bruce and Batman are never in the same room, I'm gonna run with Wondrich: ½ a wine-glass is 1oz. The jigger wasn't patented until 1893, way after Johnson's book, which explains why Johnson isn't using it.\n\nAnyway. Wait a minute, it's a damn Martinez! Now wait another minute, maybe it's a just a variation on the Martinez, maybe a small tiny change makes it a different drink. Let's have a real brief look at some Martinez recipes from around that time.\n\nJerry Thomas's 1887 edition of the *Bartender's Guide* says that the Martinez is with two parts vermouth to one part gin, and O.H. Byron's *Modern Bartender's Guide* from 1884 also has a [Manhattan Cocktail No. 1 recipe with two vermouth to one whisky, and the Martinez is: “Same as Manhattan, only you substitute gin for whisky.”](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_n-ydCAKXIA/T1pBM4f9MMI/AAAAAAAAAg0/bhdeCyrjCQ4/s1600/O.H%2BByron.jpg) So perhaps the changing of ratios merits the change in name? Wait, in Byron's Manhattan No. 1 recipe he uses *French* (dry) vermouth. His own “Martinez No. 1” is, with a few fancy additions, actually a honest-to-god gin-and-dry-vermouth Dry Martini with bizarre ratios. Great, now we have two vastly different drinks masquerading under the name “Martinez.” Byron also has a Manhattan Cocktail No. 2 recipe with *Italian* (sweet) vermouth as per what we'd expect, but it's equal parts whisky/vermouth – more variation and no standard recipe.\n\nAdditionally, as we'll see later there's a few Dry Martini recipes in the *Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book* that have different ratios between versions and they don't get a whole new moniker. After so much variation in the Martinez already, being finickity enough to give the drink a new-but-really-close name for having different ratios seems like a bit of a stretch, so...\n\nWait a minute, it's a damn Martinez! Even weirder, [that illustration in Johnson's book isn't captioned as a Martinez but a “Martine.”](http://i.imgur.com/G0A0epU.jpg) Johnson captioned the drawing like the Martinez and the Martini got into the machine from [The Fly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/). When did the Martinez turn into the Martini? Was everybody too drunk to pronounce it?\n\nI can't find any sources prior to Johnson documenting a *recipe* for a Martini. However, back in *Imbibe!* again Wondrich has written that a copy of the *Brooklyn Daily Eagle* in 1887 writes of the “bewildering depths of the 'Martini cocktail'” so the whole misspelling is pre-Johnson. Really interesting is that Wondrich also writes of an article in the *Washington Post* from 1891, that states that the Martini “has” to be made with “the Martini vermuth [sic].” Martini only made red sweet vermouth until 1900. Maybe the whole confusion over the spelling and pronunciation between Martinez and Martini is further complicated by the brand of vermouth, especially if the company's going to jump on the new name for advertising purposes.\n\n***\n\n*[continued below]*", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1401286667", "subreddit": "cocktails", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

Beginning in 1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin. In 1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital city Monrovia after James Monroe.\n\n&gt; Ethiopia derived prestige for its uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa, and subsequently many African nations adopted the colors of Ethiopia's flag following their independence. Ethiopia was the only African country to defeat a European colonial power and retain its sovereignty as an independent country.[18][19][20] It was the first independent African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the UN.[21] In 1974, at the end of Haile Selassie I's reign, power fell to a communist military junta known as the Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it was defeated by the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the collapse of the USSR in 1991.\n\nAnd they haven't gone through half the shit the baltics have, yet they don't live in mud huts..

{"body": "/language\n\nThe heat shimmered and moved in waves down the dirty main street kicking up small dust devils and pieces of old trash between the broken down cars and smashed storefront windows.  Ferguson leaned against the warm, rough wall and dabbed his sweaty forehead with the neatly folded handkerchief before he caught himself and hastily jammed it back in his rumpled, torn Members Only jacket.  He pulled a dirty, frayed sleeve across his forehead to wipe away the sweat.\n\n“Authentic”, he thought, admiring his filthy reflection in the broken store window.  Ripped, faded jeans hung loosely off his waist, a grease stained shirt tail stuck out at his belt, neither of his shoes had laces, a thick gold chain dangled about his neck, and a John Deere gimme-hat was jammed backwards on his greasy head.  The smells of alcohol, drugs, and poor life decisions flowed around him like a sickness.  “How could people live like this?”\n\nFerguson continued to pick his way down the trash and debris strewn street, an old woman in immaculate evening attire leaned against the smouldering hulk of an old Oldsmobile. “Bitch muthafuka get that shit down my friend makes $5000 a week at home ask me how.  HOW!”, she spit at him, taking a long, slow draw on a long blunt.\n\n“I … uh … what the shitty fuck is up with your Dora shit posting kids dude?”, he caught himself and shot back, but she had already lost interest and wandered further down a side street.  “You are soo sooo stoopid”, he heard her yell at a fire hydrant, “L M F A O BEIBER FEREVER!”, before continued out of site.\n\nHis nerves frayed, Ferguson ducked into an empty storefront.  Stepping over the door half off its hinges, “7-Eleven” still barely visible on the dirty glass.  Shelves sat empty except for piles of blowing dust, broken glass and more trash covered the floor, the ceiling show signs of a fire at some point, and the occasional drips of water echoed somewhere deeper inside.  His shaking hand pulled the flask from his jacket and took a long sip.  And nearly dropped it when the voice echoed out, “First! That looks hawt! Where’s mine UR A GHEY??!”\n\nStarting back and stumbling, Ferguson caught himself hard, knocking a shelf over crashing onto the floor.  Mice and trash skittered away.  In the darkness he could make out at least half a dozen people.  One repeatedly smashed his head into the wall, “First!”, called the familiar voice.  The others sat or lay on the ground, mumbling incoherently, “ZOMG F@G”, “Fooking prawn!”, “I love this”, “Shut the fuck up”.  The mumbled chants grew louder and louder.\n\nHe ran.  He ran into the blazing heat.  He ran and he didn’t look back.  His chest heaved and burned, and he ran.  He ran until he stumbled and fell exhausted, kicking up another cloud of whirling dust at the edge of town.\n\nFerguson fumbled madly at his jacket, pulling out a small metal device with a flashing red light, “Control.  This is Ferguson.  Immediate extraction.  Repeat”, he drew deep, dusty breaths, “repeat, immediate extraction.  Long term exposure has resulted in chronic, debilitating brain damage.”  He got to his knees, “Recommend dust off and nuke from orbit.  It’s the only way to be sure.  Ferguson, out.”\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401487094", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It's why my Warrior (who's 564, by the way, from, oh, whaddaya know, guild raids) still has 3 pieces of Prideful gear. Because of shitty luck on drops from various sources. All three of them are offset, but still. Prideful gear IS good and good raiding guilds DO encourage you to get it if you have shitty luck with drops. (I haven't seen a single normal bracer, neck, or second ring in any of my normal runs, and I'm doing at least 10/14 every week.)\n\nAs a PvE player, Prideful gear is there to shore up your PvE gear, not to replace it.

{"body": "(WARNING: All Spoilers are major for upcoming episodes and A Storm of Swords, but they are marked)\n\n\nIn their respective primes, I'd rank all the contenders OP listed as,\n\n1. Barristan Selmy- The consensus best warrior in the time period of the books and show. His list of achievements in his Lord Commander of The Kingsguard biography in ASOS is staggering. In the books the only historical figures I would put above him would be Aemon the Dragonknight and Azor Azhai, possibly the sword of the morning.\n\n2. The Mountain- Maybe not the best fighter out of the rest, but his size just absolutely dominates. In the books he's described as eight feet tall and over 400 pounds, and the only person to [Major Tv/ASOS Spoilers](#b \"defeat him and survive was Loras Tyrell at the Tourney of the Hand. He also killed Beric Dondarrion twice, and strangled the Red Viper to death after taking multiple wounds with a poison spear.\") He's close to nonhuman, and pretty much unstoppable.\n\n3. Khal Drogo- I almost put him second, but we don't see enough of him in the books or the show. What we do know is that he is the undisputed alpha of a monstrously large Dothraki hoard, and that he has never been defeated in battle in his entire life. As Daenerys says (paraphrased), [AGOT](#b \"He died with his braid uncut, a feat few men achieve\") \n\n4. Jaimie Lannister- Consensus best swordsman in the seven kingdoms during the time period of the show. Swordplay isn't everything, but it is really significant. Barristan was probably better in his prime, but given his age and Jaimie's youth, the two-handed Lannister would likely defeat him. Also the youngest person ever to take the vows of the Kingsguard, which is pretty badass.\n\n5. Syrio Forrel- In his prime he was undoubtably the best swordsman in Braavos, or at least he claims. Ned seems to believe him, as I doubt he would pick someone unworthy to train Arya. He also held off Meryn Trant, a skilled swordsmen in his own right, and three other fully armored men with a stick long enough for Arya to escape. Almost enough to put him ahead of Jaime, but we don't know any of the things he did in Essos so it's hard to judge.\n\n6. Robert- In his prime he ended the only dynasty Westeros had ever known and killed the Last Dragon Rhaegor Targaryen in single combat at the Battle of the Trident. Similar to The Mountain in that his size aided him greatly, but from what we know Robert was a ferocious warrior in his youth.\n\n7. Jorah, Grey Worm, and Daario- I don't like lumping them together, but I understand why OP did it in relation to the show. Jorah brings their rank down pretty hard. He's respectable, but he's more comparable to someone like Bronn then these two. Daario is the leader of the Seconds Sons/Stormcrows, while Grey Worm the unsullied. Like Khal Drogo, we don't see many direct feats of strength or prowess from these two, but the fact that they were able to rise to thank rank should speak volumes. \n\n8. Oberyn Martell- He's called the Red Viper for a reason, and his rank falls in my list because he relies on poison so heavily. He is undoubtably deadly with a spear, and he has a reputation of one of the best fighters in Dorne. [Major TV/ASOS Spoilers](#b \"He dies at the hands of the Mountain, but his showing in the duel is a major reason he's ranked so high. If it were any other man in Westeros, the Viper would have won easily\") \n\n9. Ned- Similar to Robert in that he's a little washed up in the time period of the books and show, but at least in the show he holds his own against Jaime for a while. His feats during Robert's Rebellion gained him respect as a warrior, and him and Howland Reed were the only ones to survive the mysterious bloodbath in the Tower of Joy. \n\n10. Brienne- She has a major advantage in that most of her opponents take her for granted before and during a fight because she is female. She is huge for her sex, and very strong. Defeated Loras Tyrell in front of King Renly, and was able to wound a two-handed Jaime while trying to escort him to King's Landing. Had her below the Hound in my mind, but after writing this I had to move her up. \n\n11. Sandor Clegane- Major weakness in his fear of fire. It made him desert the Blackwater, and someone as small as Arya could reduce him to whimper with just a torch. Also has played second fiddle to Gregor his whole life. He's definitely a powerful soldier, but he needed Arya's help just to kill the Tickler and Polliver in that inn. In his prime, which I would argue is during the show and books, he doesn't really compare to those above him.\n\n12. Bronn- Like the Red Viper, he fights pretty dirty. Talks a lot of talk, but the only walk he really does is defeating a Knight of the Vale during Tyrion's first trial by combat. He fought at the Blackwater, but we don't really see him do anything amazing. He's knighted afterwards, but so was nearly everyone else who survived the battle. Not bad, but not anything really special.\n\n13. Ramsay- Put him above Jon Snow just based on the show, as in the books he really doesn't do anything. The scene with the Greyjoy's in undoubtably badass, but I kinda agree that the show version of the Greyjoy's pretty much suck at everything. Still, Asha is supposed to be formidable and he pretty much made her give up after being so determined so theres that.\n\n14. Jon Snow- Like OP said, Jon needed help from wolves to win pretty much every major conflict he's been in. In the books he [Major TV/ASOS](#b \"defends Castle Black against the Thenns and Wildlings with just a handful of defenders, so that's significant.\"). His prowess at Castle Black during training pretty much means nothing, as he had been training with a sword and a master at arms since he could hold one.\n\n15.
