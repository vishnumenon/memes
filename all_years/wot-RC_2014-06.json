Everything was all fucking fine and dandy! And then on his first fucking day on the stream /u/Elsaccount called me junjhup and that caught on like fucking wildfire. Soon more people called me junjhup instead of vinjhup so I changed my name. Then everything was all fine and dandy for like a week afterwards until Kristoff (I think, the history's getting kinda blurry) called me jupjup in a Cards Against Humanity game. I made the mistake of saying \"I like it. The name seems kinda like tribal and shit\", I'm paraphrasing of course and then *that* name caught on so I changed my name *again*. This is where it starts to get kinda weird. So, once again the next name change was Kristoff's fault in, once again, a Cards Against Humanity game. He called me.....kupkup. To be fair he was pretty fucking sick (like literally) so I let it slide. Then I doomed myself by saying something along the lines of \"It kinda sounds like the word cupcake.\" Of course I didn't change my name to cupcake because fuck that. I changed it to jupcake instead. Now we fastforward to like three days ago. Fucking Kuer wanted me to change my name djupdjup for reasons that will take too long to describe right now and I obviously did not want that. So what does he do? He makes a poll, makes it all democratic and shit. And the majority of people voted for me to change my name. **But**, being the cheeky little cunt I am I didn't change it to djupdjup. No. I changed it to djupcake. And now we're here and *hopefully* I don't need to change my name again. Like forever.

{"body": "**This.**\n\nI think this subreddit has taken a plunge in overall quality. There are a ton of shit posts that make it to the front page (and a LOT that don't, thankfully :D), but I know that's going to happen to any subreddit that gains popularity. Am I glad we've gained so much attention? Yes, of course. More people to create videos and more people who can watch our content. There's also a lot of people who just need to sit back and watch the videos and come up with something original and creative before just watching some of the front-paged videos and making one in an hour themselves.\n\nThank you for referencing me in the video, too. I do find it annoying as fuck when people spam my twitter and ask.fm with stupid jokes that are only funny when in the right context. It worries me that we are supposed to be parodying the people who are rampant and crazy over videos and tend to get out of hand with certain creators and video styles, yet we are becoming those people. \n\nEven though we are technically a circlejerk subreddit, sometimes seeing \"good vid m8 wont shank ur nan/10\" gets really fucking old after the ten times it's posted. If you have criticism (constructive or not), please post it. It's something we can all use to improve future content.\n\nHere's how we can improve and keep this place good:\n\n - Push the use of /r/allthingsmlg too. Only parodies should be allowed here, and resources and things like your speedart should be posted to /r/allthingsmlg. \n\n - Open up contests again. God, those were the best and I have no idea why we got rid of them. Back then I remember there wasn't nearly as many participants as there would be now, and I think we need to try at least once and see how it goes.\n\n - As /u/ThatParanoidPenguin said, tagging. Tagging posts with [movie], [game], etc. could really be beneficial to people who want to see a specific style of subreddit. He better explains it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/montageparodies/comments/275fwb/important_announcement_for_fans_of_montage/chxm3x8).\n\n - Moderation. If you see a post that clearly does not belong here, remove it. If a post violates the very little amount of rules we have here, remove it. I don't want a lot of rules, but enforce the ones we do have, like having resources and suggestions in text posts. \n\nI love this subreddit and it's what I've based my channel on. I don't want to see it go to waste, but I've ignored it for a long time because of the \"jokes\" that people have told me on my twitter and ask.fm that should only be in videos such as \"u wot m8 1v1 me m9 ill shank ur nan\" as well as the surprising amount of bad videos I've seen on the front page that only get upvoted because of their contextual humor. \n\nJust needed to get this off my chest.

{"body": "Rob was never a good king. He broke his promise and married some girl he met showing what a promise means to him. He killed one of his banner men for doing justice. He allowed his mother to free the only real hostage he had. He was dependent on his mothers and other bannermen to rule and fight (especially Bolton). He had less soldiers than the Lannisters. Short he was inescapable, to fight, rule, make his men obey him, give out orders and he wasn't trustworthy. \n\nNow to the Walder side: he gave that boy free pass threw the twins and 4000 men + a few of his own sons and other family members. Without Walder he would loose right there and wouldn't be able to save the Riverlands capital and other lords. For all this he wanted only a few things, That Rob marries one of his daughters or granddaughters he could chose which, that Arya marries his youngest son. That he takes two of his male offspring to Winterfell as wards and another one as Squire. Not much is it? Especially for what he got. Rob betrayed the pact, and cheated him. He most likely wouldn't mind if he took his woman as misters or his Frey wife had an \"accident\" shortly after. He knew rob is a ass to bet on in a horse race. He was a bad king as stated above. The North was invaded by the iroborn, they were short on men and supplies. And he Had to deal with the fooking Tywin Lannister... you know what that means? A Lanister always pays his debts and Hear our roar. The Lannisters are rich, they army is loyal, they have more soldiers and the king on their side. Tywin is a great politician, good at strategy, a amazing battle commander and most likely would pay back every lord who was fighting for the north. Simply Walder had countless reasons to switch sides. But how could he do it? simply he had to kill the uprising. And there is an opportunity, Rob has the cheek to show actually come to the wedding... with his wife. Of course he takes it. \n\nIt is quite brutal, he disobeyed the guest right which is a big affront but in the end he saved himself, the Frey's, secured a position for him, probably saved the country and thousands of people.

They are on a slump as of now.

Either way SHC is one of few teams to score consistently so far with each player averaging a higher PPG than most players. \n\nFinally I want to emphasize how much the writer does not use any fantasy logic but rather uses team performance.

Its l33t-style shorthand form “M8” has been used in IRC channels and instant messaging since the 1990s.

At least up until the Vietnam war, if not later? You see *hundreds* of instances of Americans fighting for justice and progressive policies using the American political system.

Since we live in a time where Americans are opening up to the \"victimless crime\" aspect of recreational drug use? Since we live in a time where Americans are less likely to vote based on racial/gender lines? Less based on religion or dogmatic thinking?\n\nI think it's unfair to bemoan the death of American democracy. \n\nThe SCOTUS is a bizarre and confusing thing.

There are something like 1.5 million ranked solo queue players. If you consider that each one will play three ranked games a day (which is definitely an over-exaggeration, the vast majority of play is non-ranked), that is equal to 150,000 (10 players to a game) * 3 = 450,000 games of League a day. At 10MB per replay, you're looking at 4.5 Terabytes of storage per day. \n\nWith Google/Amazon cloud storage services currently sitting at $0.025 per GB, you're talking about a growth rate of US$112.5 per day (if you want to keep all files online in perpetuity, in reality you can say that replay files that haven't been downloaded in a month will be deleted, replay files that have been viewed even a single time will be kept forever).\n\nSo for about five thousand dollars you could have the cloud storage to get replays up and running *today* for all ranked games. \n\nThen release a camera ward skin, or a \"replay battle boost\", or any other monetization stream to fund the replay system's public, live release.\n\nCongratulations, you just implemented a sought after product which has been finished for years. Without any new infrastructure purchases by Riot. And it's not only working, it's making you money.

{"body": "That looks like a ginseng ficus. Now, they look really cool with the huge trunks but most people here will say that that's bit bonsai and  that you wot be able to make it look any better. But what you can do is use this to learn how to water and learn good watering and fertilizing habits with this tree. I.e checking the soil everyday and fertilizing every week with half strength fertilizer. Also something else you should do is look up any bonsai nurseries or clubs in your area for new material that will be trainable and more interesting to look at and learn with.  Also, I am glad to see that you know that trees SHOULD be kept outside if the temp and species wants it to be and if the climate is right. While this species will live indoors it will thrive much more outside. I'm not too sure about your climate or housing situation as that can prevent many people from having a bonsai tree.(apartments with not a balcony can be an issue).  Also to help us help you fill in your flair to help us know your area and climate and read the side bar.

{"body": "About half are OK and tolerable in my opinion. \n\nENFP: least favorite type. I just can't take their boundless joy and zest. Joy and enthusiasm are good, but the ENFPs have an unhealthy amount of it. Also, I really dislike their \"LOL I R QUIRKY\" and their penchant for activism. \n\nINFP: same as the ENFPs, but at least they have great writers. Stick to writing, and we'll get along just fine. \n\nESTP: don't get the hate on them. probably stems from the ESTPs being the stereotypical jocks and picking on the INTP and INTJs of the world. Perfect for great times and having fun. Just not for extended periods of time. \n\nISTP: never met one. shame, though\n\nINTJ: Have an INTJ best friend. Enjoyable some to most of the time. Has a penchant to say the \"u wot m8\" copypasta and doge quotes all the time, which is annoying as fuck. Not fun necessarily, but fun to compete with. \n\nENFJ: Teacher is one. Loves all of us, but likes me the least for my penchant to call out illogical statements and say exactly what is on my mind. On an essay where we had to state whether or not Romeo and Juliet was a tragedy or not based on Aristotle's (I think) definition of a tragedy, did not appreciate my logic based decision and told me to dig deeper.\n\nINFJ: dislike them because of their champion complex. Really, any NF or person who is holier-than-thou or goody-two-shoes, I dislike. They just rub me wrong.\n\nENTP: Have an ENTP best friend. Doesn't do anything until the last minute. And it shows. I at least do it well when I do it at the last minute. Entertaining, but unusually always quotes the same old jokes, which seems off for someone that represses a function that loves old jokes. So, they're ok. Like most of the types. \n\nThe rest are OK.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402180855", "subreddit": "mbti", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "But the thing is, his character isn't supposed to be portrayed as a 1 on 1 badass. If you want a 1 on 1 badass, you got guys like Drogo and Oberyn. Jon Snow is an above average fighter and hes portrayed as that perfectly. Look at Ned, a lot of fans wished that King's Guard guy hadn't stabbed Ned, but every book reader knew that if Ned kept fighting Jaime, he would've been killed. While great fighters, Ned and Jon aren't among the top tier, so it would be silly to have Jon completely overpower his opponents, especially when it's people like Karl Tanner and the Thenn leader.\n\nYour really underestimating \"the fookin legend\" and especially the Thenn leader. Sure Jon is well trained, and he held his own against Karl Tanner despite trying to swing a longsword indoors. I'd say Tanner is also above average so it's not like Jon really has a huge advantage against this guy, and he really only lost because he didn't expect his opponent to spit in his eyes and knock his groin. Sure that's his fault, but he learned from it. \n\nThe Thenn leader is a whole other story, that guy was definitely favored against Jon. Knight training since birth doesn't equate to training in actual combat, and the Thenn leader has infinitely more combat experience than Jon Snow. Who cares if he was really good in training, the Thenn leader has been fighting and killing probably since he was a kid. Also taking into account that he's way stronger than Jon physically and has a foot in height on him, I think Jon did fine.\n\nI know this is kinda wordy, but I see so many people complain about stuff like this, when I think the show is just being realistic to his character.

{"body": "There was a pretty good post here a while back which predicted these two would meet for a while.  The big difference between the show and the book is when Brienne met Hot Pie and he told her Arya is alive.  At that moment Brienne and Pod go down the road towards the Eyrie, hoping to find Arya there.  There's also the conversation between Brienne and Pod about where Arya would go, and Pod says Lysa is her closest living relative.\n\nIn short, there's been several scenes leading up to this.  That's why it's okay for people to have heard that Arya Stark is running around.  That creates a massive plot hole in the story UNLESS someone finds Arya due to it--and that someone is Brienne.\n\nNow, that's just reasons why we can expect it and it's not out of place within the show universe.  This, by the way is a key point, the Show and Book are two different universes, not the same. You seem frustrated about the scene because it is \"creating a story when there was none\".    Well, I have 3 things to say about that:\n\n1)They do this a lot.  Who didn't love Arya as Tywin's cup bearer?  Where was that in the books?  Or how about Sansa being boss with Littlefinger's trial rather than just pointing a finger at a tongueless guy?  This subreddit loves the legend Karl fooking Tanner.  The show is more than willing to create their own scenes or adaptations if the source material is too difficult to work with given TV restrictions\n\n2)TV restrictions.  Which makes better television, Brienne who we all like, fighting to fulfill her oath and save Arya against the fan-favorite Hound who has a grudging respect for Arya OR the Hound collapsing from a wound and Arya leaves him.  Both of these scenes resolve the major plot point (separate Arya from the Hound), but one has action and features multiple characters we know and like, and the other, while touching, probably won't come across well on screen.\n\n3)I think you provide the exact answer to your own question.  \"creating a story *when there was none*\". 75-80% of the fan base was disappointed with AFFC.  There wasn't enough action, it was all people traveling, that's about it.  Guess where we are in the story line?

{"body": "u wot m8 manz gon fuk yu up big tym blad u get me fam\n\nJust kidding. Treat it as you would a family holiday; be respectful, but don't be so anxious that you won't enjoy your time there. In general, I'm gonna say that literally everything in your third paragraph is superficial stuff that you shouldn't worry about in the slightest. Instead, focus on the stuff that you actually would enjoy doing. Like you said, go check out some hip hop gigs, go catch up on some cool heritage stuff, and get to know your family. \n\nIf you're staying for two months, it might be hard to make lasting friendships, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to meet new people. I'm pretty bad in that aspect, but I'd recommend going to events like gigs or sports games. Maybe even do some volunteering. If you're especially bored, I'm sure there'll be a Reddit meet-up to rinse about with at some point. Definitely avoid PC cafes, and personally I'd keep off heavy drinking, maybe just keep to a friendly few with friends or family. \n\nAlso, remember that doing things alone is absolutely fine too. Whenever I'm in Korea on holiday, I try to get some alone time to go on long bike rides or a train trip; it's nice to see new scenery and have the personal space to soak it all in. Otherwise, if you feel a little uncomfortable being out in unfamiliar settings by yourself, ask a relative that you trust and get on well with to show you around a little perhaps.\n\nAnyway, I really hope you have a good time back in the old country mate. You'll see things you love about Korea, and other things not so much; try to keep an open mind, but remember that you are on holiday and that you should mostly be doing things that you enjoy.\n\nHave a good one!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402430692", "subreddit": "korea", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

House Stark is based on the house of York, lets give them northern english accents; Dorne clearly has distinct Iberian influences, lets give them Spanish accents. I love all that and think it makes the show so much more rich than if someone had taken less care with such minutiae. It's just so frustrating that they've deviated away from this where it is actually in some cases easier not to. \n\nTake Burn Gorman, the guy who played Karl Fookin Tanner. The guy is an incredibly skilled character actor who is adept at many different accents. The actor himself is from southern England. Yet, even though they've established a northern accent that comes from north of the neck and also established that the character comes from Kings Landing in the south (thousands of miles away), the producers have told Gorman to put on a northern (in this case a spectacularly good Manchester) accent for some bizarre reason I just can't fathom. Coming from 'gin alley' in King's Landing, the guy should sound like an east end Londoner if they want consistency. If a show is going to establish rules in its first season it should respect the fans who do care by following those rules throughout.

{"body": "See, here's the thing. I've been following RimWorld for quite a while. The very first playable build released was a solid, fun game, good for 20ish hours of play. Less than a year later it's a hugely improved game. It would easily receive a warm reception if he released it how it currently is, even though it's nowhere near complete. \nPart of it's success is that the lead dev is a chill dude. I've asked a couple of questions on the forums etc and got decent answers. He is 100% transparent in how he develops. The RimWorld YouTube page actually has a [series where he takes you through the programming behind some of the games mechanics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBQn_sg7DA) \nIf you go on the site and read the list of things to be added, it's a tight, succinct little design doc that describes everything that needs to be done with a realistic scope. So far, there has been no feature creep at all.\n\nOn the other hand, TUP has a ridiculous scope, and suffers from an insane amount of feature creep. I've been reading these forums for over a year, and I don't think I've ever seen the lead developer say \"no\" to a \"will x be in the game\" question. I've even asked questions about the mechanics of inventing items and got a bunch of non answers back. The \"invention engine\" in the video is nothing at all like what was being discussed here back when I first came in contact with the game. I'd say there are maybe two developers in the entire world that are capable of making a game as ambitious as this. And they both have years and years of experience in both game design, and programming. CCP probably has thousands of years experience between the bulk of their main game employees, and all have worked on other games in the past. The [developer of this game has made one online table-top gaming system and done enterprise programming](http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/nikolas-gauvreau/13/7a8/340). That's not to say he isn't a great programmer, but I wouldn't hand over money to someone who has no track record, never mind a quarter of a million.\n\nThere is nowhere near enough transparency in the project either. Asides from a few videos and some dev logs there isn't really any proof that this amazing engine that TUP needs to work is even in existence. The examples of gameplay I've seen on YouTube could have been knocked up using any engine or game development framework in existence. Unless the game has taken large steps since [March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpRouFpFMNE0), it isn't particularly impressive anyway, unless there is some amazing stuff happening in the background. \n\nThis forum has been having the \"is this feasible\" conversation for months. Every time someone brings up the fact that this game is fucking absurd, they get shot down because VoidSpace exists. **VoidSpace isn't anywhere near the level of complexity that TUP will need to be.** It's like using Atari's Asteroids as a proof of concept for EVE: Online. VoidSpace isn't even a deep example of the genre it fills. There are space based, open world/4x games that have been in development for less time and have more.\n\ntl;dr - 250k...

That being said, there is something, even done in moderation (which unfortunately is hard for me to do because I tend to binge until my libido is gone :( ) there is something it does to maybe your dopamine receptors or whatever. It fucks with with the natural reward system. At least for me, I find that after some PMO I just don't feel compelled to look people in the eye, I don't get that subtle jolt of dopamine(?) reward.

Everyone always loses their shit when they don't recreate a characters story page for page. They changes they have made haven't bothered me at all. Maybe I just have a different mindset then others, but after reading all 5 books and seeing (more or less) the exact same story unfold on tv is immensely gratifying to me. I soak it all in for what it is and enjoy it. I think others have serious problems doing the same. The casual show watcher doesn't get the inner monologues we get while reading and to be completely honest unless you read the story the casual watcher has a very hard time just keeping track of the huge amount of characters. Stuff needs to be cut just to keep the casual watcher involved because let's face it, the amount of people that watch and haven't read the books probably dwarfs the number that have by a considerable margin. The producers have read the books and I'm sure they want to reproduce it as faithfully as possible, but they have to make it moderately accessible for the casual watcher and I think they do a great job. \n\n...

{"body": "Suppose he *is* the real villain in the end. ... All the more reason to make people root for him. That's what makes compelling television. See Tony Soprano, Walter White, hell, even Dexter for about four seasons. If he's the villain and you play him as the villain all the way through, then who gives a fuck? Half the charm of ASOIAF is that it's ruthlessly unpredictable with the way it treats tropes and conventions. Whether Stannis is ultimately AA or the Night's King (or anywhere in between), he needs to be complex; the question about what will happen to him should be ambiguous. People who love him and hate him on both sides should be equally at risk of deep disappointment in the end.\n\nIn the book Stannis is unreasonably just and kind of an asshole, but he also has redeeming qualities, and so it's still an open question up until the beginning of TWOW whether he's ultimately going to be redeemed by his good qualities (or because he's about to royally fuck up some Freys and Boltons) or consumed by the bad (**cough** uncompromising prick **cough**).\n\nIn the show, though, we've got a lot of ground to cover to make Stannis likeable because his trajectory has emphasized the more unpleasant decisions. He's had a few good moments (demanding to see his daughter comes to mind), but not much that actually speaks to his status as the king who cares, and now's the moment of truth. I think it's still early enough that the jury could still be out on whether D&amp;D are being influenced by their bias, but he's got a lot of lost development opportunities to make up for. Stephen Dillane is a fookin' rock star as far as I'm concerned, and I would cheerfully write off some of the more unsavory moments in the show as Stannis's humanity if they tried to pull back the other direction next season.\n\nStannis has to become more complicated. He needs his religious utilitarian ambivalence back, his respect for winter. I want to see what's going on in Stannis's head (or at least what Davos thinks is going on in his head). In the book the Wall is really where the character comes into his own despite Davos being his chief apologist since the beginning, since it's only then that Stannis is actually *being* king. I think how that's adapted will be very telling about whether D&amp;D really give a damn about a faithful adaptation of the character or they want to just paint him with the bad guy brush.\n\nOf course, it's also possible that they no longer have a good grasp on their material and its fans. Judging from tonight's episode (which was good, don't get me wrong), they seem to be floundering. This episode needed two hours, and there was absolutely two hours to be had in some of the non-canon material earlier in the season, but it wasn't paced properly.\n\nIs it still the best thing on TV? Maybe, but it could be a lot better, and if we can't have LSH then fixing Stannis is a pretty damn good place to start.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402897946", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

We got a table, and this old guy wandered up to us, slammed his fist down and shouted \"THE FOOKIN BRITS.\"\n\nWhile the rest of my group was stunned into silence, I started talked (Which happened more than once, it's weird, I was always the unsocial one but when we were confronted with a pair of greasy Turks I was the first to step in and saved our lives) about how horrible the British were, pulling out Robin Williams and Eddie Izzard lines like \"So uptight they forced the Puritans out\" and \"No flag, no country!\"\n\nA more comparable story would be from Dresden, when our teacher had to take a phone call from his son in a hospital in the States, and our bus driver took over. This guy was amazing, had fantastic French techno that he blared on the bus rides, and didn't take shit from **anyone**.\n\nWe ended up wandering to a street party, a large alleyway that the locals set up shops for tinkets and Doner, or in one place set up a sprinkler with a plate of watermelon under it, with a sign proclaiming 'Free to the Brave'.

I imagine he'll do a lot of sitting around and warging, and surfing weirwood.net. This is about all I could come up with for now. Feel free to offer suggestions or alterations and I'll see if I can improve on this!\n\nEDIT: I'm adding a few things based on suggestions. I can't really include much Sansa or Littlefinger since we've seen most of their arc already and don't really know what's coming, but I suppose I can make some educated guesses. I left out a lot of the Dornish plotline because I just can't really remember much of it if I'm honest. I'm sure the Sand Snakes will be introduced in ep1.\n\nI should clarify that I definitely prefer a version where Jaime doesn't get sent to Dorne, but I'm not sure how they're going to circumvent the fact that they haven't introduced Arys or Ser Balon yet, and given that we know Doran and Areo are set to be cast already, it's probably likely that they'll want to reduce the number of new characters we see in Dorne to a smaller number. It'd be a bit of a bombardment at first.\n\nIt's also really hard to be specific about the middle episodes because it really depends on what kind of pacing they go with. There's a strong chance they mess around with Tyrion's arc quite a bit because I feel like Pentos, Volantis, Yunkai and Meereen are all going to look very similar on-screen, so people are not really going to understand that he's moving from place to place. Not to mention the budget considerations of doing so much shooting in more open spaces to show the cities themselves, compared to some scenes of Tyrion and Jorah's relationship or their slave experiences which can be shot on a smaller scale. We know Yezzan has been cast, so that's something to be confident of.\n\nWhen it comes to what's going on with Bran, I feel like the show is unlikely to be able to do too much with him right now. I don't know if they're going to want to shell out for Bloodraven prosthetics every episode, and so I wouldn't be surprised if we get a fairly small amount of material stretched over the entire season. We may get the Ned flashback though, which would be awesome.\n\n**NOTE:** I'm approaching this analysis from the perspective that we should assume a *lot* of stuff is going to be cut. There are a lot of aspects to the KL storyline and Brienne/Podrick's journey, as well as the Dornish plotline and Dany's tribulations in Meereen, that would result in the introduction of way, way too many new characters. Considering that there are certain new characters that the show simply *must* introduce from a plot perspective (Victarion, Euron, Doran, Quentyn, the Sand Snakes, Manderly, Aegon and JonCon, ), coupled with more time spent on existing characters (Mance, Davos, Blackfish/Edmure, Sam, Qyburn, Asha/Yara), means that the show is going to really be spreading itself too thin if it doesn't cut a lot of stuff out. It could certainly throw out my entire template and spread the two books over two seasons - this is something I'd love to see, since it would mean more seasons of the show - but I think that's unlikely, since there would be a lot of fudging of timelines that would result in a bunch of new filler material being created, similar to Jon's little trip to Craster's Keep this season. Although that did give us a fooking legendary original character to enjoy.\n\nUltimately, if they decide to go for two seasons instead of one, the entire thing will be different. It's also worth noting that it will be entirely different if one of these crazy theories about Daario being Euron or something else crazy happening ends up being true - this would cause a complete reimagining of certain angles to the story. It's also vaguely plausible that they keep certain aspects as a complete surprise. As an arbitrary example (one which I personally would rather they didn't do), they could really scale down the Greyjoy plotline early on and perhaps not even introduce Victarion, and instead wait until the Battle of Meereen is in full swing, before a fleet of Ironborn suddenly lands on the beaches out of nowhere and wins the battle for Dany's forces out of nowhere. Victarion is then subsequently introduced as the leader of the fleet who saved Dany, and his character and motivations are unravelled in retrospect. I'd prefer to see more of him earlier in the season, but if they feel they need to save time, this is a possibility, as are various other alterations. They could easily use the Aegon reveal as a 'shock moment', for example, rather than introducing him as Young Griff beforehand.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402968476", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 92, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "With a low deep throated groan I stood up, straightening out my sore back and stretched my battered and beaten muscles, grimacing as i felt the bruises that covered my body.  Disgusted, I spat into the darkness as I recalled the events that lead me here.\n\nI remembered everything, from the rat faced little halfling, his face devoid of the characteristic cherubic features that grace his kind, to the other thugs and cut-throats he'd hired, all bark and no bite, boasting how *they* would spill the most blood and that *they* would claim the bulk of the spoils, regardless of whether the blood spilled would have to be friend or foe.\n\n*But then again*, I thought to myself bitterly, *I suppose I really shouldn't look down on the ugly bastards so, seeing as how I'm hardly any better when it comes to wealth*. Truth be told, I probably would have enjoyed sinking my blade into the backs of those sorry whore sons, with or with out the promise of easy imperial gold.  I thought wistfully of the plans I had made, I would've been able to spend *months* at Madame Silk's, never having to so much as fetch my own ale or even bring the dammed mug to my own mouth with all the girls I would've rented.  Hell I probably would've bought them too, all they'd have to do to convince me was flash a pretty smile on their pretty little faces. \n\n*Fucks sake man, do you really have to get a hard on for every single pair of tits you see? No*, I thought, remembering the raid that had most likely taken place a few days ago, *just the pretty ones.*  It should have been easy, the archers and the wizard distracting the vanguard and the bulk of the caravan while the muscle did a quick hit and run on the wagons.  When the first shots had been fired I took the lead, drawing my bastard sword and my dirk as I ran, weaving through the surprised guards with ease.  Within moments I was inside one of the carriages, planning to snag a bauble or two from the no doubt whimpering Duke.   What I had not expected was the Duke's daughter, quivering in the corner, wearing the most *scandalous* outfit I'd ever seen that wasn't worn by a call girl. I must admit, I had stood staring for quite a while, transfixed as I was by the way her bust threatened to spill out of her dark red ball gown. It was only when one of the thugs, a huge brute of a man, clambered into the carriage did I wake from my enchantment. *Hey*, he shouted over his shoulder, *this bloke 'ere found the Duke's li'le girly*. *\"ey now*, he said to me, never taking his eyes off the girl as he licked the lips of his ugly, scarred mouth, *I got dibs soon as 'ouve had a go, right?* *Fuck off, she's mine*, I said, the steel behind my words palpable. *You wot mate? Think You can take me o-* the words stopped dead in his mouth as I reversed my grip on my dirk and slammed it up and through the bottom of his mouth. With a grunt I kicked him out the carriage door, pulling my blade free as he fell. Looking outside I realized I had spent far too long admiring the young lady, as the guards had started to organize themselves as the other raiders made off with what spoils they had collected. I started to turn, a devilishly clever and suave line at the tip of my tongue when the beautiful young lady who's honor I had just defended, quite courageously if I might add, knocked me unconscious with a lantern. \n\nSighing, I glanced about my surroundings before finally noticing my cellmate, hidden in the shadows of the dark cell. \"And who might you be?\" I asked offhandedly as I looked through the bars of my cell, hoping to find a way to escape.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402983881", "subreddit": "YouEnterADungeon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thanks to /u/EMoneySC2 for the dram!\n\nI'm sometimes asked why I want some of the Ryes aged in the US that source their juice from Canada.\n\nI mean, I could just buy the Canadian whisky, right? Well... there are some differences.\n\nFirst off, yes, the rye and the water comes from Alberta. And I don't blame them. Have you been to Alberta? Just being in the mountains makes you feel healthier and more natural. The food is well made, good quality. And the beef? Holy shit, best beef I've ever had. And I could have the same juice. But we don't have the weather.\n\nAlberta's weather is mental. And cold. Which means that you have to leave the whisky in the cask longer.\n\nThere's Canadian Oak too. Yes, it's the same species as American Oak (Quercus alba). Yet people think it changes the flavour. Some of these people are Canadian wine and whisky makers. I wonder if it does too much, or the trees growing in a different climate being as good for whisky. Can't really say either way, however it adds a dimension again.\n\nAnd the pricing laws on alcohol in Canada means that a higher Abv. ups the price. Automatically. So even with higher ends Canadian whisky, you still see 40% all over the place. Even on 3 20+ year whiskies I've seen in the past 3 months.\n\nSo yes, I wanted to try **Whistle Pig Boss Hog 2013**, because, well, I wanted to see what the juice would taste like after a good long while, at a proper Abv., and all from a single barrel and not vatted. Not to mention finished in ex-bourbon barrels (again, something that probably happens up here, I just usually don't hear too much about it because I'm not searching enough).\n\nAnd that's why I'm reviewing something from Vermont.\n\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario\n\n**Region:** Vermont\n\n**Abv:** 67%\n\n**Colour:** Burgundy\n\n**Nose:** Rye spices, pepper, pine, caramel, orange, sea salt, yeast, cayenne pepper, dill\n\nInstantly I can tell that this was made in Alberta. And yet, it's stronger and more complex than almost anything that has come from them. This is a beast. After water, you end up with a little dill, which I'm going to hazard comes from the finish in something that had LDI in it.\n\n**Taste:** Corn, hot sauce, lime, dill, cumin, coconut, cream, dry\n\nThere's a sweetness that has come out of aging this that normally doesn't. Don't know if it's the extra two years versus the [Alberta Springs](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1rhtkq/alberta_springs_review/), or if it is due to the Abv, however this has different elements.\n\nThat said, I had to add water to it. And not a few drops, this needed to calm the fuck down. This is fookin crazy man. I like a good burning whisky, but wow.\n\nAfter awhile, ti becomes very dry. I wish I could appreciate a nice dry whisky more, however that'll dock points for me.\n\n**Finish:** Caramel, salt, dill, burnt butter, pine, alcohol, almond, cardamon, coconut, ocean air\n\nLittle bit too dry at the end. Spicy, hot as fuck (still, need more water), but dry. More of the Canadian/Alberta rye with some pine. \n\n**Conclusion:** This is a good overall dram. Yeah, there's some issues with strength, but honestly, I'd prefer that to low Abv. Water is needed, and it's a tad dry. The dill seems out of place throughout. They've brought out spices and a creamy flavour on the rye, so that's awesome. I'd say, if you can find it, have a dram. You'll enjoy it.\n\n**82/100**\n\n*Bourbon review #19, Vermont #1*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403010787", "subreddit": "bourbon", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;its not \"reddit\" anti gamestop its GAMER anti gamestop. you can be assured any where a gamestop post is posted the gamers anti game stop brigades arise and take up arms. ..... reddit is just people from around the globe. so that means if reddit as a whole is anti game stop, then that represents a good chunk of public opinion internet wide.\n\n\"reddit\" is also anti-EA. I don't mean specifically someone on /r/cutecats is anti-EA, clearly I'm implying the subreddits that tend to voice their opinions on that specific matter. If you can't derive that from the post... you must love browsing reddit and feeling like people are crazy for their odd perceptions of trends. \n\nI'm going to try to decipher the rest of your post. Please correct me if I misinterpret what you were implying. \n\n&gt;heres gamestop in a nut shell.... a place that sells only video games and rvideo game related items 99% console related. thats it.\n\nWhen I worked there starting back in '06 they carried used DVDs as well, a large selection of them. Last I saw they also carry iPads and such now too. This move surprised me. They also carry TONS of PC games via digital download, and carry steamwallet (I trade in console games for steamwallet nowadays). But generally, you're correct, they are a shop targeting the console gaming market. \n\n&gt;its not a great place to get a great deal. \n\nThere are times where the deals are good. Especially with the next-gen (since Bluray), games don't get scratched up anymore. You have to TRY to scratch up a Bluray. This drastically increased my appeal toward used games for consoles. I trade in games and buy used often, warranting the edge card (actually is now called Power Up card now that I think of it). Every 3 months or so (sometimes sooner) gamestop has a Buy 2 used, get 1 free deal. That's amazing. Assuming that was going on next week (when I return to NYC after being away for over a year), I would be able to get say, Watch_Dogs (PS4 $49.50), Soul Sacrifice Delta (PSV  $17.99), and the Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster (PSV $31.49). Total that would cost me $81+tax. If I bought those new instead, that would cost me $130+tax. If saving $50 is nothing to you, I don't know what to say. \n\n&gt;you cant even get a pre order half the tiem after dropping a dp on it, they took waaay more down payments then they KNEW they were getting copies for\n\n$5 to pre-order a game is fully refundable or transferable. I don't know which gamestop you went to (or if you actually pre-ordered it) but ALL pre-ordered copies of games are guaranteed and held aside for 48 hours. The only exception MIGHT be if you pre-order a game 24 hours before it releases, in which case the initial shipment may have already departed. \n\n&gt; so if you want to get treated like you are interupting a rousing round of so i beat this level in xx amount of minutes convo, and then prompted several times to purchase extras...and then if you dare ask a question not related to the transaction like \"could you tell me when xxxx game comes up for pre order?\" and they look at each other like you just asked for the second code to launch a missile at some distant city in some distant country....then while one dives for a terminal and the other asks some kid if they need help finding anything.........and three people end up waiting behind you i say\"never mind ill look online\" and he says \" i just did you wotn find anything\"...yeah.......sigh gamestop wheeeeee.\n\nThat was a tough one to read. From what I gather you wanted to find out when the release date for a certain game was, and they ignored you? That is definitely a poor employee. It takes literally 2 or 3 keystrokes to see the pre-order screen and one extra keystroke to PRINT OUT every release date for a console that gamestop has on file. Some have pseudo dates though, if the game doesn't have an official date yet. Heck, Perhaps you were being difficult with the employee and are you are only telling your own side where you think you were in the clear. Maybe they tried telling you there was no release date for the game yet, hence the \"You won't find anything\" reply. \n\nIf the way you type is in any way related to how you act in public as a customer. You may be the problem yourself. Otherwise, you might just have poor gamestop employees, it's possible. Overall, the company isn't out to be evil though. They do pretty cool things like launch parties/midnight launches. Before digital distro was huge, lining up at gamestop to buy something like WoW:BC was a pretty neat experience with friends. Then you all went home and installed/played something new together at like 12:15am. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403183338", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I guess they want to address a low number of hispanic dentists, but the thing is that all the hispanic kids I went to school with came from upper middle class families, and none of them moved back to the Valley when they were done.

{"body": "An ordinary potato is just a starchy root vegetable. An extraordinary potato, well, let me tell you a story:\n\nA long time ago, some time before the Irish Famine, there was said to be a potato so great that its mere existance was inspiration to all of the other potatoes. Small potatoes and big potatoes, white potatoes and red potatoes and purple and yellow and sweet potatoes all around the world aspired to its legacy. They only wished that one day they might be held as favourable comparisons. All was well in the land of the potato.\n\nOne day, on his way home, a particularly greedy, particularly drunk irishman happened upon the field where the great potato grew. Standing in the middle of the field at least four times as tall as the rest, its stalk fascinated the incoherent and inexcusable brute. He walked over and tried to remove it from the ground.\n\n\"Stop!\" The mighty potato beckoned, \"you know not what you do. Your actions today are of paramount importance to the fate of your people\".\n\n\"Don't fookin' tell me nuttin' ya fookin' dirty root!\" He continued to dig and tug, much to the chagrin of the potato.\n\n\"You have been warned,\" bellowed the great potato, \"you and yours will face great consequence for this indiscretion\".\n\n\"You shut yer dirty fookin'... mouth ya great stupid git! I'll fookin' mash ya\".\n\nThe man continued to toil away and the potato continued to threaten him, being unable to do much else given his vegetative state.\n\nWhen the drunken intruder finally exposed the potato, he was struck with awe and wonder. Gazing upon its starchy husk, he dropped to his knees and faded, watching as the potato rose from the ground of its own accord through darkening vision.\n\nSome three days later, he awoke in his bed, his dear wife Margaret at his side.\n\n\"Lord tunderin' Jesus fookin' Christ Maggie, I saw the most incredible thing! I saw a potato rise from out of the ground into the air all by itself. 'Twas a fookin' miracle, Maggie!\"\n\nOf course, she never did believe him, and so he swore he would never drink again and that he would find the potato again, this time with his sobriety in check to lend credibility to his claim.\n\nHe never found the potato, and even began to doubt its existence himself, but his words were true: he never drank again. And that, my friend, is a miraculous feat all in itself.\n\nTL; DR: potato so fantastical it can make an irishman lay off the hooch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403367357", "subreddit": "leafs", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Next off, poutine is brown gravy, cheese curds and fries. If you consider that a culinary masterpiece, then there is no question that you come from the UK.\n\nVery, very technically you're right. I'm a Hillbilly.\n\nMy forefathers were so damned unagreeable to the Welsh, they got chased into the hills of Scotland until the Welsh either got tired, or figured the Northern breeds of sheep were too ugly to rape. (Family oral tradition sides with the latter.)\n\nDespite trying their best to fit in, they were thrown out of Scotland for being too uncouth and barbaric to be proper Scots highlanders. Besides, although they were hard workers, they were also hopeless drunks - the whole clan. So... Ireland it was.\n\nThe stay in Ireland was short. As I mentioned, they had something of a drinking problem. They had no problem holding their liquor, mind you, but they did have a problem actually paying for it. They tried their best to convert to Catholicism, but as my G-G-G-G-grandfather Angus McMeth is said to proclaimed: \"Yew no a queer for stickin' altar boys, iss this wine ye give but a dram of. If'n I walk two hour an' listen to ya' spin tales about rainin' frogs, I speck ya' to have sumpin' wi' more hair on it's arse.\"\n\nSo they set sail to the New World. America. Land of dreams, land of opportunity, land of - Fight in a fookin' war? We jus' got 'ere. Fight yer' own fookin' war ya dingus. I ge' inna' war, I ain' gon' be civil - thas' no the point of a war.\n\nBy their reckoning, they'd already paid their indentured servitude due to a loophole (basically that there was a an entire ocean between them and their creditors - best o' luck in your search). As being driven into the hills was sort of their trade by this point, my G-grandfather hooked up with the town belle and proceeded West with All Possible Haste. Not many people know this, but All Possible Haste was a famous racehorse that went missing right about the time my clan was asked to settle their rather large bar tab.\n\nThere you have it. McMeth Scots-Irish history as accurately as I can relate it. \n\nIn retrospect, I suppose I want Poutine due to the 'potato troubles' Ireland had. (Which translates into the English looting anything remotely capable of being eaten, hammered into a necklace for whatever German was currently on the throne, or might be of any interest to the French and therefore needed to be destroyed on principle.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403474750", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, the weirdest true thing happened to my friend the other day and I felt that I should narrate the events to you.\n\nBasically, he was walking to school and a car carrying a ton of lesbians drove by (we live in Europe so it's not unusual to see same-sex relationships in public). They stopped next to him and said that he was *so* handsome - and they had been so impressed by his flawless Doctor Who impressions - that they had all turned straight for him on the spot, and they wanted him to get in the car and have an orgy - \"Get in and fuck us stud, the condoms are under the sink\"\n\n(you're going to love his response!)\n\n\"OK ladies, which do you prefer? The Beatles or Justin Bieber? Queen or One Direction?\"\n\nThey looked at him all confused and said\n\n\"obviously we only like Justin Bieber and One Direction.\"\n\n\"WRONG!\" my friend said. \"Justin Bieber and all modern musicians are shit sell outs with no real talent. I would be happy to educate m'ladies on *proper* music... *sigh*... However I won't today because I need to go to school, so that one day I can -fuck you- be a nuclear engineer.\"\n\nObviously these girls weren't going to take no for an answer! They began heckling him, even offering him $100 dollar bills as payment. That was the last straw.\n\n\"I have an (asan) girlfriend, you whores!\" he shouted, hoping to become feared and respected.\n\nOne of the lesbians tried to say something in retaliation, but a little old lady who never says anything and had been watching, screamed \"OH BURN\" and smashed her fookin head in with a fly swatter, hitting the car so hard the metal broke. In the silence that followed you could have heard a pin drop.\n\n\"Frist of all,\" shouted the ugliest woman, \"How **dare** yuo-\"\n\nAnd at that exact moment a bald eagle called Patriotic Patricia swooped in. She puffed up like the proud mama bird she was, and carried the car of lesbians off to her nest (it's a London thing, you wouldn't understand). Everyone cheered and my friend could WALK AWAY WITH HONOR.\n\nA nearby m'lady saw my friend at that point and said \"You know what? I've seen the error of my ways now. I give up dating assholes. I could really go for a nice guy like you.\"\n\n^(The little old lady saw this, and said \"I'm not current on all the lingo, but I believe you've just been *un friend zoned*, young man\")\n\nWell, fellow redditers, a gent[LE]sir never tells, but let's just say he's not a vigin anymore ;)\n\nAnd that my friend's name?\n\nAlbertham.\n\nFucking.\n\nLincolnstein.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403559508", "subreddit": "worststory", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

I found it funny, growing up, how these hard-man-frontin, school-hatin 'gangstas' (not all black, by the way) could express the most profound ideas in the same way they discussed the girls they fucked last weekend, and that so many of the other people I knew (the rich, mostly white ones) would get trashed in a debate by these people they considered below them due to the way they talk.\n\nIt's the breaking of cultural expectations that is the source of the humour, for me. Not \"black people talking heady ideas\". That's routine for me.\n\nAnyway, I just always post in character as Stringer Bell from The Wire.

{"body": "Who is he again?\n\nEDIT: Oh alright we're gonna play the downvote game now? Too bad I can't remember what my comment karma was before. #REKT\n\nEDIT: Seriously? Fine, keep downvoting me. navyseal.txt. Swear on me mum.\n\nEDIT: Sweet. More downvotes. You know, this sub-reddit is really going downhill fast. People used to care about something. It was called \"Explain to me like I am a five-year old.\" And you know what? That's what they did. They would explain things to people as if they were actually five. Then this new Mod comes in and starts claiming we need to explain things for adult 5-year olds. Well, fine. But the downvotes? You people do realize karma doesn't grow on trees right? I work hard for this stuff. I wake up early **every day** and try to come up with witty things to post. When that doesn't work, I go to /r/circlejerk, which is a bronze mine (I say bronze, since silver is already a well-known reddit joke and gold is gold, which a kind stranger did give me once, take that haters). Anyway, good. Keep downvoting me. See if I care about your imaginary internet points.\n\nEDIT: Okay, I think this has gone on long enough, don't you? I mean, think about what it means to hit that blue down arrow. You are sharing in collectively dropping the guillotine. Nice job Robespierre. How do you sleep at night?\n\nEDIT: It's just so simple, isn't it? You just hit the little button and then go about your business. Hmm, maybe you'll browse Imgur for a bit. A little User Sub for you, Old Boy? Go on. Indulge! You deserve it with all that JUDGEMENT you've been **raining down** on a poor ELI5r, just trying to make a simple joke. \n\nEDIT: Take a good hard look in the mirror. You oughtta be ashamed.\n\nEDIT: You know, I don't even have to come on here and make semi-off-color jokes about tragic diseases. I don't do it for the karma. I do it to contribute to the THEORY and CULTURE of Reddit. That's what it's really been about all along. With every little blue click, you're killing that. You're part of the problem. What kind of sadistic pestilence has invaded this once peaceful sub-reddit? Is the 4chan leak that bad? Is 9gag that bored? Is funnyjunk that slow to load? Are the feminists of tumblr that angry? Are the ads on youtube that long? Are the posts on facebook that dull? Prithee! What? How has such brimstone falleth down upon this poor slob, just trying to make it in this cruel sub? Are there no heroes left? No true bravery? A tragic age we have entered. Woe. Truly, woe.\n\nEDIT: brb, bathroom\n\nEDIT: Back. Wow. I see you're all still horrible people. \n\nEDIT: \"Because I could not stop for downvotes, they kindly stopped for me.\" That's poetry, which I'm guessing you **uncultured Saracens** didn't get, but if I might use my unfortunate position to evangelize a bit, I'm using it as a sort of existential comfort. This is what you've all driven me to. I didn't even like Dickinson. I was once a Frost man. A little Yeats at times. Well, you've driven me to Dickinson. That's what you have done.\n\nEDIT: It's *bourgeois* is what it is. The karma, I mean. I mean, there are some people that have clearly been given advantages over others when it comes to gaining karma. Think about it. Better ISPs, more free time, etc. They didn't build that. Why should they reap all the benefits?\n\nEDIT: Grammar\n\nEDIT: AMA Request, Redditors with consciences. First question, how do you stay such a good person when everyone else on here clearly isn't?\n\nEDIT: Someone literally just called me \"cancer\". It was questionable before, but now I'm positive I'm not gonna recover from this fiasco. Where are the good Samaritans standing up for under dogs? Isn't that practically in the Reddit Constitution? A treasonous lot you are, all of you. If our Founding Admins could see you now they'd be shocked at what their site has become!\n\nFINAL EDIT: You know what I'm just so done with this. Faith in humanity = lost.\n\nEDIT: ELI5: But why so much hate?\n\nEDIT: As if I care about 45 negative imaginary internet points. Seriously. I'll have you know I'm a **GOD** on Facebook. My posts regularly receive septuple digit likes without even trying. Mark Zuckerberg himself once had me over for dinner asking for advice on how to improve his own social media presence. So don't sit there all smug thinking your down vote matters. It doesn't. You might as well be paying for a Porsche with Monopoly money, Little Man, because in my world, you couldn't even get your mom to like your status. \n\nEDIT: This is literally how Caesar felt when Brutus dealt his terrible blow. I feel so hurt and betrayed I just walked down to Walgreens and picked up their last 8 cartons of Hagan Daas. RIP my pancreas. Guess whose soul that's on. Hint: yours.\n\nEDIT: Woke up this morning to see if this reign of terror was over. My expectations for Reddit were far too high.\n\nEDIT: Hey /u/Danny702, you may remember me as the guy that innocently went along with your joke and commented below you, thereby contributing to the richness of Reddit's history and presence as a social movement. It seems that you too weren't immune to the firestorm of hate that has befallen this thread. I just want to know that I'm here for you. A brother in solidarity against the tide of malice we're facing. Stand tall, Danny Boy. And when you get knocked down, you get up again, they're never gonna keep us down!\n\nEDIT: Home from the doctors. Diabetes confirmed.

The whole point of saying is a thing is that you're standing up to say to thing, you get to choose how to say the thing. People wear clothes to suit how they want to look so why can't people choose words that suit how they want to sound? You tell me that you go around telling people how they should look and sound? Sounds like that thing where people are really specific about stuff pedanty or summink.  \n\nOr maybe, just maybe some people approach the written form as a piece of prose, an aesthetic that they wish to establish and maintain. A syllable count they wish to match, perhaps they read \"too much\" Shakespeare when they were younger and have an \"unhealthy\" fondness for rhyming verse, maybe they just like the English language and wish to stretch out to consume and use as much of it as they can because they like how words sound.\n\n&gt; You use too many words. Don't waste people's time with overly flowery language to try to pretend like you're oh so sophisticated.\n\nFuck you. Don't project your malice or your own insecurities over language on to me. If you take an issue with my aesthetic then I don't fucking see how that's my problem, I only see it as yours.  \nI never fucking down vote on here but you're really quite \"exceptional\" as a human being (\"exceptional\" I would hope might demonstrates how \"clean language\" can be vulgar. It's merely a case of crafting it, if it doesn't sound offensive that's just because you can't hear the colossal vitriol I'm exuding it with).\n\n&gt; He should be a good friend, and call his friend whatever his friend is comfortable with as far as he has to address his friend's condition. End of story. Fuck off with your grammar bullshit.\n\nAt what point did I take exception with that?

God damn they're good. Some of the most convincingly tragic music I've ever heard. Powerful as all hell.\n\n[Adagio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTkb1CRAuJo) - Aggressive symphonic/power metal.\n\n[Angel Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKh4n36k5XA) - Power metal. Got a fairly classic, though aggressive sound.\n\n[Angra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99izXhZSZws) - Power/prog/symphonic. You've probably heard em before.\n\n[Anubis Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8GsX_zgs0) - Prog.\n\n[Archons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUy-ko2blVI) - Melodeath.\n\n[Ares Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqt7lYpYz18) - Melodeath/heavy metal/thrash.\n\n[Arsis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdWvwCRZs3I) - Technical Melodeath which you've probably already heard.\n\n[Ash Borer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vN_G9NFwJU) - Black/folky/atmospheric stuff, sort of similar to Agalloch, though a bit more raw imo.\n\n[Atlanatean Kodex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw2X2As76hs) - Power/heavy.\n\n[Axamenta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nncggC7-jdU&amp;list=PL91D9F8A9BD2751FC) - Melodeath with a dash of progginess and a strong symphonic element. Good stuff. Definitely got more bite than your standard band in the genre. God, I used to be obsessed with this album.\n\n[Ayreon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=codSKV_0NrQ) - Power/prog.\n\n[Bal Sagoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9K3D4b7KOA&amp;list=PL7E9EAD62AD783C50) - Black/symphonic/prog.

{"body": "&gt;you fail to understand the deeper underlying themes of some of the better novels as a cursory reading would yield\n\nReally? An accusation of cursory reading? \n\nWe're talking about pulp fiction. It spreads the page wide for a reader. That's the damn purpose of it. It's supposed to read easy, it's supposed to be ham handed. It's worse at hiding its intentions than a dan brown novel. \n\nThis is the universe that didn't even bother to mask \"Jihad\" in **2008**. \n\nHold on, let me find something a little *less* subtle. \n\nOh right. Space america helps defend ~~the free world against~~ the inner sphere, and by doing so gets involved with a band of religiously motivated cast-offs who later come back to haunt it.\n\nI don't know what nonsense you think you're going to spout here, but 'cursory reading'? Good god, man, you're either trying to puff yourself up or you don't have a clue about what you're trying to say. \n\n&gt;themes and storylines evolved from that paradigm\n\nU wot? U wot m8?\n\nThey didn't evolve from a 'paradigm' as if it were some sort of manifest ideal. There was no great example set for these novels. These were simplistic totems, something the universe in general has never given up. The novels *still* tarry along the edges of the modern. They're throwing these things up because they're popular culture, thoughts of the times, but in such a fashion that they are form and not function. There's no great and deeper meaning behind the plot arcs, just snapshots of the neuvaux. They're glimpses, touches, nothing more. \n\nSeriously. Those early novels weren't *influenced* by the waning years of the Cold War, they **were** the Cold War. For the love of god, you're talking about a comeuppance against a sino-russian amalgamation, shortly replaced with what just *happened* to be an analogue of the 'fears' of Japanese technocracy. \n\nAgain, I absolutely love this universe, but the idea that we're dealing with some sort of unique snowflake with deep discussions is laughable.
