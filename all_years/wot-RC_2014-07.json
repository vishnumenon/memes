{"body": "U wot m8? I have played like one or two games where my enemy was a comp, to get the basics of  OKW. All the rest were against real players.I have a team made of 3/4 players, sitting on teamspeak. I can send you a replay where my strat proved just wonderful against two players, one playing as americans with their \"mighty\" bars and one as russians. In the same match.                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                      \n\nLeading with King Tiger have a major flaw in your logic. What if enemy player have 2 wolverines/jackons on top of bazooka units? It will be destroyed in a matter of seconds. Infantry units are usually easier to replace than tanks. Especially when we talk about big, expensive tanks. Kubelwagen is a good asset even in lategame, he is not supposed to kill, but to SUPRESS enemy infantry, if he is well placed he can do it just good and we have ubersoldaten executing everyone. I am using mainly scavenging doctrine while playing as OKW. Jaeger squad, infiltration tactics, ostwind - these things can make miracles when well used against enemy infantry.                                                                                                 \n\nYou have your own strat, i have my own working so far just fine, so don't try to be elitist. I like this game because you can just have your own strat, not being forced to use the ultimate and only the rightful one. What's wrong about that?\n\n\nEDIT: It's one week after new expansion, and you are big talking about your strat, which just turned \"great\" in video you have provided. Just chill man. As i said, everyone have right to have their own strat.

{"body": "* Bullet-spongy enemies: get the Artifact of Glass, problem solved.\n* Hotkeys/cooldowns: you do have to think about them, if you use the wrong one at the wrong time you leave yourself open to attack. Cooldowns are required because otherwise you'd spam the most powerful attack endlessly.\n* Infinitely spawning enemies, Artificial difficulty scaling, not keeping your money: These are all central design choices, it's like complaining about pokemon battles in a pokemon game. Just curious, how else would you have the game be, whith regard to these mechanics?\n* Initial upgrades: u wot m8? Soldier's Syringe, Crowbar, Lens Maker's Glasses, Rusty Blade, and Sticky Bomb are all offensive white tier items, and most of these are very good. Or did you mean the items that are already unlocked at the start?\n* Achievements: You are absolutely right, some of them are completely stupid. That's why you use Artifacts to cheese them like I did, just to get the items. There's only 3-4 \"hard\" ones anyway, most of them you get on accident just by playing.\n* Final Boss: It's suposed to be a long fight. Final bosses should be a test of the skills you've learned by playing the game, and each of Providence's 3 stages is different enough to be interesting and challenging. If the fight was any shorter, you'd be complaining that the ending was too easy or anti-climactic.\n* Too hard: I'm sorry, but that's not true. I can beat the game on Monsoon pretty consistently (and it's not like I'm the only one, plenty of people can). You just get better at the game by playing it more (not big surprise)\n* Class design: While I maintain that there is a clear best (Huntress), and a clear worst character (HAN-D), the classes are all pretty fun and suit different playstyles.\n* Better with friends: Funny story, I've never actually played co-op in this game. I don't find it necessary to have fun. \"The idea that \"it get's better with a friend\" should not be used at all since you can say that for almost anything\"  - that is completely correct, imho. Like I said, you can beat the game alone with some experience, so it's not \"needed\" to 100% the game.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404301445", "subreddit": "riskofrain", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Close! Nice effort to educate the masses. Have some gold. However, you've confused fixed frame-rate games and framerate independence.\n\n**Framerate-Dependent Games** *The ones TotalBiscuit rightfully complains about.*\n\nWhat happens with these is that we say \"we aim for a true cinematic 30FPS.\" If the hardware pushes out more than 30FPS we insert an artificial delay to keep it at 30FPS.\n\nYour game loop becomes this (as English as I can make it):\n\n    lastTime = get the current system time in milliseconds\n    loop over this:\n        do physics\n        do rendering\n        loop until the following condition holds true:\n            &lt;the current system time in milliseconds&gt; - lastTime &gt; (1000/30)\n        lastTime = get the current system time in milliseconds\n\nYou have now limited your game to 30 FPS. dT always has the same value: 1000/30 = 33ms.\n\n**Framerate-Independant Games**\n\n&gt; dT = The time elapsed since the last time the scene was updated (i.e. how many milliseconds it has been since physics, AI, etc. has been updated).\n\nNo artificial delay is introduced. The game is allowed to run as fast as the hardware can handle. In high-school you might have learnt this little equation:\n\n    speed = distance / time\n\nOr put into terms that is more relevant for game engines:\n\n    distance = speed x time\n\nSo a car in a racing game is travelling at 160km/h. In order to determine where that car needs to be rendered next (given where it was previously) you need to run that high school equation. This means that the &lt;distance&gt; you move the car relies on its &lt;speed&gt; and the &lt;time it has been since the last update&gt;. This paragraph is hard to understand, because it's hard to explain in words. So here's an example of how this would work in a game:\n\n1. Game starts, the car is at position 0 and travelling at 100 pixels/second.\n2. The first frame is rendered and takes 5ms (0.005 seconds).\n3. The car now needs to be moved, so, d = s*t or d = 100 * 0.005 = 0.5 pixels.\n4. Move the car 0.5 pixels, 0 + 0.5 = 0.5\n5. The second frame is rendered and takes 10ms (0.01 seconds).\n6. Running the equation again gets us d = 100 * 0.01 = 1 pixel.\n7. Move the car 1 pixel, 0.5 + 1 = 1.5\n8. The second frame is rendered and takes 20ms (0.02 seconds).\n9. Running the equation again gets us d = 100 * 0.02 = 2 pixels.\n10. Move the car 1 pixel, 1.5 + 2 = 3.5\n11. Keep doing these steps, a.k.a. looping.\n\nThis means that you need to keep track of &lt;time since the last update&gt;, a.k.a. dT. dT is extremely important to your physics engine - it may be important for other systems (input would need it to keep track of double-taps, UI would need it to do smooth animations).\n\nWhat you now have is:\n\n    lastTime = get the current system time in milliseconds\n    loop over this:\n        currentTime = get the current system time in milliseconds\n        dT = lastTime - currentTime\n        lastTime = currentTime\n        do physics knowing dT\n        do rendering knowing dT\n\nThe value of dT can now change.\n\n**Well, Why Would You Use Fixed Framerate?**\n\nBecause framerate-independence isn't as simple as high-school math. Using \"distance = speed x time\" is called Euler (pronounced \"Oiler\") integration.\n\nEuler integration is a great approximation but can be riddled with issues (scenes can \"explode\" if the framerate drops too low). For this reason, only beginner game developers really use Euler integration. Practically every experienced game developer uses more accurate and \"stable\" (stable = doesn't explode) integration methods:\n\n* **[Runge-Kutta Integration 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods):** RK4 is very likely what's being used in any framerate-independent game you have played. It demonstrates excellent stability under constant and varying framerates. The problem is that it's counter-intuitive and hence expensive to develop for (higher probability of bugs).\n* **[Verlet Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration):** Verlet Integration is likely used in any framerate-dependent game you have played. If you can find someone to explain it to you in plain English you will find that it makes loads of sense. Problem is that it's unstable if the time-step varies (but it is **very** stable if the time-step is constant).\n* **Time-Corrected Verlet Integration:** Best of both worlds, but not in mainstream use yet.\n\nIf you want a good explanation of the difficulties with integration, I strongly recommend the article on [TCV](http://lonesock.net/article/verlet.html). It has pretty graphs and stuff.\n\n**TLDR;** dT is *not* the difference in time between &lt;scene render time&gt; and &lt;target FPS&gt;, it's the total amount of time it takes to do an entire game loop pass (or more correctly stated: the difference between the last physics pass and the current physics pass - which so-happens to be the entire game loop). Otherwise, correct OP.\n\nIntegration Method | Abnormally Low Framerate | Abnormally High Framerate | Varying Framerate \n--|--|--|--\nFixed Timestep | Objects move slower than they should | Objects move faster than they should | Objects move slower and faster than they should\nEuler | U WOT M8? | U WOT M8? | U WOT M8?\nRK4 | Behaves normally | Behaves normally | Behaves normally\nTCV | Behaves normally | Behaves normally | Behaves marginally erratically\nVerlet | Behaves normally | Behaves normally | Behaves erratically\n\n*It's a lot more complex than this, but this is my best-effort layman's explanation.*", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1404395068", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "score": 119, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I disagree with the premise that D&amp;D need to \"return readers to the fold\", the majority of us didn't leave the fold and understand it's an entirely different medium. But I like where your head is at on many of these.\n\nArya: I don't know how, or why, but every change they've made to Arya's story has resulted in amazing dialogue, situations, scene pairings, etc. I'm sure Michael McElhatton and Maisie Williams would've knocked it out of the park together, but I wouldn't trade a thing if we had to give up the Dance/Williams scenes.\n\nCersei/Jaime: You're right. Putting off their split is a good thing. Remember who the Red Keep lost in Season 4: Littlefinger, Varys, Tywin, Tyrion, Lady Olenna. Season 5 will need more than Jaime training with Bronn and Cersei holding that 15 year old Tommen on her lap. So of course they'll still be able to pair Coster-Waldau and Headey.\n\nSansa/LF: I don't like saying some of the plot-settings GRRM has created are blank slates, but the LF &amp; Sansa in the Vale is kind of a blank slate, IMO, because the implications are still widely unknown to us readers. D&amp;D can do a lot of interesting things here on the way to revealing Petyr's plans and Sansa's growing aptitude for *the Game*.\n\nTyrion: His escape was straight up rushed. It's a shame. I liked the way Dinklage played the strangling, and Dance was excellent on his privy, but there was no time for anything to breathe, and that sequence needed a little breathing room. Also, D&amp;D dropping Tysha the crofter's daughter from it all, after having an exquisite Season 2 scene of him telling the story, was a shame. I get their motivation. But it's still a shame.\n\nBran/Brynden: In their defense, recall that D&amp;D removed Jahaerys II from the timeline between Maekar I and Aerys II. So a less old Three Eyed Crow is somewhat defendable. That, and they ARE actors. So it's either CGI or prosthetics. One is a ton of money, the other a ton of time. And both of those obscure the actor's face. [He's old looking, he's sitting on some creepy branches, aside from having *two fookin eyes*, I'm not sure why you were so disappointed](http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gameofthrones14_155.jpg).\n\nSam &amp; Jon: The improvements in S4 with these two were so welcomed it almost felt planned. While Harrington's sad face was merely *extra* sad in **The Watchers on the Wall**, his performances, few and far between all season long, were in fact more dynamic and interesting. And I've never had a problem with John Bradley, but I felt he was the co-MVP, along with Owen Teale, of that episode.\n\nRiverlands/Dorne: This is going to be really difficult to surmise. The rumors of Jaime's arc heading to Dorne in S5, and the likely *cutting-room-floor-ing* of LSH sounds a lot like the Riverlands dropping from the story for the foreseeable future. With such terrific actors portraying Walder Frey, Edmure, and Blackfish, this would sadden my heart.\n\nGreyjoys: Characters are getting cut/merged/altered. For television, I'd argue it's downright necessary. Too many Greyjoys for a storyline that spends most of it's time with Asha(Yara). \n\n**tldr** Prepare for changes. But it will still be great television.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404396750", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd actually argue the bitching has died down a bit. Sure there's the occasional \"where's our finished game?\" thread whenever there's a lack of updates, but generally speaking anyone who complains too much just gets downvoted into oblivion now instead of being fed. Although like you said, anyone who provides moderate criticism basically just gets ignored. Also, we are such a minority of the player base its egotistical to think we have some profound influence on the direction of things. At best, we offer the occasional good idea or feedback in the form of how mad/happy the player base is with a recent change.\n\nStill, I do agree that more discussions in general would be beneficial. Most people who start threads generally don't start unbiased ones and instead start something that one side agrees with and defends while the other side attacks. Rarely do good topics get started that are neutral like, \"What do you think about the complexity of the crafting system?\", for example. Instead it's, \"Why can't I fooking put an mp5 and a mosin together to make a machinegun? The crafting system sucks balls.

{"body": "She goes overboard in (many) places, I don't deny it. but the core point is actually very solid: when it comes to the question of whether or not Islam poses a serious danger to life across the world, the answer has to be yes because a noticeable percentage (whatever that percentage may be) of its adherents are so-called \"extremists\" who are actively antithetical to values that you and I would probably both consider to be basic human rights.\n\n15-25% is quoted as being an estimate by \"several intelligence agencies\", without further citation so I'll readily accept that it's not a statistic to lean on. And sure, I bet you could reduce it down to less than 1% if you applied a sufficiently stringent definition of the word \"extremist\", and by the same token you could bump it up to nearly two thirds with a sufficiently liberal one. But let's assume for a second that it's, oh... five percent instead.\n\n5% of 1.8 billion people is still about ninety million people. Imagine if the entire population of the UK teamed up with the entire population of Australia and together they thundered a mighty \"U WOT M8\" and set about waging war on you with fanatical devotion and as much materiel as they could muster. Whatever happens next, a lot of people are going to wind up dead and the world will be forever changed, even if the rest of the English-speaking world collectively shake their heads and explain that not all English-speakers are violent extremists.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening with Islam. If I had a one in twenty chance of dying every time I got in my car, I wouldn't even own one. If my doctor informed me that my operation has a 5% complication rate, I'd look at other treatments. A rollercoaster where 5% of the riders are thrown off to plunge fifty feet onto solid concrete would rightly be considered a deathtrap.\n\nSo how come a religion where some estimates place the *conservative* end of their rate of extremist at **triple** that deathtrap percentage gets a free pass just because the majority of its practitioners are peaceful and lovely people? That's like saying \"I'm sorry to hear about your wife and children Mr. Smith but if it's any consolation, the nineteen other flights that took off from the same airport that hour all landed safe and sound\".\n\nAre we really going to be that condescending as to say that the other 95% are worthy of any particular respect just for behaving like decent human beings? Is that how low we're setting the bar here? The fact that the sentence \"most Muslims are peaceful\" *even needs to be uttered* is very telling: If the problem didn't exist, then that sentiment would go without saying.\n\nShe's damn right that the entire community needs to be held accountable for the radical fringe. They're the ones from which that fringe arises, they're the ones who fail to police and restrain their own (usually) sons from going down that path. They're the ones who lack the collective backbone to say \"no, I will not permit you to sully our religion any longer\", who whine that \"*I am a peaceful happy Muslim*\" as if that somehow exonerates the entire religion.\n\nAll it does is exonerate the individual person. Islam as a whole remains culpable, just like while the guy selling the hot dogs isn't guilty of negligent manslaughter, the theme park as a whole **is**.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404606717", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

So get friends.\n\nWanna get rid of that pesky ESF? One lock on won't hurt. Fire suppression is a powerful thing which was, honestly, buffed more than it needed to be. But get 3 of them? Unless he's running flares (which, if he's realized how strong fire suppression is, he probably isn't), he's a dead man. Get enough people, and you instagib tanks, liberators, every vehicle that we detest fighting against.\n\nThe problem is that we balance things around the zerg. The liberators got overbuffed to make them easier to use, then got nerfed to a place that was on par or worse than where they started. We need to stop it. We need to balance around team work, and make it *extremely, excruciatingly, painfully clear* that we are doing so. You can run in an open squad, play with an outfit, or hell, even organize a temporary squad to C4 sundies or similar small objectives. If you don't want to be part of a team in a team based game, then that's fine. Be a lone wolf. But you'll never be as effective as you could be, and when the big bad vehicles come to touch you (and they will... *shudders*), you won't have anybody to work with.\n\nTL;DR I hear people complain about certain things being OP a lot, when the counter to them is teamwork. But nobody seems to use that. Vehicles are the easiest go to example, but it's 2:23, I have to wake up in 6 hours, and don't want to elaborate on other examples.

{"body": "**Anderz** *Current Winning Player*\n\n\"We did frickin' fine in Episode 2, I'm hope I don't jinx myself, but I'm hoping to do just as good in the next one.\" Gold and gold everywhere for Anderz. \"Holy Mamoley.\" And then we get even more gold, and Anderz bursts into giggles. \"This is just too good to be true!\" Anderz has weather off, so we don't hear the booming thunder. Anderz doesn't immediately believe Generik's /me and sees that several people are falling ahead and behind the back. \"Again, I have more gold than I have apples!\" Season 6 all over again. A Skeleton shoots Anderz from far away to .5. He finds more gold to make up for it though. There's two apples in Anderz's inventory and the gold for four apples. \"I'm sorry if I'm sounding very smug here...but things are coming up Anderz.\" They sure are. There are mob noises, but it's no issue for Anderz. With only two string, there's not much Anderz can do as far as range. Like he uses a bow anyways. He completely misses Millbee's death but sees him leaving. \"Maybe some technical difficulties for him, not sure why.\" Anderz wonders if he should go to the Nether and immediately decides to do so. \"I've never gone to the Nether in a UHC before.\" You were there with Team Potty Mouths in Season 9. Anderz heads in, hoping no one else had been there. He emerges at a different location than Pakratt's portal. He sees a Fortress immediately and heads right in, and finds a Blaze Spawner. A Blaze lights him on fire, and an apple heals Anderz to 9. Lag comes and the game freaks, and Anderz gets Blaze damage to 7.5 and heals to 9.5. Another Blaze and he's at 8.5. Anderz gets two Blaze Rods and bails at 8.5. Entirely reckless, but the Absorption covered him. Now Anderz searches for Nether Wart and gets it.\n\n**GenerikB** *Current Losing Player*\n\nGenny's title is 'LOL Weather Volume Slider' which is pretty funny. Generik's inventory is the worst inventory I think I have ever seen in UHC. I don't even understand. Rain starts and it's already pretty loud for the hermit. Generik sees Anderz is a sheater and types in the /me command. \"That'll get some stupids.\" So far confirmed stupid: Seth, MC, Pakratt. Generik finds another cave as the thunder booms, and it sounds nice because he's right under the surface so the rain is also picking up on sounds. There's Zombies everywhere (it's actually a Zombie Spawner), and a Baby Zombie runs up on Generik and #reks him to 4.5. There's not even a chest for Generik. He pokes his head out and gets it shot off to four hearts. Outside a Zombie hits him to 3 hearts and lightning strikes and a Spiders rush up on Generik. He's at 1.5. Two Zombies and Generik is at one lonely heart. Millbee is blown up by a Creeper and Generik takes refuge in his tree. \"This friggin stuff man!\" With one heart, Generik makes a bow and makes a run back to the cave. \"We can turn this around, believe or not. You think we can't, but we absolutely can. We for sure can.\" Generik tries to clear his inventory but the stuff keeps coming back. Generik turns them off and it's over. Staircasing down, Generik gets five gold. \"At this point: anybody's game!\" Uh-huh. Digging down, Generik says this is why Millbee died first in Captive Minecraft II. There's mobs everything, and Generik is two taps from following Millbee. Sunshine returns and Generik starts looking for Swampples. \"I don't care if people know I'm here, I hope they do and are afraid. Very afraid.\" I don't see Generik surviving Episode 4.\n\n**Arkas**\n\nAfter six hours, we are back at the recap train with Arkas. I'm sorry these have taken a bit, but I'm quite busy and there's just so many videos. Arkas is jelly of other's Diamonds, and sees a Creeper. \"You Wot M8?\" Creeper starts to blow up and Arkas freaks out, and kills it. The thunder happens and Arkas says his ears are getting pounded, but it was way louder in other videos. Arkas calls out Anderz for sheating and is not fooled by Generik. \"He just messin'.\" Arkas finds an Abandoned Mineshaft and Melon Seeds, which will be critical as it seems there's no jungle on this map. Arkas just can't even as far as the thunder is concerned. Arkas finds Emeralds but there are monsters. \"Fuck me man, do you want me to get a heart attack or something game?\" Millbee dies and Arkas goes \"oh no, Millbee! Baaaaaahhhh! Death by Creeper, the worst, the worst there is.\" No experience here. Arkas starts World Cup talk but it goes nowhere. A Skeleton menaces Arkas and he becomes the third guy after Kurt and Nebris to take a hit and have armor absorb it. Still at 10. To make up for it, another guy shoots him to 9 in one hit. \"You fucking kidding me? I'm done with this cave.\" Arkas heads back into a nearby Taiga and sees cobble pillars. They're Beef's from Episode 2. Arkas finds a Ravine and knocks a Millbee in. Anderz gets a Blaze Rod as Arkas sees a Skeleton below. \"Kill the Swede!\" \n\n**SethBling**\n\nSkipped Seth, sorry Seth. Let's see what he's doing to match the pace set by Anderz. Seth's goal is to get the string for the bow before he heads to the surface. Seth has decided on Diamond Armor instead of a sword as they are the same melee but armor has a boost in the ranged. The ThunderPocalypse starts as Seth finds some gold pieces. \"I can't, what is with this thunder. Is this a bukkit thing?\" Maybe, Season 8 was on bukkit and had similar thunder craziness. \"Oh my goodness...the B-Team betrayal. Damn. GG. That's the first death of UHC 17.\" Seth finds a bunch of Diamonds and Guude tells him it was a /me. \"Well then. Well then. I got fooled.\" Seth gets some string and has a bow now, something Justis League didn't have in Season 16 until they took out Parents (with Seth dying). Power I bow for Seth, and he quickly suggests clearing if all twenty people agreed. Seth turns weather to 39% and starts getting flint, he's excited now. Seth's playing one of the cleanest games I've ever seen. Millbee is blown up and Seth sees the '19 players remain' part of the plug-in he wrote. It's really embarrassing the /me got him as it was missing his own plug-in marker. I'm really liking Seth's commentary, you're doing a great job in your style. The storm ends and Seth heads top side, taking a Diamond Sword anyway. Baby Zombies try to impeded Seth's staircase, and a Skeleton drops in on Seth as he reaches the surface. Like Kurt, Nebris, and Arkas, his armor absorbs a blow. He hears water being poured on obsidian and footsteps. \"There can't be a person.\" It might've been rain on a lava lake. Seth figures it out. A Baby Zombie is still on the surface. Seth sees that Anderz has a Blaze Rod and is already thinking that range will be better in a fight against him or it'll be BTC v Etho over again. Seth digs up and #reks a Baby Zombie.\n\n**Vechs**\n\nWith pretty much no resources, Vechs gets an iron chestplate together and pants along with a bucket. Just as Vechs heads onto the surface, the thunderstorm starts as Vechs wonders if mobs can spawn in the storm. Vechs feels cold IRL and is excited but skeptical of Generik's 'death'. Vechs sees a Creeper on the surface and a Zombie starts warping to him and he's at 8.5. Vechs sees a cave and a Spider in front of it and gets two string, and decides to hunt for another spider. Lightning strikes six blocks away from Vechs. Not as close as it being one-two blocks from Just-Defy in Season 7. Vechs sees a Village in the distance and changes the plan to a Village raid. A Spider warps to Vechs and he has the string for a bow and is at 7. The Village has nothing of use, it's been seen by many a player. I'd be interested in seeing the Overview. Just as Generik made the church here his home, Vechs makes a home his home. Vechs makes a real bow, and this kind of Village sheltering was last done by the BAND in Season 13 I think. Might be wrong as I missed some of Season 14. Vechs says the lag is fair as everyone is suffering, but that's not true. Vechs' three hearts of damage have been bullshit. Vechs goes out to get crops and flees as a Creeper tracks him and lightning crashes. \"This feels like my first month of Minecraft.\" Carrots are not cookable to Vechs' great shock. Grilled carrots? It's from his Don't Starve experience Vechs says. Vechs wonders about how he should gauge his performance, and there other metrics than winning to a 'good' season. Vechs then trolls Aureylian.\n\n**Aureylian**\n\nWith Aurey being very adamant about her UHC skills, I have developed a feeling. My gut says that Aureylian will get 2nd. She is deep in a cave trying to get materials and finding bupkis. Full Iron though. Thunder starts and Aureylian is back on dat grind. Aurey feels sad that she completely missed Generik being slain by Bdubs, looking at the chat to see it, totally missing the /me. There's really not much to talk about, thunder cave, now has a bow and an iron sword, and Aureylian caving at 6.5. She shoots a Skeleton, \"suck it!\" Millbee dies and Aureylian is sad, not even realizing that Generik still lives. There's some gold that she is going to attempt to get it. Potentially maybe. \"This is like the worst storm in UHC history, what the heck is going on?\" Aureylian's first solo UHC is going well. A Spider jumps on Aureylian. \"What the Fu---there were a lot of profane words almost screamed right now--hell no I'm not going that way--hell no, no, no. The hell.\" Aureylian's at 6. Another Spider of crazy and she's at 5.5. There's a Skeleton right near Aurey that she hits into lava. \"Why, oh God, I hate this game, WHY!\" There are Zombies all around Aureylian and she kills them all, and is at 5.5. More gold. Aureylian tells the guys that she's going to stay in her cave for lols, and goes \"oh God\" at the mention of the Spider Mic by Vechs.\n\n**Sevadus**\n\nLast one for the night, I'll get the non-Mindcrackers tomorrow. Now with six Diamonds, Sevadus is 'feeling like a boss'. He is quite happy but realizes that he needs a book from 'upstairs'. Sevadus is thinking about the Nether for Strength Potions, but doesn't know if it's worth the risk. The thunder starts. \"Oh jeez, it's raining outside, or somebody died.\" The thunder is just so crazy. \"GENERIKB WAS SLAIN BY BDOUBLEO, AND THERE IT IS. RIP. RIP. RIP. Is that B-Team, oh my gosh?\" And another one in the fools category. \"He killed him in the middle of a storm, how freaking epic, seriously.\" MC actually killed Mhykol on the surface during a thunderstorm in Season 8. Sevadus mines a block above him to move in a cave and two Diamonds show up. \"Oh my God! Jesus! That is awesome!\" Sevadus now has five Diamonds. \"I'm looking for Diamonds, I'm looking for the win, I'm looking to destroy.\" Taking a look at TAB, Sevadus has a confidence boost. Sevadus mines some iron for kicks and breaks into a massive gold vein. Millbee gets blown up by a Creeper. \"Oh no! MILLBEE! GG to Millbee. G-G to Mill-Bee.\" Sevadus says these words: \"I have no idea what the fuck I am doing.\" And gets shot by a Skeleton to 7 instantly. Another ceiling glance, five more gold. Another Skeleton hits Sevadus to 6 and he says that now is not the time to surface. Sevadus just can't quit caving as Diamonds are on his mind. BlingBling. More cave exploration, more Gary Coleman avoidance. He makes one fall in lava and the jazzing outro happens.\n\n**Coestar**\n\nAlright, these recaps have taken some time, but I'm staying true to my personal goal that if I start an episode's recaps I finish them before the next episode's release. Coe kills a Creeper and continues to explore at 3 hearts. A storm begins and Coe remembers his poor carrot he planted. \"Holy frickin' crap.\" The thunder is real for Coe, and he just turns it off. Coe sees chat freaking out and reads that Generik was pulling a fake-out, and chuckles. There's some block repop for Coe but it doesn't do damage like it did to BTC. The cave just is ending with gold and Diamonds for Coe. \"Oh shiiii,\" is Coe's response to Millbee death. \"Please don't let that happen to me.\" Coe kills a Skeleton and man is he nervous and a lightning strike goes off. \"Oh shit.\" \"Any encounter with anybody right now is not going to be good for me.\" Staircasing leads to a pick breaking for Coe and reaching Bedrock. But there's a Spider tracking him, so Coe goes on the sound hunt. It's a dead end where the Spider was, but there's some gold for Coe. Coe falls a bat's squeaks to a massive ravine. \"The worst thing that could happen here is for something to drop on me.\"\n\n**Captain Sparklez**\n\nCaptain Sparklez is jazzed that he has made it two episodes and is hoping that the Witch has been dealt with. He has no armor at all, but has been doing well. The thunderstorm begins, and Captain Sparklez correctly calls out that mobs will spawn topside. Captain Sparklez checks TAB and says that it's pretty rough for Pakratt at half-a-heart. He's collecting the torches he's placed, that doesn't seem like the best plan, but okay. Captain Sparklez sees the people doing better than him and marks them as 'do not mess with'. After missing all the Generik flimflammery, Captain Sparklez takes Nebris' bed comment seriously and replies in chat as such. Wondering about UHC strats, Captain Sparklez gets sniped to 8 by a Skeleton as he GG's Millbee. Now with actual armor, Captain Sparklez is much better equipped even though he's running low on cave. Captain Sparklez heads to the surface and a Skeleton shoots him in the back to 7.5. \"Honestly I'm probably just going to die to mobs. Shouldn't have gone above ground.\" Captain Sparklez wanders on a Village that I think Baj found. \"Hello Mr. Testificate.\" Testificate, now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. There's a nearby cave opening and he goes 'Hello, housekeeping'. Where's that from? I've heard Kurt say that too. The storm stops and Captain Sparklez can wander around in peace. \"What a day.\" Seeing the 'Into Fire', Captain Sparklez says \"RIP to my hopes and dreams, we do have to kill him but I'm not sure we'll be able to.\" Melons are growing.\n\n**Millbee**\n\n*In reply*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404766576", "subreddit": "mindcrack", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

This suggests that without flesh, a wight is just as dead as anything else. Also explains why burning the dead stops them from coming back. It suggests skeletal wights aren't a thing as far as the books are concerned.

In addition, Prime Minister Abe claimed that the Class A war criminals \"are not war criminals under the laws of Japan\".  \n\nBut no its all vitriolic anti-Japanese propaganda isnt it? \n\n&gt; How is refuting anti-Japanese sentiments not doing a good job of protecting the Japanese people? \n\nProbably due to the way they refute it: \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1544471/Japanese-PM-denies-wartime-comfort-women-were-forced.html\n\nhttp://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2010/01/24/life/the-wartime-leaders-of-japan-were-heroes/\n\nhttp://japandailypress.com/nagoyas-mayor-kawamura-continues-to-deny-nanjing-massacre-0226229/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Official_apologies\n\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-16/news/mn-3020_1_official-visits\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22519384\n\n&gt; If Japan admits to the claims, it would mean both sides are in accord that the Xiao Riben are in need of 'correcting'\n\nImplying by denying those claims it will protect Japan from that happening. Oh wait it is happening already and you know why? It is because of Japan's denial of these crimes that is almost universally recognized by all of Japan's neighbors including her main ally the United States that is causing this to happen.\n\n&gt;Kids are being bullied for being of Japanese descent but whatever that's fine who cares stupid kids just learn some karate you dolphin eating rapists\n\nKids all around the world can be bullied because of their \"descent\". So pls dont feel too special about it. \n\n&gt; I'm reflecting views of many Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans, liberal and conservative, whose voices and concerns are being ignored by the international community.\n\nProbably due to lack of facts and credible evidence to support your people's claims. Like what is happening with you right now. \n\nAnd also I have spoken with a lot of Japanese people/friends who came from Japan in Australia regarding this issue and none of them deny that comfort women happened because of the IJA, which either proves that they are logical human being like me or that they too have been brainwashed by vitriolic anti-Japanese propaganda implanted by the super evil international community. \n\n&gt;Again with this vacuum. As if China hasn't been and isn't also inflaming issues with India, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Korea, and Taiwan. \n\nOh and I bet that gives your government the excuse to deny historical facts that is almost universally recognized eh? That's literally like saying America should deny mistreatment of Japanese American citizens in WW2 because modern Japan is killing a lot of whales. \n\n&gt; Ooh boy you know some Japanese people\n\nCan't deny it, they are amazing people. \n\n&gt;hopefully these little impressionable lamb-like humanoids don't become like Shinden the Uyo.\n\nU wot m8? \n\n&gt; Because if Japanese people just all bow down to their Chinese and Korean overlords\n\nOh no so us Australian have been bowing down to our Aboriginal overlords the whole time because we apologized sincerely for the \"[Stolen Generation] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations#Australian_federal_parliament_apology)\"? Damn it I should have known that being a decent human being was an act of total submission... \n\n&gt;the former comfort women finally feel satisfied\n\nYeah they probably most likely would. I mean come on don't those poor human being deserve some respect and dignity for what they have been through?\n\n&gt; things like the South China Sea disputes, Tibetan Independence, Uighur independence, the Taiwan strait issue, Nepal, India and all other issues will just wash away, and Asia will sing kumbaya for the rest of eternity. \n\nNo Jon Snow, Japan must deny crimes that is almost universally recognized by all of Japan's neighbors including her main ally the United States for that to happen. \n\n&gt; Until then let's make sure So Far from the Bamboo Grove is never read by another American student again, and all textbooks call it the \"East Sea\"!\n\nNah lets not, the world is filled with too much decent human beings who chooses to embrace history/fact rather than to ignore it for that to happen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404977268", "subreddit": "japan", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "#The West\n\n* Strong Belwas vs. **Randyll Tarly**; a renowned knight with Valyrian Steel, trained from a young age in the art of war. No question on this one.\n\n* Tormund Giantsbane vs **Areo Hotah**; Areo is one of my sleepers to take this whole thing. He's a brute, and a damn good one. He'll hack his way through a lot of the bracket.\n\n* Stannis vs **Jaqen**; how the Mannis made it past a legendary knight from the age of heroes baffles me, but he did. He'll fall to Jaqen's craftiness.\n\n* **Bloodraven** vs Jon Snu; Sorry Jon, you're my boy and could someday save the realm, but you're going against the greatest warg of all time. He'll unleash countless arrows upon you as you draw near, and when you finally get in close he's got his Dark Sister to match your Long Claw. Jon, you should have fallen to Bittersteel, but now you can fall to his half brother.\n\n* **Sandor** vs Aegon; Assuming he isn't on Balerion, I don't know much of Aegon's prowess. Sandor has proven himself time and time again. \n\n* Lyanna vs **Darkstar**; Lyanna over Edd? Sure I can buy that, she used to best Benjen. Lyanna over Darkstar? A trained knight, one who is reported by others to be at least  as competent as a kingsguard.\n\n* **Deamon** the Warrior Incarnate vs Halfhand; Neat-o, Qhorin intentionally lost to Jon. Deamon Blackfyre is a fookin [LEGEND](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_Blackfyre).\n\n* **Loras Pretty Boy** vs Wun Wun; Giants are cool and all, but they are none to bright. As we see, Loras was able to trick and upset the Mountain that rides, I think he match a Giant.\n\n#The East\n\n* **Victarion** vs Brandor; Sorry, but a summer child green as grass who got bested by his 9 year old sister in the yard isn't going to take one of the craziest mother fuckers we've seen. He is the Kraken incarnate to me. \n\n* **Ned** vs Asha; While I believe the Ironborn are a great warrior society, I think their strength comes from their reaver mentality, preying on the weak. Ned, trained from a young age alongside the might King Robert is no slouch. I don't see him going far in the tourney, but he does not fall here.\n\n* **Brienne** vs Other; I assume Valyrian steel trumps the sword shattering aspect. Brienne will have her metal tested, and it will prove tempered.\n\n* Howland Reed vs **The Dragonknight**; come on, a scrawny crannogmen who sends his young children to handle his dirty work is no match for a member of the Kingsguard, and a renowned member at that.\n\n* **Bronn** vs Greyworm; the phalanx is a great strategy in warcraft. It is not useful in one on one combat. Their skills are comparable, but Bronn's sheer force of will allows him to live to fight another day.\n\n* **Thoros** vs Coldhands; Thoros should not be in this round, but since he is he takes coldhands easily with his fire sword.\n\n* **Rhaegar** vs Mag the Mighty; this is a tough one. I believe Rhaegar was competent at arms. I believe Robert could kill a giant in his prime, would even revel in the opportunity. I do not believe he handily defeated Rhaegar at the Trident, but did so with at least some effort. Rhaeger into the sweet 16.\n\n* The match we've all been waiting for. For this I will make some assumptions, they are as follows; 1. Ser Strong == Gregor Clegane in prowess and strength. 2. Ser Strong will fight as if it is life or death, even though I believe he has no life to lose. 3. Duncan has been through at least the first three novellas of his story, and is mounted on Thunder.\n\nAs Egg helped Dunk don his mail he couldn't help but wonder if this would be the outfit he died in. He did not wish it to be so, but he knew that anything could happen on the fields. As his breastplate was fastened he resigned himself to a grim determination. His foe was certainly formidable, but Dunk the Lunk was thick as a castle wall and he would allow his opponent to crash against him like waves on the beach. He took his shield garnered with his proper elm, and exited his tent.\n\nAs he drew near the grounds, the noise was raucous, and Dunk knew that all the great lords of the Realm had come to witness a true dance to the death. He entered the short fence that stood for their enclosing atop his aging destrier Thunder. With sword sheathed, lance and shield in hand, faced the man who he must kill today. He was garnered all in white, as befit a knight of the Kingsgaurd. Atop his helm was a plume of feathers, the color of the seven, and on his shoulders his cloak was clasped using two seven pointed stars. These are where normalities ended, and the odd began. This was a man of enormous size, even to Dunk. He stood almost nine feet, and in armor it seemed even greater. His girth was greater than Dunks, and he seemed to wield his gigantic size with an eerie rigidness. Dunk could only hope this rigidity would show when the steel began to ring. Finally, the King stood and made his commencement, but Dunk could not hear for the harmonic buzzing that had started as his heart quickened.\n\nWhen the King had finished, the two Knights took each other in for nearly long enough to catch one's breath, and then the sound of hooves broke the palpable tension. Dunk could feel Thunder taking great breaths beneath him, and he could feel as the great warhorse gathered steam. As he drew near the great behemoth in white, Dunk couched his lance for the one and only pass they would get. Hoping to end the fight quickly, Duncan aimed to unseat his foe so he could use his mount to his advantage. He looked for a square strike to the breastplate as the first pass was made, but his foe outmatched him with lance. The great white knight dropped his shoulder just enough for the blow to glance away with little harm done. At the same instance he steadily put his lance point directly into Duncan's chest, delivering a blow that rattled his teeth and shattered the lance. Dunk held on to his reigns, but dropped his lance. Turning to face his foe, he unsheathed his sword. Once again, the two great men made haste for one another.\n\nAs the distance closed, Dunk's mood grew dire. He saw in an instant his foe wielded a greatsword in a single hand. Knowing immediately that he was outmatched, Duncan began to look for a chink in the blinding white army of his enemy. The two met near the center of the ground, and began the dance. The white knight began his assault with great, broad strikes coming from his forehand and overhead. The man was freak strong, and Dunk only survived by forcing the blows to glance away and bounce of his plate. He parried every advance, but was soon growing tired. He knew he must do something to take an advantage or else lose his life. \n\nIn an act of desperation, Dunk caught another blow from his foe on his shield giving it a great gash across the elm, at the same time he thrust his sword downward between his enemy's legs severing the spine of the horse causing it to crumple under its riders weight. The sound of the poor beast screaming made Dunk want to wretch, but he gained control of himself in time to see the white knight rise from the dust. He hardly seemed to notice his beast of burdens agony as he turned and faced Duncan once more. Dunk knew he had to act, so he spurred Thunder forward hoping to take his advantage. When Dunk was nearly close enough to strike, the knight moved with blinding speed, the point of his sword went up, as his torso went low. He evaded Dunk's attempt entirely, and was able to gut poor Thunder from end to end. The horse went ass end up, and threw Dunk from the saddle. \n\nWroth with vengeance Dunk drew near his foe, prepared to repay the lose of his steed. The white knight was relentless in his approach as well, the two men met once again for what would be the end of one. The ringing of steel could be heard for miles, as two brutish men traded blows with vicious ferocity. Dunk was catching the strikes of the white knight, and even managing to return and feint in his own. He was holding on, but he could feel the toll it was taking on him. His arms grew tired, and his legs began to shake beneath him. His sword was moving more slowly, and he feared that soon he would be *too* slow. If he was going to act, he had to act now. Dunk dropped his guard, and shuffle backwards in a hopstep. His ever relentless foe drew forward once again, raising his greatsword in a single hand, and as he did, Dunk saw it. His foe was truly a great swordsman, but he seemed to only press. He worked only to his fore, and had no awareness of his rear. This would be his only shot. As the white knight brought his sword down in a great arc, Ser Duncan the Tall proved he did possess some grace. With a forward roll and tuck, Dunk was behind his foe and on his feet. He knew that standing he could not match this man, so he did what Flea Bottom had taught him too and took the behemoth around the waist. \n\nAs the two met the ground in a tumultuous  crash, the feathered helm of his foe came unclasped and bounced away to be forgotten. Dunk, caught in his battle fury, sword still in hand ran his foe through by driving the point underneath his breastplate on his back. Much as he had done to his foe's horse Dunk severed the spine of the great white knight. Knowing his foe would not rise quickly from the blow, Dunk took his feet and finally saw what the crowd had already noticed. Beneath the helm of this soiled knight their laid nothing but a severed neck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405453874", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "* **Strong Belwas** vs Randyll Tarly - Trained pitfighter that shits on everyone in a literal sense versus a great tactician. Because this is not a field battle between armies I give the edge to Belwas.\n  \n* Tormund Giantsbane vs **Areo Hotah** - I'd say Hotah though Tormund is one of my favourite characters. Both have grown up in war but I don't think Tormund will be able to defeat Hotah considering his armor and weapon of choice, Dorne's fighting style is completely unheard of by wildlings.\n\n* Stannis Baratheon vs **Jaqen H'ghar** - How is this even a contest? Stannis had never been a great warrior, he was okay at best. Jaqen H'gar learned Arya how to waterdance AND was a renowned man of the Night's Watch, he even lead a sellsword company in Essos and is the Motherfucker of dragons. All jokes aside I still think he wins this.\n\n* **Brynden \"Bloodraven\"** Rivers vs Jon Snow - Jon Snow, the guy that never really did anything worthwhile with his sword apart from beating up rapists, would never match up to one of the heroes of the Blackfyre rebellion.\n  \n* **Sandor Clegane** vs Aegon \"The Conqueror\" Targaryen - Aegon's actual fighting capabilities have never really been mentioned and I think dragons are OP. I don't include dragons for that reason and that's why Sandor Clegane wins.\n  \n* **Lyanna Stark** vs Gerold \"Darkstar\" Dayne - I personally estimate Lyanna Stark to be similar to Arya, and little girls would probably be able to beat wannabe batman.\n  \n* **Daemon Blackfyre** vs Qhorin Halfhand - Totally Daemon, the dude was supposed to fight like the warrior himself when wielding Blackfyre!  \n  \n* Loras Tyrell vs **Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun** - Loras, while able to knock people from horses, would probably go down to one sweep of Wun Weg Wun Wun Wun Wun Wun Wun Wun(wun?).\n  \n* Victarion Greyjoy vs **Bran Stark, via Hodor** - Victarion would be too cocky. Hodor would take him by the legs and throw him off the ship. Because Victarion wears armor when on ships he'll sink and drown.\n  \n* Eddard Stark vs **Asha Greyjoy** - Asha just seemed like more of a warrior to be honest. Though I am still surprised how she survived the previous round. I guess she's just more popular ;_;\n  \n* **Brienne of Tarth** vs An Other - She has dragonsteel. While Others are absolutely fearsome creatures, all their power lies in that! The only thing they really got going for themselves is their body being steel resistant. Brienne wields Valyrian steel at her prime and is thus in the advantage.\n  \n* Howland Reed vs **Aemon \"Dragonknight\" Targaryen** - He's a fookin' legend \n  \n* **Bronn** vs Grey Worm - Bronn is a duelist, Grey Worm is a person that fights in coordinated groups and would never have the 1v1 quickscope experience that Bronn has.    \n  \n* Thoros of Myr vs **Coldhands** - Though he'd probably have to kill Thoros like 10 times.\n  \n* Rhaegar Targaryen vs **Mag the Mighty** - Rhaegar was a good knight, but he was a knight. I don't see how a knight on an open field where the Giant can use his full reach potential could ever win.\n  \n* Robert Strong vs **Ser Duncan the Tall** - Robert Strong is probably pretty stupid\n  \n\n  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405457651", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I fail at life.  So I bought WoW vanilla back in the day, and apparently I fail at WoW too.\n\nSeemed like I played for fooking ever and got up to level 40 or so, and had to concentrate on college.  Every time another expansion came out I would get the demo and play free for 10 days. or resub every now and then.\n\nI never knew anyone in real life who played it, so I solo'd everything.  I got in a guild and it was just a bunch of people of levels ranging 10-70 who didn't really talk much or help each other because we all did different things.  Somebody gave me 250g or whatever for flying mount training though.\n\nHighest I ever got was level 66.  No real exciting raid stuff.  So I would always just get bored solo grinding questing and sitting at the AH, so I quit.  I have a total of about 400 hours on that original char.  Fucking arathi highlands and stranglethorn vale.\n\nI moved out on my own and spent my late 20s trying to go out and \"have a life\" and never really did.  Going out to drink is very overrated.  I work, I do house projects, and I watch netflix.\n\nSo I'm on a 10 day trial for MoP right now.  Started a DK and I have him up to 62 now.  I may stick with it and try to max him out.  Maybe I'll FINALLY max a character and do all the end game stuff that all you geeks carry on about.  Much like people (with families now) reminiscing about how awesome their partying 20s were (and I think back on how mine weren't and wonder how I'm still single), people reminisce about how awesome WoW was, (and I think back about killing 20,000 rats wearing hats with my shitty warrior for 12 hours by myself).\n\ntl;dr:  My 20s weren't the awesome story most people talk about so I retreated to being a loser playing WoW.  Been on since Vanilla.  Never maxxed a char or did any uber cool raid stuff, so I feel like a failure at WoW too.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405636242", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Funny how most of my interpretations are the exact opposite, showing there is no right or wrong here, only what we want to create to bring the character to life in our heads.\n\nI found Little Finger's Batman impersonation unlikely for someone who is trying to keep a low profile.  His gravely whisper sounds too much like a villain (like Karl, the fooking legend) and wouldn't be the best choice to  conceal his true motives.\n\nDinklage, on the other hand, is a pleasant surprise, especially given the fact that a high-pitched voice (as if huffing helium) is a known physical trait of dwarfism.  How Dinklage dodged that genetic trait is a mystery, but thankfully so.  It is very difficult for me to imagine his more dramatic scenes (his trial, getting rid of Shae, or showdown with Tywin) being delivered in a munchkin, Oompa Loompa-like voice, like Herve Villechaize, Warwick Davis or 99% of all other dwarf actors.  Pete Dinklage, among being a brilliant actor, is also the James Earl Jones of dwarf actors for sure.\n\nI don't know if the actual tone of Clark's voice is a problem for me.  It's more of her lack of inflection, any time other than when she's angry (which becomes more gritty and gravely).  Her Valyrian seems to have more emotion than her english.  When she speaks english, she sounds as if she is reciting her lines off the page.  Very dry and monotoned.\n\nTo me, Kit is more about mumble than rumble.  He seems like he has a mouthful of marbles and is difficult to understand.  Not really an authoritative voice.  I imagined Snow (being the protagonist) as having a clear \"broadcast\" voice.  Jon's voice gets lost in a room full of murmuring, rather than cut through the crowd (like Tywin or Tyrion would).  Kind of reminds me of the way the Beatles mumbled when first arriving from Liverpool.  They were very difficult to understand when talking.\n\nI thought that Lysa's voice was perfect.  The way her voice squeaked and broke up when trying to toss Sansa out the moon door sounded like someone totally unhinged.\n\nI guess we all create the voices we think fit the character, which can be completely different for each person.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405702561", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The NES sold half as many units as the Wii U... thirty years ago. The entire seventh generation *combined* only scraped past the lifetime sales of the PS2 circa 2010. Even the Atari 2600 sold 25 million units - is one in ten American households not enough to qualify as \"mass market adoption?\" \n\nOn the wider point - the problem is a lack of middle-budget development. It doesn't actually take $100M to make a great game these days, as evidenced by the many zero-budget / single-developer titles that the internet loves, but getting people with money to acknowledge any middle ground whatsoever is apparently a Quixotic undertaking. There used to be many medium-sized studios with past successes and enough stability to risk $1M-$10M on a weird new title... until they were steadily swallowed up by the likes of EA. \n\nBehemoths like EA are the ones driving this \"as a service\" model, and the $100M budget expectations, and the $200M advertisement expectations. They're the rarified boardrooms where it's decided that precisely one franchise be aimed at anything besides the dudebro customer base they already have. They're the ones who, even in an era where anyone can access an audience of millions entirely free of charge, have convinced lesser investors that lesser investments are a fool's errand. DLC and F2P horseshit has given them a taste of 500% return-on-investment, and they refuse to be sensible ever again. \n\nIt has never been easier or cheaper to make a game than it is right now.

The reddit slang is actually u wot m8 which is just based off douchy british people yelling that.. I guess? I don't actually know. There is also u wot m7 which is just people being dumb cuz seven is less than 8 lol.\n\nAs far as ideas go, I had a few more actually :P. I think if we did one a week, one week out of the month should be reserved for FreeNight which is just a free game always so that nobody feels like they have to spend money to join in. Games like TF2 or similar. The other issue is not every game people wanna play is genna have large multiplayer: maybe they are co-op or singleplayer. Well if we do the discussion thing then that's still ok because the community part will just take place during the discussion. Or we just hop on a teamspeak server and talk even if we aren't in the same game together.

They go all the way to the Fist of the First Men and meet up with Qorin Half-Hand, a legendary ranger. He tells them that all the wildling tribes have joined together and are now one giant force. He tells them that he is going to get close and find out what is going on and Jon volunteers to go with him. They both leave with 2 other rangers, intent on finding the wildling \"army\". They capture a group of wildlings and leave Jon to kill one of them, Ygritte, the red headed girl. He can't do it, gets lost and then ends up getting caught by her and a group of wildlings led by the bones guy. They also have captured Qorin and are bringing the two of them to their leader, Mance Rayder, a former brother of the Nights Watch. Qorin tells Jon that a man inside Mance's army would be worth more than 1000 men outside, and then has Jon kill him to make it seem like Jon wants to join the wildlings. Jon meets Mance and tells him he wants to join their cause. As a test, Mance sends him with Tormund and others to climb the wall. The wildling army is going to attack Castle Black from both sides and the group Jon is with is tasked with climbing over the Wall and attacking from the front. So Jon ends up climbing the Wall with Tormund, Ygritte, and the others. \nThe Nights Watch on the other hand came into contact with White Walkers after Jon left, that is the last scene of season 2. Only a handful of them survive and they start heading back to the Wall, to inform everyone of what they've seen. They get to Crastors Keep, and a mutiny basically arises, led by Karl Tanner, the fookin' legend of Gin Alley. They kill Crastor, Lord Commander Mormont and basically take over the keep.

{"body": "Agreed.  If you see a behavior enough amongst a group of friends and you don't spend time with anyone else, it isn't \"weird,\" it's accepted.  It's the same reason most of the people who constantly mimic anime behavior do it: because that's the majority of the \"human\" interaction they see.\n\nPlenty of people on reddit speak in memes or repeat familiar responses (how often have you seen the spork comment, or \"This,\" or \"u wot m8,\" etc?).  They aren't creative or original, but most reddit users understand what the person is saying, or at least what they're trying to get across, because that's \"our\" familiar language.  The redditors who don't are probably people who spend more time in other social circles and read reddit infrequently.\n\nFor the hardcore Tumblr user, that lingo is awful, socially abhorrent threats of violence slung casually about as if the person on the other end of the conversation isn't a thinking human being, referring to anything that upsets you as a \"trigger,\" and expressing a blithe hatred of anyone who disagrees based on the assumption that they are white cis men (reddit's equivalent of ...um... well, I don't think we have a uniform target of hate that falls outside of the usual society-at-large ones).  \n\nTo be fair to most Tumblr users, I don't think they start out foaming bigots devoid of logic, but they get lured in by their love of a fandom (which Tumblr is still a popular platform for sharing), and then perhaps their emotions are appealed to over a report on the tragic plight of minorites, sans fact checking (racist statue of liberty, perhaps).

You play both sides of the fence.\n\nYou are contradictory constantly. You speak to the Star, but then accuse me of \"doxxing\" you because I followed *your* link that *you put there* on your Twitter page to your biz site. You also, after having accused me of \"doxxing\" you, state that you have nothing to hide. So why pretend that I am trying to hurt your business and accuse me of \"slander\" if you in fact have nothing to hide? In one breath you accuse people of racism and in the next claim that racism doesn't exist, becuase it is all \"White Supremecy\". You're a fucking revolving door. But you know what? None of this abstract ruminating does the tiniest fucking thing to help anyone. You need to absolve yourself of the bile in your belly. Well, get over yourself. You didn't put it there. Either did I. Clearly you haven't transcended it, though you recognize it. You are just as self righteous and damaging as anyone you accuse of those traits, if not more.

{"body": "**Ted:** Seriously dude, you should probably take a break. Its become a problem.\n\n**James:** u wot m8?\n\n**Ted:** See? Right there. You've started making Reddit jokes in everyday conversations.\n\n**James:** A joke's a joke, Ted. If it's funny on Reddit, it's funny in real life.\n\n**Ted:** But it's not *just* jokes. The other day you called me a fedora wearing neckbeard.\n\n**James:** Hah. Rekt.\n\n**Ted:** You're killing me.\n\n**James:** In all fairness, you *were* wearing a fedora.\n\n**Ted:** No. No I wasn't. That's why it didn't make sense. Even aside from that, you've been refreshing your browser for the past hour. Why? Why are you doing that?\n\n**James:** I'm just making sure this comment I made gets upvoted. Some dude asked if we could describe the plot of a movie in five words or less. I replied, \"Remorseless shark devours innocents, yet becomes idolized.\"\n\n**Ted:** Jaws?\n\n**James:** Wolf of Wall Street. I was speaking figuratively. \n\n**Ted:** Wasn't that seven words?\n\n**James:** I'm pretty sure the whole five words or less thing was more of a recommendation. By the way, mind logging in and upvoting me?\n\n**Ted:** Yeah, I'm not doing that. Upvotes literally mean nothing.\n\n**James:** Ugh, I hate the word 'literally'. No one uses it right. Its lost its original meaning.\n\n**Ted:** I'm not being figurative. They *literally* mean nothing.\n\n**James:** They feel good. When someone upvotes one of my comments, they're validating my thoughts, and by extension, myself as a whole.\n\n**Ted:** That just sounds unhealthy, man.\n\n**James:** ...Maybe it is. I've always had issues with validation... Listen, Ted. Did I ever tell you what happened to my dad?\n\n**Ted:** Wasn't he some sort of scientist?\n\n**James:** He was a marine biologist until he got fired. I was five at the time. He *loved* his job, Ted. It was his passion, and when he got fired, he couldn't find another job in his field. So he just didn't work. There was a lot of tension around the house after that. I dunno if the tension was caused by his drinking, or if he started drinking because of the tension - but he drank a *lot*.\n\n**Ted:** Shit, dude.\n\n**James:** I remember one day, while he was drunk, he uh.. he hit me. In the face. Kind of hard.\n\n**Ted:** Holy shit, I'm so sorry..\n\n**James:** Yeah. I got scared and called the police. They took him away. I didn't see him for years after that. I think my mom hated me for it. \n\n**Ted:** That's really fucked up dude.. You did the right thing. You shouldn't feel guilty.\n\n**James:** Thanks. But there's more. One day, when I was in middle school, I was at the grocery store parking lot with my mom. I saw him there, Ted.\n\n**Ted:** Your dad?\n\n**James:** Yeah. My mom didn't see, but I did. He was on the side of the street, and he was in bad shape. I barely recognized him. He looked homeless. \n\n**Ted:** What did you do?\n\n**James:** I walked up to him and said \"Dad?\" -because I used to call him 'Dad'.\n\n**Ted:** Yeah I figured. So what happened?\n\n**James:** He turned around and his eyes grew wide. He recognized me. And you know what he did?\n\n**Ted:** What?\n\n**James:** He hugged me, Ted. It was the validation I had been searching for ever since he left... But then... then...\n\n**Ted:** It's ok man, listen, if you don't want to talk about-\n\n**James:** No. I need to get this off my chest... He took me by the shoulders, leaned in close, and whispered something into my ear.\n\n**Ted:** What did he say?\n\n**James:** He said.. \"Son... Im-\" Sorry I should explain. He used to call me 'Son'. \n\n**Ted:** Yeah, I got that. So what did he say?\n\n**James:** With his hands on my shoulders, and tears in his eyes, he said \"Son... I'm a...\"\n\n**Ted:** ...It's ok man, take your time...\n\n**James:** ...He said \"I'm a...\" \n\n**Ted:** ...\n\n**James:** \"*I'mma need about tree fiddy.*\"\n\n**Ted:** ..God fucking dammit. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1406008508", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2193, "controversiality": 0}

If you don't use the programs frequently enough, put the shortcuts in a folder labeled \"Extra Programs\" or some such name.  If there are a handful you use frequently, pin them to your fookin' task bar!  That's what it's there for.  You can pin anything to the task bar, even a single file, if you use it frequently enough.  I have a couple of programs I use at work pinned to my task bar, and a folder containing 99% of everything I do from the network.  I can just click on that folder in the task bar, and boom, I can get to work easily.\n\n\nUnfortunately, my desktop on my work computer is a tad cluttered, only because I.T. at work has made it where I can't move shortcuts into a folder.  They put the shortcuts to certain programs on the desktop because apparently some people don't know how to add shortcuts on their own, pin to the task bar, or else the Start menu is an alien planet to them.\n\n\nI have shortcuts to Word and Excel on my desktop at work.  Thing is, I only open those up when I want to create a new file, which is very rare.  Most files I work with are preexisting.  One thing that bugs the hell out of me is seeing people open up Word or Excel first, then clicking on \"Open\" to get to the folder and file they need, then get pissed when they can't find the file.  Only time I might click on \"Open\" in Word or Excel is when I'm already in it, and want to open up another file.  But most of the time I don't do that; I tend to have a window with the folder one currently opened file came from, so I just open another.  Apparently some people at work never heard of Windows Explorer.  (\"Wait, isn't that what we use to browse the Internet?\" *Steps out and runs head on into a speeding 18-wheeler*)\n\n\nAh, well.

Also at an [8] right now, but I'm a fookin' legend, so Volvo please giff patience. ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ\n\nWhat if I told you that back in the days before Kony 2012, everyone knew that the most evil, fucked-up guys around were the Nazis? Even Colby refused to go near them. The Nazis were Germans who were /r/raisedbynarcissists, and their leader was literally Hitler. But they really wanted to get with this 10/10 called Europe and show her this trick they heard about jolly ranchers. The Germans even started and lost bout tree fiddy wars just trying to impress her (so meta), but nothing ever seemed to work. Hurt by getting friendzoned so many times by Europe, the Nazis took the red pill and tried to fuck that bitch right in the pussy.\n\nFor a few years, it went *okay*. The Nazis shit on Belgium, the Nazis rekt France, and Poland could not into defense. Germany even asked Italy and Japan if they were aware. Italy was like, \"does the Narwhal bacon at midnight?\", and Japan was like \"send photo.\" Romania was like \"and my axe!\" but Hungary said, \"nobody cares.\" In the end they all formed team OrangeRed and jimmies were rustled.\n\nFor few years there it looked like Germany was going to get Europe after all. But then Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and destroyed all of America's downboats. (Wow, front page!) Then Hitler and the Nazis were like, \"fuck yeah, death to America!\" So brave. \n\nBut then America was like, \"Do you want Marines? Because that's how you get Marines.\"  And shit got too real for me.  Germany was so thirsty for karma that they tried to invade Russia in the wintertime, which was lame because Napoleon had made the same exact post just a hundred and forty years before. But the Russians were on top of it, and after throwing like 12 million dead babies at the Nazis until they ran away, Hitler finally was like \"fuck this shit, my planet needs me!\" (Did he died?)\n\nAnd then the Marines showed up and it was /thread. 'MURICA liberated France, 'MURICA liberated Belgium. The Russians got Poland, and now is no hope in Poland, only potato. The Nazis all died, or turned back into Germans again, and they've been winning soccer games ever since. \n\nYeah... you like that, you fucking retard?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406126039", "subreddit": "explainlikeIAmA", "score": 646, "controversiality": 0}

Punish game is king in Melee, but Project M has a metagame about it more akin to brawl where a percent lead is more important. Its faster, sure, but that doesn't stop it from being slower than melee (by a wide margin)\n\nwhat are you even going on about? You didn't even refute my argument, you just called me ignorant and listed a bunch of top level players. Then you told me I was riding the PMBR's dick (which is hilarious since I was just criticizing PM), and finally you went off on some random tangent about 3-stocks. \n\n&gt;your argument is very poorly constructed\n\nThey hypocrisy is real. I have no idea why you randomly began to talk about how you think PM is a slower game (despite the average match time being about the same as melee) and some BS about percent leads being more important than stock leads (if not more important than stocks, then I don't know what you're talking about at all, because percent lead when at same stocks is just as important in melee as it is in PM)\n\n&gt;and you're the type of player that M2K was talking about.\n\nThank you for randomly insulting me even though you've never seen me play ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406130883", "subreddit": "SSBPM", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

So I think it makes sense for Karl to hyperbolize himself and make himself into a monster - because he feels like otherwise, he'll never be a fookin legend.\n\nThat could just be reading too much into it, though.

{"body": "Gandhi opened up what the stranger called a \"laptop\". It was shiny and had a bitten apple on it. He recoiled as it shone into his eyes and revealed what looked like a drawing or picture. at the center of the drawing there was a little animal it looked like with an antenna of sorts. Some sort of insect perhaps. The stranger reached over and started rubbing his finger on rectangular area below a jumble of letters and numbers. There was a *click* and suddenly the picture changed before his eyes. Gandhi looked over to the stranger in confusion and a little fear. The stranger was hidden in the shadows but he could make out a trench coat and what looked like a fedora. His figure was very large and he breathed heavily. He could use a good hunger strike, Gandhi thought. Quite possible a shower as well.\n\nGandhi looked back at the screen and tried to make sense of what he saw. There were tiny pictures with text next to them. Gandhi went down the list and read some of them. \"TIFU by recording porn of myself when I was a teenager and then forgetting about it\". What is this sick place? Gandhi thought, disturbed by what he was seeing. He tried to get up from his chair but realized he was chained to it. Fear crept into him. He tried to break free but to no avail, so he decided to try and remain calm. He heard a weird noise come from the stranger. He seemed to be saying \"Lol\". Then he heard the stranger say \"Lol noob\" What was this strange language?\n\nThe stranger reached over and started pressed the letters. reddit.com/r/civcirclejerk appeared near the top of the picture and then suddenly the picture changed again. Suddenly he could see his own face in the background of the picture.

People often talked about the game was hard to enter as a rookie, and even hardcore players agreed. There needed to be added accessibility, but Blizzard didn't add accessibility, they made the game easier and removed a huge part of the social aspect of WoW.\n\nLFD, LFR, Flying Mounts, Removal of Attunements, Resistance Gear requirements - all these things you see as \"trivial barriers to playing the game\" was actually something that got people together because it was a requirement to advance.

{"body": "I don't really have too much experience with CW/companies, but AFAIK, out of the lines I listed, T62A is the most viable for CW, as well as Obj. 140 which you can research from T-54 on your way to 62a. IS-7, E-100 and T110E5 are also used, though not very often. Other tanks used in CW are BatChat 25t , T57 Heavy and sometimes even Leo 1, however, I would not recommend these for a beginner, since they are either autoloaders (T57 line), very fragile (Leo on tiers IX and X) or both (Batchat line). T110E4 might be useful in CW as well. However, as I said, I don't play CW, so someone more experienced might correct me.\n\nIn Tank companies, these tanks are used:\n\n**Tier 6:** KV-1S (this might change after the nerf coming in 9.3), Hellcat, Cromwell and KV-2 \n\n**Tier 8 and Team battles:** IS-3, 110, AMX 50 100, AMX 13 90, Pershing, T32, maybe T69\n\nSame as with CW, I am not very experienced with TCs/TBs.\n\nAs for fun lines to grind, some of these might be subjective, but here we go:\n\n**IS-7:** Very noob-friendly line, all tanks are close-range brawlers with well-sloped armor, good mobility and punchy guns. All of them are very enjoyable and fun to play (except maybe IS-8)\n\n**IS-4:** Similar to IS-7 line, but trade mobility for better armor.\n\n**T110E5:** Tiers 5 and 6 have good frontal turret armor, decent front hull, good rapid-firing guns and very good mobility for heavies. Tiers 7 and 8 have stronk turret armor, decent mobility, bad hull front, terrible sides and rear, both have a bit underwhelming guns. Tiers 9 and 10 have fookin' awesome high-dpm guns good frontal armor and good mobility, both are very versatile tonks\n\n**E-100:** Up to tier 8, they are mostly support heavies with very accurate, high DPM, fast firing guns and not too awesome armor (although I liked to go frontline with Tiger II, with some angling, the armor is quite good). On tier 9 and 10, they are front line steelwalls with very good armor and high alpha guns. Watch out for artyfags.\n\n**T-62A/Obj.140:** Very good all-rounded mediums. Tiers 9 and 10 have stronk turrets and their guns are a bit lacking in terms of alpha, but have very high DPM. Some people don't like T-43/44, but I love both of them. \n\n**E-50M:** Can't say much about his one, I started grinding it short time ago and absolutely hated Panther. However, they are considered to be very good heavy-medium hybrids with lazor accuracy on tiers 9 and 10. *Some people* think E-50M is weak.\n\n**M48 Fatton:** Very good all-rounders up to tier 8. T20 is said to be very fun to play and it taught me how to play MTs. M26 is basically a lighter and faster version of T32. M46/48 are a victims of power creep, but M46 is getting buff in some of the upcoming patches (9.2?).\n\n**FV4202:** Fast mediums with pew-pew guns on tiers 6 and 7. On tiers 8 and up, they are a bit slower by mediums standarts, but have high pen and accuracy guns. My favourite medium line, though a lot of people might disagree. Tier 10 itself isn't very good but is getting buffed and eventually replaced.\n\n**BatChat 25t:** Light tanks with autoloaders, very fun to play, but not recommended to beginners, unless you know spotting mechanics and maps very well.\n\n**T57:** Mediums with aoutoloaders, T57 is considered to be the best tier 10 HT available. Similar warning as with BChat.\n\n**AMX 50B:** Autoloading heavies with no armor. Fun from tier 8 and up, but lower tiers will make you want to kill puppies. Not recommended to beginners blah blah blah....\n\n**Obj.268:** Very high alpha and pen guns on not-very-good platforms. Will troll both you and your enemies.\n\n**JgPz E-100** Fast, with very good, accurate guns. JP II is IMO the best and most fun to play TD in the game. JgPz IV is a bit underwhelming. JT is slow, has very good high-dpm gun, but is slow and no, it doesn't have armor, prepare some puppies. Jpz E-100 has very high alpha, but isn't very popular. You might want to stop at tier 8.\n\n**Honourable mention:** The Glorious KV-2. Stronkererest tank in the game. Mighty sovjet howitzer obliterates all fasists and kapitalist pigs.\n\nSo yeah, that's all from me. Other lines I haven't played/don't know enough about/are shit/are arty, so I didn't write about them. Once again, these might be very subjective, so do some more research. I would also recommend not to rush grinding high tiers, it's better to stay on lower tiers (5-7) for some time, get to know the game mechanics and try different playstyles and see what suits you. \n\nYou might also want to watch some streams/youtube videos, visit [rocketbrainsurgeon/wotlabs articles](http://wotlabs.net/articles/), [wotlabs forum](http://forum.wotlabs.net/), and [WoT wiki](http://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Main_Page).

{"body": "You made it personal by saying \"Wut??? This is the most wrong statement I have ever seen.\"  That's essentially saying... \"U Wot M8? That's literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You're an idiot\".  See, it doesn't sound very nice when it's put that way.  It's also not very nice the way you put it either.  That was a rather assholish way to start your post.\n\nI'll say it again. If this is TRULY the ***most wrong*** thing you've ***ever*** heard, then you must live in a pretty damn nice world. One that the rest of us here in reality don't seem to be able to enjoy.  In the real world, this certainly isn't the \"most wrong\" statement you've ever seen.  I guess you've never seen somebody deny the holocaust happened.  Or maybe you've never read of somebody saying the sun and solar system revolve around the earth.  Perhaps you never heard Cheney saying Saddam Hussein had Weapons of Mass Destruction that he was about to use?  I can think of many far \"more wronger\" statements then what offbrandz said.  Can you see why it's a dick move to say his statement is *more wrong* then these statements?  He's not denying the suffering and death of millions.  He's not telling lies which will cause an unnecessary war that will leads to the suffering and deaths of 100's of thousands.\n\nMoving on, none of what offbrandz said is blatantly false.  He never said he was speaking for all developers ever. He said he was speaking for himself, as a developer.  If these are truly his reasons (and they are real reasons, we didn't always have nifty tools like moment.js.  Determining a users location has never been easy or 100% accurate) then he is correct.  He's a developer, and those are his reasons.  He answered the question.  You may disagree with him and his methods or reasoning and that's fine, but it doesn't make you any more correct then he is.\n\nI really don't understand your **need** to be *right* or *more right*.  There is no one correct answer to this question.  And there absolutely is no reason to be rude, condescending, or act in the general douchebaggery that every single one of your comments have consisted of.  But I guess I'm still 'white-knighting', so what do I know? Maybe your the chosen one sent to save all us ignorant blebs from 'somebody on the internet who might be wrong'.\n\nIn the future, if you have additional information to add to a conversation, please, by all means, do so.

I think the sub-conscious voice that I talked about may be a consequence of having a hyper-active brain or a kind of hyper-awareness where the activity on hand such as small talk is not stimulating enough to keep a large-enough chunk of your brain busy, so the remainder power starts its own analysis.\n\nWho knows maybe the hyper-active brain makes you frustrated in those situations because it's just sitting there idle as you're chatting about mundane nonsense and it can't do anything about it, so it will focus on whatever is happening now, tearing it apart.\n\nIf the conversation or task is deep or stimulating you wont have sufficient remaining brain power to think about that stuff.\n\nAlso adrenaline-related activities are great because you will go into a holy-sheet-I-need-to-survive mode and forget everything else.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406724912", "subreddit": "intj", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is actually a deck I just built for my first one after finding little storm so adorable.\n\nSo, let me pull it out and do a run down of what is in mine and why I went with these options.\n\n**Grade 0**\n\n* Sanctuary of Light, Planet Lancer\n* 4 heal\n* 6 crit (Might be going 12 crit)\n* 6 draw\n\n**Grade 1**\n\n* 4 Sanctuary of Light, Little Storm\n* 4 Flash Shield, Iseult\n* 2 Toypugal\n* 2 Lien\n* 3 Marron\n\n**Grade 2** \n\n* 4 Sanctuary of light, determinator\n* 4 Gallatin\n* 3 Blaster Blade\n\n**Grade 3**\n\n* 4 Sanctuary of light, Planetal Dragon\n* 2 Sanctuary of light, Brightness Dragon\n* 1 White Dragon Knight, Pendragon\n\n\n\n**Breakdown**\n\nMy idea for this deck came down to consistency. I'm using as much as I can to pull out my ride chain which shouldn't ever be a problem because of the way little storm works. At the very least, you get a booster if you can't ride little storm on grade 1. Marron will just become a solid booster and powerful rear guard in the early game. Lien is just a fetch for more chances at hitting the ride chain. Toypugal is there to become a decent booster early game and then a 9k booster if you ever are unable to get your little storm out into a RG slot.\n\nDeterminator is a monster once your limit break hits on planetal(on top of being able to summon any sanctuary of light card to RG when you ride little storm). 12K Base+10k booster with little storm? U wot m8? Blaster blade's there for removal in case I can't clear stuff out with huge lanes and early pressure. Gallatin's a good beater with a booster like toypugal or little storm, he's in there.\n\nThe two sanctuary of light cards are just good. Limit break on planetal makes your lanes pretty large and the counterblast(2): search top 5 and call a sanctuary of light is just amazing. Brightness dragon should help to counter anything that locks your RG like little storm or whatever. Pendragon is in there as a last resort, if I can't get to Planetal by the time I'm at 4 damage this will come in handy to just pull him out and start making my lanes huge.\n\n\nTLDR; All the sanctuary of light stuff synergizes really well and I've had a ton of luck as far as consistency goes. It isn't the most competitive deck, but it's pretty fun as far as I'm concerned.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406833404", "subreddit": "cardfightvanguard", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
