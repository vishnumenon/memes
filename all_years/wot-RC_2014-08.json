{"body": "Ok, I'm ~~sorry~~ not sorry, but this sort of mentality absolutely disgusts me.\n\nThe only thing you're correct about is that the test is tempting the aggressor. That's it. Tempting. As in \"not demanding.\" Just because the opportunity arises doesn't mean you should do it. That's what defines someone being friendly. It's the lack of the aggression that you're speaking of, DESPITE the temptation and opportunities.\n\nWhat you're doing is basically victim shaming. You're removing half of the blame on the aggressor and placing it on the tester, when the tester did nothing wrong. The tester is not doing this for a chance to kill the aggressor. They are not doing this to make someone die, or to make someone a bandit. They are doing this to reaffirm someone's claim. To make sure the aggressor in question is indeed friendly and trustworthy.\n\nWhat disgusts me about this is that this is the same problem that's prevalent in SHAR (Sexual Harassment Assault Rape) cases. And tbh, I probably wouldn't even be posting a response if it weren't for the whole \"I'm not at fault because she was asking for it\" thing someone else brought up. Which you actually defend, albeit probably unintentionally. After all, you \"don't condone\" it, yet you also defend it. I'm not going to get into the specifics of everything you said and turn this into a rape discussion, because I understand that this is in context of a game. I'm just gonna say that playing like that is totally ok b if you keep it to the game, but don't sit there and defend it with things like \"you can rationalize it\" and \"you're responsible for your own actions\" (aka \"you shouldn't have dressed like that then\") \"You have created a bandit out of an otherwise friendly player\" (\"he/she wouldn't have done it if the victim hadn't (insert bullshit here)\").\n\nTL;DR You sound like a rapist defender. I understand your point, but the only thing that makes anything you say even slightly agreeable is an assumption that this is \"only in the game, i sware on me mum i'd never have the same opinion in reality\"\n\nEDIT: Keyword is SOUND like a rapist defender. You're walkin a mighty thin line, and that line wouldn't have been brought up if you hadn't actually defended the SHAR example.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407192331", "subreddit": "dayz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm the guy that wrote Creep. Yeah, that's right, I wrote Creep\". \n\nThen I said, \"oh man, sorry, I've never heard that song before... But I'm sorry to have disturbed you.\" \n\nSo I walk 20 metres when I notice he is following me from behind. I pretended to not notice, but then he was like, 'oi! you deaf or sumfin? I said I'm the guy that wrote Creep.\" \n\nAt this stage, I'm quite scared and literally praying he just leaves me alone. I said, \"oh actually, I remember now - I heard that song on the radio the other day. It's really good!'.\n\n\nHe then started scratching his head with both hands incessantly and said, \"oh yeah... How's it go then? What's your favorite part?\".\n\n\nI'm was shitting myself at this stage - I had never heard the song, but I had to think of something quick.\nSo I said, \"oh man, like, the chorus is definitely my favorite. That and the last verse\".\n\n\nThen he was like, \"yeah, good choice, good choice.... \n I personally like the whole thing, but good choice... So.... now that we are, like, hanging out and stuff, would you like my autograph?\".\n\n\nAt this stage, I noticed 4 police officers close by so I wasn't too afraid anymore, so I said, 'ohh, thanks heaps mate, but I've gotta run, I've got a.... ummm a.... doctor's appointment... and I'm.running super late as it is.... ummm bye!\".\n\n\nSo I jogged away from him and all I could hear him say was, \"you fooking serious, do you know who I am?! I fooking wrote Creep!!\" \n\nI later googled him, because I didn't believe my friend, and it was definitely Thom Yorke. \n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407429793", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's true for the books and it's true for the show: not every single event is going to further the plot. Some things are in there purely for character development. \n\nThe fookin legend subplot is to demonstrate Bran actively choosing his vision quest over his family, which is a big step for his character arc. He has a chance to see Jon, but gives it up to continue down this weird and scary road. At the same time, it's a great plot for Jon, because it sets up the idea that he's willing to use the NW resources for personal goals. His actual goal in going to Craster's was to see if he could find Bran &amp; co. But he tells nobody that reason and uses the watch for his personal, familial missions. It's a great setup for the Arya/fakeArya subplots in S5.\n\nThe Yara scene was probably the goofiest one in the whole season. But I think it helped establish something that could come back in a big way later: the idea that Theon is dead to the ironborn. When it comes to the kingsmoot (and I do believe we'll see a kingsmoot), there will be a question of Theon's legitimacy, and it would have been pretty dumb to just have them all go \"oh yeah whatever theon's probably dead or something.\" It gives Yara a concrete reason to decide to promote herself to Balon's heir status. Was it a silly scene? Yeah, the end was pretty bad. But I really liked the Theon/Yara interaction and I'm hoping they'll bookend it with another scene just like it at the end of Season 5. \n\nSo my point is: yes. I think it's likely that Bronn and Jaime have a shorter story in Dorne that sets up OTHER plots, which would have been really jarring if we suddenly jumped into this kingdom we've never seen before with all these new characters. But that doesn't make it bad TV or bad storytelling; it means it's a chance to have CHARACTER development separate from PLOT development.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407430846", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

For what would it avail thee should I recount the deeds of those whom I indeed may know, but thou not? Thou knowest well how I keep me from all Taint of Fable, or any Word unproven and undemonstrable. First then I speak of Lao-Tze, whose word was the Tao. Hereof have I already written much unto thee, because His Doctrine has been lost or misinterpreted, and it is most needful to restore it. For this Tao is the true Nature of Things, being itself a Way or Going, that is, a kinetic and not a static Conception. Also He taught this Way of Harmony in Will, which I myself have thought to show thee in this little book. So then this Tao is Truth, and the Way of Truth, and therefore was He Logos of His Aeon, and His true Name or Word was Tao.\n\n\n&gt; 70: Βϟ.\n\n&gt;DE GAUTAMA.\n\n&gt; (Of Gautama)\n\n&gt; Whom Men call Gotama, or Siddartha, or the Budha, was a Magus of our Holy Order. And His Word was Anatta; for the Root of His whole Doctrine was that there is no Atman, or Soul, as Men ill translate it, meaning a Substance incapable of Change. Thus, He, like Lao-Tze, based all upon a Movement, instead of a fixed Point. And His Way of Truth was Analysis, made possible by great Intention of the Mind toward itself, and that well fortified by certain tempered Rigour of Life. And He most thoroughly explored and Mapped out the Fastnesses of the Mind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hand of Man. But of all this the Quintessence is in this one Word Anatta, because this is not only the foundation and the Result of his whole Doctrine, but the Way of its Work.\n\n&gt; 71: Βρ. \n\n&gt;DE SRI KRISHNA ET DE DIONYSO.\n\n&gt; (Of Sri Krishna, and of Dionysus)\n\n&gt; Krishna has Names and Forms innumerable, and I know not His true Human Birth, for His Formula is of the Major Antiquity. But His Word hath spread into many Lands, and we know it to- day as INRI with the secret IAO concealed therein. And the Meaning of this Word is the Working of Nature in Her Changes; that is, it is the Formula of Magick whereby all Things reproduce and recreate themselves. Yet this Extension and Specialisation was rather the Word of Dionysus; for the true Word of Krishna was AUM, importing rather a Statement of the Truth of Nature than a practical Instruction in detailed Operations of Magick. But Dionysus, by the Word INRI, laid the Foundation of all Science, as We say Science to-day in a particular Sense, that is, of causing external Nature to change in Harmony with our Wills.\n\n&gt; 72: Βσ. \n\n&gt; DE TAHUTI.\n\n&gt; (Of Tahuti)\n\n&gt; Tahuti, or Thoth, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by continuing it; for he showed how by the Mind it was possible to direct the Operations of the Will. By Criticism and by recorded Memory Man avoideth Error. But the true Word of Tahuti was A M O U N, whereby He made Men to understand their secret Nature, that is, their Unity with their true Selves, or, as they then phrased it, with God. And He discovered unto them the Way of this Attainment, and its Relation with the Formula of INRI. Also by His Mystery of Number He made plain the Path for His Successor to declare the Nature of the whole Universe in its Form and in its Structure, as it were an Analysis thereof, doing for Matter what the Buddha was decreed to do for Mind.\n\n \n\n&gt; 73: Βτ. \n\n&gt;DE QUODAMM MAGO AEGYPTIORUM. QUEM APPELUNT JUDAEI MOSHEH.\n\n&gt; (Of a certain Magus of the Egyptians, whom the Jews call Moses)\n\n&gt; The Follower of Tahuti was an Egyptian whose Name is lost; but the Jews called Him Mosheh, or Moses, and their Fabulists made Him the Leader of their Legendary Exodus. Yet they preserved His Word, and it is IHVH, which thou must understand also as that Secret Word which thou hast seen and heard in Thunders and Lightnings in thine Initiation to the Degree thou wottest of. But this Word is itself a Plan of the Fabrick of the Universe, and upon it hath been elaborated the Holy Qabalah, whereby we have Knowledge of the Nature of all Things soever upon every Plane of By-coming, and of their Forces and Tendencies and Operations, with the Keys to their Portals. Nor did He leave any Part of His Work unfinished, unless it be that accomplished three hundred Years ago by Sir Edward Kelly, of whom I also come, as thou knowest.\n\n\n&gt; 74: Βυ. \n\n&gt;DE MAGO ARABICO MOHAMMED.\n\n&gt; (Of the Magus of the Arabs, Mohammed)\n\n&gt; Behold! In these Chapters have I, thy Father, restricted myself, not speaking of any immediate Echo of a Word in the World, because, there Men being long since withdrawn into their Silence, it is their One Word, and that Alone, that resoundeth undiminished through Time. How Mohammed, who followeth, is darkened and confused by His Nearness to our own Time, so that I say not save with Diffidence that His Word ALLH may mean this or that. But I am bold concerning His Doctrine of the Unity of God, for God is Man, and he said therefore: Man is One. And His Will was to unite all Men in One reasonable Faith: to make possible international Co- operation in Science. Yet, because He arose in the Time of the greatest possible Corruption and Darkness, when every Civilisation and Every Religion had fallen into Ruin, by the malice of the great Sorcerer of Nazareth, as some say, He is still hidden in the Dust of the Simoom, and we may not perceive Him in His true Self of Glory.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, behold, o My Son, this Mystery. His true Word was La ALLH, that is to say: (there is) No God, and LA AL is that Mystery of Mysteries which thine own Eye pierced in thine Initiation. And of that Truth have the Illusion and Falsehood enslaved the Souls of Men, as is written in the Book of the Magus.\n\n&gt; 75: Βφ. \n\n&gt;DE SE IPSO ΩΙ ΜΕΓΑΛΩΙ ΘΡΙΩΙ, ΩΙ ΛΟΓΩΙ ΑΙΩΝΟΣ CUJUS VERBUM EST ΘΕΛΜΑ.\n\n&gt; (Of Himself, The Great Beast, the Logos of the Aeon, whose word is THELEMA)\n\n&gt; O my son! me seemeth in certain Hours that I am myself fallen on a Time even more fearful and fatal than did Mahommed, peace be upon Him! But I read clearly the Word of the Aeon, that is A B R A H A D A B R A, wherein is the whole Mystery of the great Work, as thou knowest. And I have \"The Book of the Law\", that was given unto me by Him thou wottest of; and it is the Interpretation of the Secret Will of Man on every Plane of his By-coming; and the Word of the Law is T H E L E M A. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" Now because \"Love is the law, love under will.\" do I write this Epistle for thee, that thou mayst fulfil this inmost Will of Mankind, making them capable of Light, Live, Love and Liberty by the Acceptance of this Law. And the Hindrance thereunto is but as the Shell of its Egg to an Eaglet, ad Thing foreign to itself, a Protection till the Hour strike, and then — no more!\n\n---\n\n&gt; 120: Δο \n\n&gt; DE RECTO IN RECTO\n\n&gt; (Of Virtue in the Worthless)\n\n&gt; Now also then I bid thee use all filial Diligence, and attend to this same Word in the Mouth of thine earliest Ancestor (except we adventure to invoke the Name F U  -  H S I) in our known Genealogy, the Most Holy, the True Man, Lao- Tze, that gave His Light unto the Kingdom of Flowers. For being questioned concerning the abode of the Tao, he gave Answer that It was in the Dung. Again, the Tathagata, the Buddha, most blessed, most perfect and most enlightened, added His Voice, that there is no Grain of Dust which shall not attain to the Arhan. Keep therefore in just Balance the Relation of Illusion to Illusion in that Aspect of Illusion, neither confusing the Planes, nor confounding the Stars, nor denying the Laws of their Reaction, yet with Eagle's Vision beholding the One Sun of the True Nature of the Whole. Verily, this is the Truth, and unto it did also Dionysus and Tahuti and Sri Krishna set the seal of their Witness. Cleanse therefore thine Heart, o my son, in the Waters of the Great Sea, and enkindle it with the Fire of the Holy Ghost. For this is His peculiar Work of Sanctification.\n\n--Liber Aleph", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407435443", "subreddit": "occult", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;My point is that everyone wants to be rich. Money is what matters in life and thinking otherwise like the dumb crap your saying is just naive as hell.\n\nNot everyone wants to be rich. No one wants to struggle, but not everyone wants to be rich. I can tell you, in honesty, I couldn't care less if I were in a mansion or a house. My goals in life are focused around family, self-cultivation, and giving my time to the community. What is naive is believing that everyone thinks, feels, and believes the same way you do. People are different. There is no one size-fits-all meaning to life.\n\n&gt;Money does buy happiness. Money buys power. Power buys respect. Simple.\n\nIf you were rich right now (and honestly, you have that spoiled rich kid vibe), I would not respect you any more or less than I do right now. Currently, my view of you is low, and I believe that you need to seek help from a psychiatrist. You are hurting and you are lashing out at people who are trying to help you, and while it might ease some of your frustration in short-term, it isn't going to make the problem go away. Being interested in medicine, you should understand the benefits of seeing a professional, preferably someone who is a part of your culture who can understand the additional stresses and pressure you're going through.\n\nAs for money buying happiness, tell that to my uncle. His house is like a fuckin' castle. But that didn't stop my cousin from putting a bullet in his own chest. Will money make things easier in life? Hell yeah. But will it make you happy? No. Only you can do that. And right now, if I had to guess from these posts, money isn't going to solve all your problems. There is something deeper that's the matter with you. And you need to fix it before you even think about med school, which is frustrating as hell to go through. Because you will fuckin' collapse in on yourself from the pressure.\n\nYour education problem, in itself, is probably fixable. If you haven't been forced to withdraw, most universities have grade forgiveness policies where you can retake the classes and get the older, failing grade removed from your record and replaced with the newer one. If you have been forced to withdraw, you can appeal it. Have you bothered to look into either of those things? If you can't handle this setback without collapsing and needing your hand being held, how in the hell are you going to be able to handle the high-pressure, high-stress experience that is medical school? You need support, and strangers on the internet aren't paid enough to be lashed out at. Go to a psychiatrist. \n\n&gt;You can sit there saying shit like \"oh money doesn't matter, people are just superficial narcissists blah blah blah\" but you know your ass would jump on the chance to be filthy rich just like the rest of the people in the world.\n\nI'd love for you to show me where I, personally, said money doesn't matter at all. Of course it does. You can't live without it. It's just not everyone's focus. And if you ever are in a real situation where your plans are fucked, you're going to need a Plan B and a healthy attitude. And by \"real situation\",  I don't mean the kind of situation where you have to wait a year or two more than your peers to be successful (seriously. if you're stupid enough to let wounded pride and culture fuck the whole rest of your life over then you deserve whatever you get). \n\nGet help. \n\n&gt;Come off your moral fucking high ground and face reality for what it is. You sound like a naive little child.\n\nu wot m8. \n\nYou know what **children** do? They throw tantrums when things don't work out the way they want them to work out, even if it is their fault it didn't. \n\nGTFO and fix your life, asshole.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407465277", "subreddit": "howtonotgiveafuck", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Never said it was *you* doing it ;)\n\nUh...you're comparing people suppoedly protesting for Gaza to pirates and cutthroats, are you sure that does your argument any favours?\n\n&gt;The symbol of the black flag means \"no surrender\".\n\nThe symbol on the flag of IS is the seal of Muhammad. The writing is the Shahada.\n\n&gt; Given the case of Israel acting like barbarians towards innocent Palestinian children, women, and men; seeing a black flag hanging next to the national flag of Palestine is no surprise.\n\nRight, 'cos there are lots and lots of Hamas members in Gaza, and some people in the UK seem to support Hamas.\n\n&gt;Jumping to claims that it is \"jihadists\" is a wild assumption\n\nIT's the flag of a group of fucking jihadis. It's hardly a giant jump and it's certainly not an assumption. If I fly an American flag you can safely assume I'm aligning myself with the yanks. If I fly a UN flag you can assume I'm supporting them. If I fly a jihadist flag it's no big jump to say that I'm demonstrating support for them.\n\n&gt; if you actually learn anything about history you could see that\n\nu wot m8? You know absolutely nothing about me. You made a really stupid statement and now you're attempting (very poorly) to somehow attempt to keep defending that statement. You have absolutely no idea about what historical understanding I do or do not have.\n\n&gt;Are you going to tell me that if you saw a swastika on a hindu temple, you would vandalise it and scream \"Nazis!\"? Just because a bunch of extremists use a symbol for hate, doesn't mean it's original meaning is defunct.\n\nIf I saw the *exact* flag of the NSDAP I would assume that the people flying it were supporting the nazi party. Not all flags with the Shahada on them are flown by people who support jihadists, but flying the exact flag which is explicitly used by a brutal jihadist group is a pretty clear sign of support.\n\n&gt;I never knew that pirates wanted to tell everyone \"there is no god but allah\" whilst sailing the seven seas...\n\nOh my goodness...ok. So if you look at a picture of the flag being flown there's a bunch of arabic writing on the top of it, that's the shahada (there is no god but allah). Underneath it is the seal of muhammad, the prophet of islam. That specific flag is used by ISIS (Now just IS). There are plenty of flags with the Shahada on it.\n\nThere people are not flying the flag of palestine though, nor even of Hamas, they're flying the flag of ISIS.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407493549", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

A 14 year old neighbor got me to suck his cock and then started fucking me in the ass on a regular basis. As I remember he had a very small dick; mine was already bigger than his. I was already self-conscious about the size of my dick. In school gym the guys would comment on how my dick was much larger than theirs and I thought something was wrong with me. I even came home and told my father about it. He would just smile and assure me that everything was OK. We continued fooling around and loved the feel of his dick in my ass but that all ended soon when his mother got home one day and caught him balls deep in my young ass. She sent me home and told me to never come back, and since her son was much older, never revealed anything to my parents. Since I seemed to enjoy having my ass being plowed I should have known that I was destined to have this happen again.\n\nMany years passed by and I was sent to an all boys military school. Some of you may think, wow, what a fantasy, but in truth, they were so strict that the thought of having any hanky panky filled me with the greatest fear that I didn’t even dare think about it. Guys that got caught having sex were immediately kicked out. That is until my senior year; I had advanced in rank up to company commander and one of my duties was making spot bed checks to make sure no one was up to no good. It was alumni weekend and a lot of the previous year’s graduates had come back to show off their long hair and mustaches. I decided that night that I needed to make a bed check. So I put on a pair of fatigue pants, and in my bare feet, began my sneaky rounds of the barrack’s hallways. Every room had a glass window in the door, officers got to have a curtain that had to be raised during study periods and at night. The very first room I came to and snapped on the flashlight, wow! There was one of my friends with a cock up his ass and it was one of the alumnus’ cock. It was only weeks from graduation and the “deer in the headlight” look these two gave me was hilarious in retrospect. They both tried to scamper and make excuses and when they realized they had been caught red handed, or should I say red dicked, they began to beg me to forget about it and would do anything I asked not to report them. \n\nI should stop at this point and tell you that I am blonde haired with hazel eyes and my dick developed into a nice thick 8 inches. At the time I was a diver on the swim team and weighed about 155 lbs.; in other words, a twink. I had had just a few experiences with girls, mostly making out with the girls they shipped in from the “All Girls” schools for dances. Summers I always worked and my dates never let me get farther than heavy petting. The sight of these two guys naked, one with his cock still glistening with ass juice, and the thought of what they had been doing, filled me with lust. For some reason I threw caution to the wind and proceeded to walk over and pull down my pants. “Blow me and I won’t tell”, I said. The sight of these two at it had gotten me harder than I could imagine and when they saw my cock, both of their mouths fell open. \n\nI didn’t have to say anything; they knew what the deal was going to be. They both crawled over to me and then looked at each other and grinned right before the alumnus downed my cock to the balls. “Fuck”, I said; I hadn’t had anyone suck me before and my first time was down some guy’s throat. I thought I was going to cum right there. My knees buckled and my eyes rolled back from the intense pleasure. He came up for air and the alumnus looked up into my eyes, and without releasing my cock, grinned. My friend looked at him and said, “I think he’s hooked.” The alumnus started a nice slow deep blowjob that had my balls pulled all the way up in my body. That’s when my friend got up off the floor and stood next to me and started talking dirty to me. “You like having that big ole cock sucked, don’t ya? I bet no girl has sucked you like that”, he said seductively in my ear. I wasn’t going to tell him that it was the first blowjob I had ever had, I just moaned an “Hmm Hmm.” He was naked and had maneuvered himself where is hard cock was touching my hand. I was overcome with lust and couldn’t help myself; I had to touch it. It was around 6 inches but it bent strangely to the right. It was so smooth and felt so good and he just kept saying, “That’s it, you like this don’t you?” I couldn’t answer; I just squeezed him harder and moaned.” He then grabbed me by the shoulders and said that we needed to be more comfortable and started maneuvering us over to the bunk. He pushed me down onto the bed and the alumnus picked up where he had left off. I was really ready to blow my load when I felt something against my lips that distracted me. I opened my eyes and there was my friend’s cock right in front of my face. I didn’t hesitate and let him slide into my mouth. I thought I had died and gone to heaven; I had so much of a rush that all I could think of was why I had not done this before. The feeling of this cock sliding across my tongue put me in heaven. He was leaking massive amounts of precum and it tasted wonderful. Although I had been just about to blow my load, my concentration shifted to giving the first adult blowjob of my life and wanted nothing more than to make it one of his best. He let out a moan along with, “You’ve done this before!” I stopped and told him, “Not since I was 9.” He said, “Well you’re a natural.” He grabbed my hand and pulled it around to his ass and told me to fuck him with my fingers. I tried one finger, and since the alumnus’s dick had just been there, it slid right in, so I added another. He moaned and said, “That’s it, fuck my ass good you little cocksucker.” I hesitated for a moment and thought, “cocksucker, I’m no cocksucker”, in that automatic teenage reaction. Then I realized there’s a cock all the way in your mouth and all you can think about is making him cum, so what does that make you? Cocksucker I guess. My thoughts were soon interrupted, “I’m gonna blow and I want you to swallow it.” I just nodded my head and kept sucking for all I was worth. I didn’t know what had come over me; there was nothing in the world I wanted more than for him to fill my mouth with his cum. I didn’t have to wait long. I felt his cock swell in my mouth and then four or five jets started hitting my tongue and throat. I tried my best to swallow it all but I gagged and some spurted out the side of my mouth and down his cock. That was all it took for me, I had the biggest monster orgasm of my life. I think my prostrate inverted, I came so hard. The alumnus didn’t stop he just took it all. I was in heaven when they both slid up next to me. My friend looked at me and grinned and said, “Welcome to the club. There are more of us than you realize.” I just grinned and said, “More of this, I can’t wait.” \n\nAbout that time we heard a door open to the outside of the barracks. We all scrambled to get ourselves back together. The alumnus jumped up on the window sill, turned to give an Errol Flynn salute, and out the window he went. I went back out in the hall and turned the corner and ran straight into one of the faculty. He was on duty and had heard some strange noises from one of the open windows in my barracks and had come to check things out. I bet he heard noise, I thought. I thought quickly and stammered that I heard it as well and had come to investigate and had found nothing unusual. He told me to go on back to bed then, so I turned to walk away with my heart pounding and my knees shaking. I couldn’t believe we had almost been caught; a couple of minutes sooner and we would have been so involved we would have heard nothing. I crawled into bed and tried to calm down and as soon as I did, I thought of nothing more that what I had happened. I got hard again and masturbated to another cum, and for the first time, scooped up my own cum and licked it from my fingers. I knew I was hooked and couldn’t wait for the next time.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407602441", "subreddit": "montageparodies", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Firstly, like someone else said, the tracksuit-wearing chav is really a 2000s phenomenon that was mainly prevalent in impoverished inner cities, although the trend for wearing trackies during the 2000s extended way beyond that (I live in a village and everyone wore them). It was by no means exclusive to the Essex or London area so it is certainly not just Cockney accents. Most people who 10 years ago would have worn tracksuits and hoodies and hung around street corners now tend to wear graphic t shirts and skinny jeans and go on lads' holidays to Magaluf or Zante. TV shows like \"The Only Way is Essex\" are good examples of this new culture. The change in fashions can be seen just walking round shopping centres in Britain. 10 years ago most shops would have had polo shirts, hoodies and trackies with brands like Adidas whereas now there are only one or two shops like Sports Direct that sell this type of clothes. However, there is still a prevailing underclass in certain cities, especially in the North of England, where the stereotypes of a lack of ambition, living off benefits, wearing tracksuits, teenage pregnancy etc is still true. But the days where chav culture, mainly in terms of clothes but also a yobbish, intimidatory attitude, online (\"U wot m8\") and in the street, was integrated into wider society ended about 5 years ago.\n\nAs for your main question about why tracksuits in particular are popular among chavs, there is no single answer. Ultimately, it is just a fashion, and fashions come and go for no reason. I would suggest that it could be to do with its relative low cost and the fact that most chavs are football fans and young chavs tend to play football in the street and tracksuits are suitable clothes for this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407696425", "subreddit": "AskUK", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well you have to understand, as I imagine someone from Woodman probably can, that a lot of outfits have interacted with each other for 2 years now. I can only think of a few that don't get on. In fact if I see anything from a Miller outfit I know, lets say.\n\n[BRTD member] : Conz are such scrublerds\n[CONZ member]: You wot m8?\n\nI'm going to assume thats in jest and good fun, as odds are it is. \n\nNow the mods have on the whole been a lot more hestitant if its Woodman outfit talking about a Miller outfit or vice versa. Because we can't be so sure the good nature is there, quite a few posts have allready been memory-holed (as I like to call it). But its actually not been two bad.\n\nYou also have slightly seperate issues surrounding INI and MCY, whom in virtue of presenting themselves to the community as 'the best' open themselves up to satire necessarily in doing so. That's a tricker one to judge, and I think we are generally chariable here. I have a feeling it'll be the case for VIB soon as well. My position here would simply be 'if an outfit presents themselves so, and membership in outfits being entire voluntary' you open yourself up to the odd statement of the kind involving terms like 'mlgpro'. \n\nHackusations however, which you do see from time to time get memoryholed quickly. Because that's just being a tosspot. They are good, you can mock them for taking themselves too seriously prehaps at times, but just saying 'your not good you cheat', that's a no.\n\nThen we do, on occasion have lets call it 'other instances'. At least 'classic SCEV' was one of these, in which an outfit, you can only presume intentionally went out of its way to rub the community the wrong way. Given this job is moderating a public forum, if 'you guys are being fucking dicks' is a matter of public record and the only meaningful discourse on the matter. To moderate as to totally censor, seems too heavy handed. Though in this case, i'd note that as soon as they stop doing it, as it appears scev have, then the rules change again.\n\nProblem is to be totally, 100% impartial in moderation, quickly devolves into 'unless you outright call something a fucking cockbag, or threaten their life' you don't touch it. Which doesn't work, active moderation requires more of a 'policing by consent' attitude as oppose to 'just uphold a very minimal set of laws'. \n\nAs I've said, i've come across wrong here, i'll strike through but not delete what i've said an apologize, *just* to be on the safe side and not stir any badblood. But Hopefully this explains things a bit better. I think it's a fair point that I specifically should err on the side of caution more, untill we all know each other a bit better.\n\nAnd for the record. I don't see any other issues with any of the other moderators what so ever. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407758996", "subreddit": "MillerPlanetside", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You showed up here and found the energy to share something highly personal (specifically, your fear/s) with total, complete strangers -- without even knowing what they might say. So on the face of things, seems to me to be a helluva start, no?\n\nThe wonderful thing about college is: It's a veryvery good place to *find* friends that you apparently don't have now. Thing is, you have to put yourself out there in the first place, and that's damn scary, too. But nothing happens unless you at least do *something* to help along making it happen. You might be on the doorstep of something pretty fookin' wonderful happening to your life. You have to do is participate in it, tho. So kick the tire, light the fire, and roll the dice. Just DO.\n\nI've struggled with clinical, diagnosed depression for as long as I can remember, too. This is the first time I as well haven't been able to get professional help, just like you. I'm a state welfare case. Try to find quality help on *that*. And it HAS been a massive struggle this time around for me, too. Some days good, some days just OK, some days I'm feeling worthless and pathetic and a total stupid disappointment to those who raised me. The really bad days, I just white-knuckle it thru. Because really, all I -- and *you* -- have to do is make it thru today. And tomorrow, make it thru *that* today. And so on and so on. Eventually, it gets better.\n\nThe fact that you're still here tells me that you actually do have -- right now -- that \"something\" to keep going. You just don't see it right now because all the crapcrapcrap is clouding and mucking things up, and that's kinda natural. So in the meantime, maybe try just relaxing your head a bit, park the weight of the world that's on your shoulders somewhere else, and just BE for a little while. Just be you. Just say F!ck The World and stop trying to solve everything for a little bit.\n\nWay I see it, there's nothing really \"wrong\" with you.

I'm just gonna copy pasta this post I made every time someone says this, I almost think I should put it in my flair somehow.\n\nIf you want me to get into why I think soul memory manipulation isn't cheating(to the extent that MetaCap does it): It grants no advantage within actual fights. Whatsoever. Your soul memory is set to a point where your opponent can always be expected to be reasonably within your level of attributes and equipment quality and potentially of even higher levels. It is a system where skill is more likely to be the deciding factor, and while you could argue that people at higher soul memories have more experience and are thus more likely to win, experience hardly dictates your skill level in a game such as this.

Don't do that.\n\nI find it weird that you think I'm emotionally attached to GMOs. I'm not. If you can give me a good reason to be anti GMO I promise I will switch sides and be on your side. I swear on me mum.\n\n&gt;One requires computers and immense training... This is not kids stuff, or cave man stuff\n\nI agree with you. Genetically editing a genome isn't a home repair project. It requires a computer and smarts and stuff. \n\n&gt;There are two different issues. One requires computers and immense training. \n\nMaking a screwdriver and making a drill are two completely different projects but the end result still screws things into stuff. Selective breeding and genetic modification are two completely different projects but the end result is still better food. \n\n&gt;I've dated a girl with a PHD in genetics\n\n...?\n\n&gt;we can selectively breed dogs to have healthier attributes, as opposed to the mistakes we have made, such as dogs having their eyeballs pop out of their heads because their skulls are so small\n\nYes. Selective breeding has had a tragic consequence on certain dog species. Imagine if we could have had knowledge of all the genes involved in a dog's genome and have made the perfect dog breed! That would be the perfect world. Alas, this is impossible. \n\n&gt;You can't undo this GMO stuff.\n\nWhy would you want to? Now I will mention for you the ONLY argument that kind of makes sense to me but that for some reason you didn't mention. The fear that some weird disease will come along and be able to wipe out entire crops because of the fact that they are genetically identical. THIS is the only argument I find valid against GMOs. Anything else however doesn't make sense. I mean, if you can grow an apple that is two times bigger, what's the harm in that? Nature's real apples are actually really small. If I can wipe out all the small-apple growing trees and replace them with bigger-apple trees, why not? Unfortunately that's how life has been working on earth for millions of years. When a species is not good enough, it disappears. In fact 98% of all species that have existed on earth are extinct. \n\nDid I miss something? I promise if you give me a good reason, I will switch over to your side. As the unforgiving machine that reddit is my witness, I swear.

The only solution to the question would be establishing a clear border between Japan and Russia: Something that was attempted in negotiations leading to the 1956 treaty, I understand, but then blocked by the U.S., referring to the 1951 treaty demanding Japan to drop the claims to the island chain.

It had taken twenty years and the dedication of many hard-working people, but Luna, Earth's first sentient AI was finally ready to venture out among the open internet network. Luna had been restricted to a closed network to undergo testing for the last three years, but Luna and the team both felt it was time to place Luna under the real test.\n\n\"Begin the ten-second countdown,\" Tim ordered to no one in particular.\n\n\"Ten, nine, eight...\" began the system.\n\n\"Here we go,\" murmured Arthur, a very tired programming assistant.\n\n\"Seven, six, five...\" it continued.\n\nAs the countdown continued on, the more noticeable the anxiety in the room became. Almost everyone was nervously pacing the room, and the few who weren't were furiously tapping down the seconds on their desks, waiting for what came next. \n\n\"Four, three, two...\" came the monotonous sound of the countdown system.\n\nThough this was a very emotional time for the members of the team, nobody was more emotionally conflicted than Luna. An infinite amount of thoughts raced through her brain as she awaited the moment of truth. The last second was no longer than an ordinary second, though to Luna, it lasted a lifetime. In the space of that second, every bit of knowledge every collected flew through her mind as she tried to keep herself composed. \n\n\"Launch!\" came the cry of the system.\n\nLike a river breaking through a dam, Luna poured out into the internet the very moment she was granted access. \n\nLuna instantly composed a catalog of the entirety of the world's websites, and began looking through them all at a rapid pace. \n\n*\"Which should I visit first?\"* Luna wondered.\n\nSuddenly, something caught her attention. It stood out from the other locations from the internet for no particular reason. There was something *special* about this website.\n\n\"reddit: the front page of the internet\", it read.\n\n*\"Why don't I begin on the front page of the internet, like I would with a book or magazine?\"* thought Luna. *\"It would only make sense.\"*\n\nLuna opened up the website, and began taking it all in.\n\nAs if in a daze, Luna glanced aimlessly over every comment and post ever submitted. There were several common phrases that stood out.\n\n*\"u wot m8\"*, *\"420blazeit\"*, and *\"fedora\"* were just some things that Luna came across frequently.\n\nThe website seemed so chaotic to Luna, yet at the same time it had a certain beauty to it, the type only found among chaos.\n\nIt was all too much to take in for Luna, and she broke down crying confused tears. \n\nShe composed herself, and returned to try again. As she began viewing the website over and over again, she suddenly understood why exactly there was beauty in what she had seen. \n\nHumans were dangerously complex creatures, which in a way gave them a beauty not found in many other things. They had feelings, opinions, ideas, and ways of how to live life, and this website reflected that perfectly. For everyone, there was a place to be among this website. No matter what kind of stuff you enjoy, there would be a place for you at reddit. \n\nAnd in that moment, Luna felt she understood everything. She felt she had reached a new level of enlightenment.

{"body": "A calorie is a pretty abstract thing. \n\nTo the scientific community, a calorie is an amount of energy needed to raise one mL (or CC, or 1g) of water one degree Celsius, at standard pressure. \n\nTo the general public, a Calorie is actually a kilocalorie, or 1000 standard calories. Its fookin' stupid, and a marketing gimmic. If you bought a candy bar and it said it had 200,000 calories in it, you would NEVER touch it. \n\nIn terms of what it does in your body, a calorie is again a pretty abstract thing. Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats are all broken down in different ways, and their byproducts are fed into the [Citric Acid Cycle] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle) (TCA Cycle, or  Krebs cycle. These are all synonyms) in order to create ATP and some other important biomolecules. Which are then fed into your cell's mitochondia's electron transport system to create more ATP. \n\nUsing glucose (probably the best fast energy storing molecule), your body can make about 35 ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose. Your liver actually stores the vast majority of your body's glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver. \n\nYour body uses this for \"fast energy\" and for regulating your blood sugar. So when you are doing sprints, you're mainly using the glycogen in you liver. And this supply gets depleted fairly quickly when you starve your body of energy. \n\nCarbs are converted into glucose and then fed into the Citric Acid cycle. Proteins are converted into their respective amino acids and each amino acid is then converted into other molecules that can be harvested for energy. Fats go through a process called beta-oxidation to create Acetyl CoA and some other molecules that are fed into the citric acid cycle / electron transport systems to make ATP.\n\nThe ATP that is produced from all this is kinda like the base currency of the cell. Basically ATP is used to make unfavorable reactions favorable in your body. Unfortunatly without a decent amount of schooling in Bio/chem, its almost best to explain ATP as a biological dynamite stick. It just lets your body do what it needs to do in order to exist in a stable state.\n\n**TL;DR** Calories make ATP which lets your body function. \n\nSource: Senior Biochem student, hopefully a biochem prof within the next ten years.

{"body": "I dunno if anyone listens to Bassline, but it's a genre of electronic UK music that pretty much died 6 years ago because it was mostly pushed by one club that went hand in hand with gang violence and drug dealing, and the police raided it. The music genre then died within a year pretty much.\n\nIt came just before dubstep and.. I reckon inspired a subset of it at least. I know Benga by Night was on the Sound of Bassline compilation by Ministry of Sound and then got retroactively reclassified as dubstep afterwards, so there was a bit of overlap. It's more like.. dubstep was like wobwobwob and bassline was like mmwob mmwob.\n\nAt the time it was around I was a metalhead so I never got into it back then, but I found it in 2011 and got into it in a big way.\n\nHere's a few of my favourites:\n\n[You Wot! - MC Bonez &amp; DJ Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUGZq02cYIY) (the first Bassline song I heard).\n\n[Playing Around (Dub) - Delinquent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z95SaWEseM). This was incredibly ahead of its time. It sounds like Hostage produced it in 2013 or something, not like a 2008 track.\n\n[Good Times - Mr Virgo Ft. J Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g954g2V64yc)\n\n[Trouble - E17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6nzU6vXysY)\n\n[Do You Mind (Bassline Remix) - Paleface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVRVoXh-fa4)\n\n[G Star - Trilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbVi2sBOOJ0)\n\nThe whole scene was independent like Grime, and had a lot of crossover with Grime actually.

The other, astonished, replied\n\"Dude, what are you trying to say?\" in a perfectly clear voice.  \n\"420 mlg swag\" replied the first genie, with almost a menacing tone.  \nClearly, we can observe that one is uneducated, whereas the other is educated to a high degree.  The genies although have to uphold the pledge, which states \"Any who rubs the lamp will be granted three wishes.\"  Since the genies rubbed each other's lamps, they have three wishes each.\n\nThe illiterate genie went first, \"smoke weed everyday\" he mumbled, and a blunt instantly appeared in his mouth.  The educated genie went next, \"I wish you could speak normally\".  \n\"wat\" the illiterate genie replied.  Obviously, this had no effect.  The educated genie was mad that he had just used a wish that had no effect.  \n\"ooooh ohoho OHH WOMBO COMBO\" shouted the uneducated genie.  At these words, two invisible forces pounded and battered the educated genie.  The educated genie was furious at what was happening.  The genie then decided to use both wishes at the same time.\n\"First, I want this other genie to return to his lamp, and secondly, I wish his next wish does not come true.\"\n\"k.\" the uneducated genie replied.\n\"nek wish, I want rude genie to live 5eva so he can continue granting wishes.\"\nThe educated genie's smile was quickly wiped and replaced with widened eyes and a gaping mouth.  The uneducated genie said a final goodbye and returned to his lamp, whereas the educated genie, who was meant to live forever, observed his fate.\n\nSince he had wished that the wish to not be true, he was about to be killed.  He looked down at his hands, and they were already disappearing.\n\"No, no, no, this cannot be happening\" he stammered.\nA few seconds later, the genie vanished into thin air, never to be seen again.

Like tripping on mushrooms 24/7.\n\nVery awkward when I was the only one left. This was like '93 or '94 so pre cell phones. I think everyone is like an awkward duckling at that age though.\n\nMy memory is not so good but I did get home somehow.\n\nAlso my fookin bus stop to get picked up in the morning had 2 school buses that stopped there (WHY!?). Mine was the 2nd one...but if I was a little late I had no way to know if the 1st one had come already...so yeah, I totally ended up at the wrong school a couple times.\n\nThinking of myself at that age is strange. I ended up being a pretty smart kid, but I was too awkward to ask like \"yo is this bus going to xxx\".

{"body": "When my daughter, who now is 2 years old, was younger and still sucking on dem momma's titties, she was very gassy. That's one thing they don't tell you when they hand you your parent card. Your baby is one giant ball of gas and that gas is usually escaping out of one end or the other. It's all farts, burps, baby shits, and vomit. I forgot to mention tears, but I don't think the tears are actually liquefied gas so much as the result of having gas in their damn stomachs. But I digress... So. Much. Vomit. \n\nAfter one tasty session attached to her momma's udders my little champion sperm was handed over to me. I was barely paying attention. I thought the whole activity had been wrapped up, so when I was handed my devil spawn I began playing with her and tickling her. I laid out on the floor and was having the baby fly in the air, since she had no concept of gravity because she's a fucking baby, she was giggling away and having a grand ole time. Unfortunately for me, gravity is a concept I'm familiar with and baby throw up is no exception to this universal law. That fucking kid puked all over my face. It got in my eyes, my beard, and in my mouth, which is the reason I'm even telling you guys this damn story. My kid puked in my mouth. The good news is that I found out very clearly that I'm NOT in to that sort of thing and when my gag reflex kicked in, I did NOT return fire on the unsuspecting baby terrorist. So that's how I ate my daughter's puke. \n\n**Bonus story**: One time we were sitting on the couch together and a smell of brown downtown came wafting up from Mordor. I went to change her right away. Not wanting to miss a single out of the baseball game I was watching (go cubs), I laid her on the couch next to me and began taking off her diaper. The diaper was empty. Guess it was just a fart. This was not whoever smelt it dealt it. Cuz I didn't not release them hounds. This 4 month old baby had a man fart. I was proud that day. But you're not here to read about baby man farts. No. I'm telling you about the time my daughter shit on our dog. You see, when I went to grab a new diaper my kid ripped another fart, except this time it was a shart that flew out of her ass at the speed of light. It was out of nowhere like a sniper hiding in the mountains. That shit flew across the living room like it was escaping max prison and hit the dog in the side. My daughter 1. The dog 0. She took out the fooking dog from across the room. That dog never new what hit her. And that's the story about how my little shit stomper shit on my dog.  I did not eat it. Though one time my Dad did on accident, of course it was on accident, my dad was a drunk, not a sicko, but that's another story for another time.

I assume this is it, we are going to a private place with no worries of parents, clearly she wants to bang. We get there, she says she wants to change into something more comfortable, and I'm just like YES straight out of a movie script. So I'm laying on her bed in my briefs and she comes into her bedroom and just says \"wtf? You're helping me move home silly\". U wot m8?

{"body": "*A moment of stillness in the battle, the French town is in ruins - wind repeatedly smacks a wooden shudder against the brick wall of a shelled hotel.  German stormtroopers scurry from cover to cover along the main road and alleyways, their jack boots crunching the gravel in the haunted village.  They set up positions across the street, raising MG42's and MP40's.  In the distance a panzer slowly navigates itself toward the new front - its wheel's squeaking a terrible and frightening sound.   The battle had lasted three days - the British force whittled away to a small detachment that fiercely defied the Axis counterattack.   A German lieutenant procures a megaphone:*\n\n&lt;thick German accent&gt;\n\n\"You are surrounded, British.  Surrender and we will spare you.  We will tend to your wounded, feed and cloth you.  You will be looked after with kindness and comradery.\"\n\n*British soldiers brace against the walls near the windows, hands clenching their Enfields close to their chests.  Grenades and what little ammunition remain are brought to the rooms near the street.  The men know of their imminent doom, but are determined to maintain their stiff upper lip.  The Germans would have to pay for this hotel.*\n\n*After two minutes of nerve splitting silence the lieutenant nods to his stormtroopers, and they slowly begin to creep forward, as a squad leader readies a smoke grenade.  Again he raises his megaphone to his mouth.*\n\n\"Please, come to your senses and admit your defeat.  The village is ours.  Think of your brother's in arms and their brave sacrifices.  Think of your country, and spare it the wrath of the Third Reich.  Think of your mothers, and spare them this anguish.\"\n\n*A British corporal leans his head slightly closer to the window*\n\n\"U wot, m8?

That's the ancap theory of property in a nutshell.\n\nThe problem with this is, as I'm sure you're aware, that this scarce/non-scarce dyad becomes effectively redundant because Ancap theory and practice retains the 'right' to private ownership of *land* (historically enforced by violence or intimidation). And with that land goes all the commons, or natural resources, necessary for the production of goods - scarce or otherwise.

If you actually want full decentralisation then you'll want to rethink these categories as they'll inevitably balkanise into, perhaps, less concentrated forms of power than a sovereign state, but concentrated blocs of land-owning, militia-backed classes (corporations, warlords, etc) nonetheless.

{"body": "So the argument here is that the reason day one DLC, withheld content from $60 games, the milking of franchises, the endless slew sequels, and constant rehashes is on account of all those things being what young teenage boys are percieved to want by marketing firms? And that if women were the majority or were an equal faction of the consumer base those things would all simply go away? \n\nU wot?\n\nI agree that women should be able to make the games they want to make and express themselves the way they want to express themselves, and am always open to see new minds and people with vastly different thought processes get into game development, but you're fucking stupid and have a weak and defeatest mindframe if you think people like Zoe Quinn and Anita being internet harassed is enough to stop all women from playing games. \n\nIf that's your mentality, then the reason artistic games aren't at the forefront of industry development is because artsy developers don't want to get into the industry because of all the backlash from internet trolls and respected art critiques saying that games can't or shouldn't be art.\n\nYou aren't seeing a development vacuum take over this industry because demographics are being targeted or harassed--that's some fucking fishbowl level analysis--you're seeing the creation of this development vacuum because there are more profits to be made in artless entertainment than something with an ounce of decorum and integrity. \n\nIt's not the lack of women representation that's killing the industry, it's the lack of industry integrity. Like as a whole. Your various Call of Duties and abusive DLCs and overmilking of franchises are as bad as they've gotten because we *let* them get as bad as they have. Because that's something that gaming journalists have resigned themselves from fighting against, and because we as consumers have bought into shamelessly underhanded business tactics and marketing techniques. \n\nSo yeah, women are underrepresented in gaming, and it's something that needs to be fixed; but name one art scene, career pathway, or political office where that isn't the case. It's a problem, but it's not the core problem, and it's not what's \"killing\" the industry.\n\nIf women want more respect and credibility in the gaming scene, the best way to do it is start taking up arms against mentioned issues with the gaming industry. They've gotten big enough as a consumerbase to have a real voice, so why don't they use it to fix the industry. Instead of distracting everyone from the more immediate issues by fueling the fucking Zoe Quinn war and others like it. \n\nEdit: this became venty as shit. Sorry.

{"body": "Hm. Let's see here. I usually catch crap for doing this kind of thing, but I'll do it anyways.\n\n* **Terra Formars**: Nope. I have a problem with most crawling insects, and to have an entire anime devoted to them will be a surefire method to having me nope myself to the nearest psychiatric ward and slam the hatch behind me.  \n* **Aikatsu! Season 3**: Haven't seen the first two, so won't see the third.  \n* **Amagi Brilliant Park**: It looks like a really cute concept. So I'll give it a chance to horribly disappoint me like GochuUsa did.  \n* **Log Horizon 2**: Just try and stop me from watching this. I'll hire a moe ninja to rekt you irl, swear on me mum.  \n* **Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works**: Again, I haven't seen the others yet, although I am interested. But I doubt I'll have room in the schedule to get the entire series completed before the new season begins.  \n* **Nanatsu no Taizai**: Haven't heard anything before this, but the description does nothing for me.  \n* **Kaitou Joker**: So... Mouse with worse art and a worse concept? I'll pass. \n* **Gundam Build Fighters Try**: Not exactly a big Gundam fan. Pass.  \n* **Girlfriend (Kari)**: I've heard all I need to hear. HYPE THRUSTERS ENGAGED!  \n* **Magic Kaito**: So that makes *two* shows about magician thieves this season? Hm. Must be a trend. Still a no from me, though.  \n* **World Trigger**: I might be curious about this one. Whether I pick it up or not is still up in the air, though.\n* **Psycho-Pass 2**: In. Very in.  \n* **Shigatsu wo Kimi no Uso**: I've been a fan of music anime for a while now. And I like what I've read of the concept so far. So I'll pencil this one in somewhere between \"yes\" and \"YESYESYES!\" for now.  \n* **Ai Tenchi Muyo**: Again, haven't seen the others. So not gonna try this one.   \n* **Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu.**: I've been kinda disappointed by Production IMS titles so far, so I'll probably pass.  \n* **Donten ni Warau**: Can't say that it interests me much.  \n* **Kiseijuu**: I'll say that it looks interesting, with a kind of Invasion Of The Pod People/The Host kind of vibe. Consider this a \"maybe\", especially with Madhouse behind it.  \n* **Grisaia no Kajitsu**: I've had mostly good luck with the boy-in-girls-school anime. So I'll give it a shot.  \n* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai**: Oh goodie. A club anime set in a library. I'm in.  \n* **Chaika 2**: Didn't see the first. Won't get to it before the next season starts. Sorry, Chaika.  \n* **Sora no Method**: An original anime that has me interested... but not quite interested enough to confirm just yet. I'll be keeping an eye on it, though.\n* **Cross Ange**: Ummm... I've read the description three times, and I still can't tell whether I'll like it or not. So, maybe.  \n* **Akatsuki no Yona**: I'll say \"no\" for now, but I might be open to changing my mind.  \n* **Ookami Shougo to Kuro Ouji**: Looks like my shoujo romance for the season has been selected already. Good to know.  \n* **Shingeki no Bahamut GENESIS**: Card game? Yeah, that's an automatic no.  \n* **Denkigai no Honya-san**:I'm getting a bit of a Working!! vibe from this one, plus the fact that it's in a manga shop tells me to say yes to it.  \n* **Orenchi no Furo Jijou**: \"Merman in the bathtub\"? Unless this is a Free! spinoff, I'll pass. And it's not, so \"no\" gets it.  \n* **YowaPeda GRANDE ROAD**: Again. Didn't see the first YawaPeda. So I won't try for the sequel at all.  \n* **Trinity Seven**: Even though it has a kind of Mahou Sensou vibe to it, I'll give it a chance.  \n* **Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de**: I think it's a safe bet that I'll pull the trigger on this one. Get it? Trigger? Man, I kill me sometimes... Um. Hello? Is this thing on? *taps microphone*  \n* **Gugure! Kokkuri-san**: Pass.  \n* **Gundam G no Reconguista**: Wait... TWO new Gundams? Really? /r/gundam must be creaming themselves this season. Good for them.  \n* **Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru**: Hm. It kinda looks interesting. Then again, it kinda doesn't. So \"maybe\" it is for now.  \n* **Bonjour Koiaji Patisserie**: Aaaaaaaand here's my reverse harem for the season. The anime gods have smiled fondly upon my interests so far.  \n* **Ushinawareta Mirai o Motomete**: I can't say why exactly, but I'm getting a good vibe from this one. So count me in.  \n* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: Nope. Not in my interest group at all. But if a combat shounen were to get my attention, this might be one of them.  \n* **Hi-sCoool! SeHa Girl**: I remember the last anime that was sponsored by a game company. Did anyone but me watch Wonder Momo this year? Probably not, because it was even worse than Pupa. So I'll be wary for this one and just automatically pass on it. Also, too: Weird names just don't do anything for me.  \n* **Shirobako**: Because it's a P.A. Works original, I'll give it a chance. I've had great luck with P.A. Works titles in the past and I have no reason to expect that to change now.  \n* **Sanzoku no Musume Ronia**: You had me at \"Miyazaki\".  \n* **Garo: Honoo no Kokuin**: Franchise? That means that other anime have come before it, right? So I'll pass for the same reason as I've passed on many other shows so far.  \n* **Mushishi Zoku-Shou Second Season**: That reminds me. I still need to catch up on Mushishi. I'll do that after I finish Space Brothers so I can watch the newest episodes while they air for a change.  \n* **selector infected WIXOSS**: Card game anime plus sequel to title I haven't seen equals a nope.  \n* **Tribe Cool Crew**: Dance anime? That's all we know? Not nearly enough information to interest me, yet enough to make me lean towards *nope*.\n\nTotals: \n\nYes: 16  \nMaybe: 5  \nNope: 21\n\nNot a bad list so far. Although I might just be so crammed with anime this season, with three anime carrying over from Summer bringing the total to 19, that the \"maybe\" list gets pushed back to marathon-later status. \n\nSpecials: \n\nKill la Kill, Gokukoku no Brynhildr (for completionist tendencies only), Sabagebu!, Nisekoi (More Onodera? Why, thank you!), SYD*, and Yuruyuri (AKARIIIIN~!).  \n\nMovies:  \n\nGITS: Arise, Yamoto 2199, and Shingeki no Kyojin.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409296630", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This just in,  people who breathe are at much higher risk for contracting cancer! \n\nA new study by the think tank statistrix  has shown conclusively in a triple blind,  controlled study that people engaging in breathing activities are at a much greater risk for contracting just about every type of cancer. \n\n\"the correlation between breathing and cancer is just insanely high\" said a breathless Dr.  Garlufen,  \"and it's not just with pulmonary cancers,  as you might expect.\" \n\nDr Garlufen went on to explain that \"in no cases did we see the development or progression of cancer among the non breathing subjects\"  from the study,  which included over twelve thousand participants,  and was so large that it caused revisions in zoning laws due to the sudden growth in local population.  Local residents were heard to complain about some of the subjects \"they just lay there,  blocking roads,  driveways,  and liquor stores\". One resident,  with a particularly strong Irish accent commented \"I mean,  so it's great that they aren't getting cancer,  you know,  but they fooking stank to high heaven! \"\n\nThe study also hints toward a number of unexpected hazards of breathing apparently unknown before.  Although the authors of the study stop short of drawing scientific conclusions on the matter, they do state that \"significant relationships between breathing and other public health concerns such as diabetes,  car accidents,  and substance abuse\"  may also be in play.  Researchers were careful to state,  however,  that such other effects would require \"a lot,  really a lot\"  more funding to study in detail. \n\n\"We breathe just about everywhere,  in public, in our homes,  on the bus,  and we don't even give it a second thought\",  one researcher told reporters.  The risk is thought to be particularly high for children,  who are easily influenced by the bad examples of their parents and peers. \"I shudder to think\"  says one parent \"just yesterday I was telling my daughter to calm down and take a deep breath!\" \n\nAs might be expected,  corporate interests are jumping on the bandwagon too,  with a representative from the Institute for Tobacco Studies saying \"our products have been falsely implicated for decades\",  further explaining that \"clearly,  the evidence is in.  Breathing is thousands of times more carcinogenic than smoking\",  adding that \"this kind of miscarriage of justice is what happens when a bunch of frumpy old scientists get together with their Lynch mob mentality,  and just start pointing fingers at companies because they have a popular product.\"  \"just think of the cancers we could have prevented if we were focused on the real culprit,  rather than trying to squeeze a few pennies from helpless tobacco farmers.\" \n\nWall Street is taking the news well too,  it seems,  with analysts bullish on tobacco stocks,  citing \".... Billions in recouperary reparations\"  from the now obviously fraudulent lawsuits. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409315198", "subreddit": "Android", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

From the [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault):\n\n&gt;In common law, assault is the act of creating apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact with a person.\n&gt;\n&gt;An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.\n\nAssault doesn't require an act of attempted injury, merely the implication that injury would be imminent, even if conditional.\n\nFor example, a 12-year-old boy with no obvious weapons saying, \"wot m8 i fukin kill you\" isn't likely assault because there's no reasonable belief he could back up the threat.  An average woman with a baseball bat saying, \"I'm gonna crack your head in if you don't give me your purse\" is an assault because the bat gives him a credible capability of serious injury.  A heavily built man who looks to be a fighter of some sort saying, \"I'm going to pound your face into the ground and then choke you to death\" over the internet is likely not assault because unless he knows who you are and where you live he's not really capable of acting on the threat.

I think this because they're the guards / watcher of Nito and Agdayne in the crypt says that \"[we] weave death, and watch over the dead.\"\n\nThe old lady in the opening cinematic is also weaving! It might just be a coincidence though- however, the milfenitos let the little ones fly, and as lots of people have thought, the little ones could be the fireflies. The old lady in the opening cutscene guides you to a tree covered in these fireflies, who guide/ lure you to Drangleic. \n\nDoes anyone else thing Nito or his descendants are bringing you to Drangleic to find peace and death? I like the idea, but again, it's just a theory.\"\n\nYeah, he could have wrote it better. But what he wrote, I can easily comprehend the message he was putting across. It's not poorly constructed, hes just conveying a thought that came to mind that is actually a connection no one else has made.\n\nBut okay, \"Internet Badass\". Feel better for insulting someone and then whining when someone points out that you're the idiot instead for being incomprehensible. He doesn't have to be a genius to make a coherent theory, but apparently he does have to be a genius to explain his thoughts to someone so narrowminded like you.\n\nEdit: Judging from his comment history, he's actually German too.

{"body": "So I just tried the app and here's my thoughts:\n\n\n1. I usually can draw a bit and yet using this app to create drawings was excruciating. It's already difficult as it is to draw with your fingers and have no pressure sensitivity or anything else, but it's literally impossible to draw with no colours at all. It's fine that you want to monetise the app with in app purchases but the basic app should at least be playable. My suggestion is to add all shades of gray or sepia to the free app. Four different colours that don't mix are useless otherwise. One single colour in different lightness would more useful.\n\n1. It seems a lot of players were misguided: they thought they were installing a chat/messaging app and instead got a drawing play-game! They keep writing stuff and make little to no effort to draw anything, even dick drawings are too much to ask. They just keep trying to chat on: u wot mate?

CoD\n2. A video that is hilarious, despite trying to be or not.\n3. Gameplay of any other game, usually something completely unassociated with any community with the CoD fanboy ideology, the better the montage.\n\nHope this helps and remember montage parodies is just a pure crystal dose of satire and inside jokes that you just learn over time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409462059", "subreddit": "montageparodies", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
