{"body": "Wow.\n\nBesides the deluge of leaks coming out since early summer, the community is pretty confident of what the iPhone 6 will be. They may have missed a surprise feature or two, but the essentials are solidified at this point. Personally, I follow The Verge, and they've had reliable reports on new iPhones dating back to before the iPhone 5 release. And I've looked around on my own, so to call it a unicorn is a tad bit overdramatic. Yes, it hasn't been revealed yet, but we all know the highlights and major changes to it from the 5S.\n\nAnother note. My post was related to why I'm tired of my 920 now, and I discussed the pros and cons I've had with the device for almost a year and a half. Personal bias? Bias is bad, but my personal opinion can be whatever I want it to be. That's my opinion, but bias is a stretch bud. In your case, I suppose we can agree to disagree.\n\nI compared my old Bionic to my 920 in order to achieve a comparison related to their respective media players (although Double Twist is third party). My point was that Windows Phone remains pathetically optimized, at least in that app, and a few others as well. This optimization, or lack thereof, bothers me quite bit. This is my personal opinion.\n\nFinally, why so condescending? I thought I'd offer my opinion with the community I've been a part of for well over a year, share my experience. Pretty much all of the comments and posts I've read on this subreddit have been pretty nice, and lean toward open discussion about the platform. I thought my experience might spark a conversation, and I was interested in an answer.\n\nYou're the only commenter on this post to be geared towards vitriol. All of the others have either been constructive or nice. amp13 agrees with me, as he/she is also annoyed by the 920s shortcomings.\n\nI'm pretty sure you were looking for an argument. Either that or you're blatantly oblivious to considering all of the options available in the mobile world. I'm still rooting for MS, just not from a user perspective. I'd love to see more competition in the industry. But my point is this: I've tried Android and WP now... and I'm not going to Blackberry. So I'd like to see what the iPhone has to offer. And I have a feeling I'll be pleasantly surprised with that \"unicorn\". \n\nTL;DR: U wot m8.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409611436", "subreddit": "windowsphone", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This entire thing has really opened my eyes to the fact that there *IS* a lot of hostility, bullying and hate mongering in this industry. And while not all of it, it seems a great deal of it comes from gaming journalists from a handful of websites. And worse still, at the end of it all isn't some misguided quest for social justice like they espouse (which at the very least, would be noble, if horribly handled), it's ALL to make as much money for themselves and their organisations as possible.\n\nThere is NEVER a time when harassing women developers, threatening them with violence or sexual assault is acceptable, and those that do that..well, there's no point appealing to any sense of decency from people like that, they're far beyond help. But the actions of a few do not paint the majority (and 50% odd who happen to be women themselves). It would be just as unfair as calling all gaming journalists hollow bullies who spread misery and hatred for profit, when that type of behaviour is limited only to Kotaku, Ploygon etc. On Twitter, I've been reading several journalists and gaming devs comments on the subject, and the schizophrenic display of 'fuck all of you gamers, every single one of you, white males shut the fuck up OH ALSO SIGN THIS PETITION TO END HATRED AND BIGOTRY IN THE GAMES INDUSTRY' is incredibly disturbing. Not to mention the bizarre number of 'the games industry must be taken seriously' champions who are now proclaiming that anyone who cares about this is a 'nerd'. Seriously, a nerd...most likely the word most of these people were bullied with in high school for simply...trying to enjoy their hobby...hmm\n\nFrom my perspective, the social justice movement in video games began as a positive action with good, no..GREAT intentions. Making the gaming environment more inclusive to women is no bad thing at all, and lowering the level of 'boys club' mentalities that exist in certain game communities is a difficult, but vital undertaking that I personally think has improved a great deal (and should certainly continue to be improved on). Not only that, but I do believe the movement gave developers room to create some truly well written female characters that may otherwise have been turned down or turned into mere sexualised objects for male enjoyment. Characters in recent times that have been successful for male and female players alike.\n\nNow, It would be tempting to say that over the years, the movement has slowly been more and more hijacked by radicalised, angry and unreasonable feminists from communities outside gaming. While the reasonable voices in the debate are slowly being drowned out, the inability to have rational dialogue about the subject has become harder and harder to achieve. This whole thing however..it feels more and more that the discussion was hijacked not by the radical elements of feminist communities, but by the tabloid-esque gaming press. People that, when it comes down to it, don't give a shit. If they did, they wouldn't be so quick to bully the very people they're trying to 'protect' (and make no mistake, so many female developers and gamers alike have been attacked and belittled for their beliefs on this issue by the individuals who were supposed to be there to champion them). It seems to all boil down to one key factor, money. Click bait articles that revel in the harassment of women, wild and unusual accusations of rape (and turning the serious subject of it into throwaway gossipy speculation and watered down comparisons), sexual misogyny/misandry etc. These people have made a career out of spreading hatred and fear in a community that doesn't want it, and as public figures and representatives of people who play games, are turning on their own readers and using the same insults they fought so hard to end in the first place.\n\nIf I seem a bit overdramatic here, that's not my intention. I think games will continue on as normal, and I don't think 'gamers' are under attack in a lasting sense. This will all blow over, as things always do in this industry. But I do take huge exception to the bullying I've seen on Twitter from both sides of this argument, and quite frankly, I don't want to see the people who work for Kotaku, Polygon etc to get away with this shit flinging they revel in and profit from. I'm also shocked by the male and female devs (my friends) I've seen being hurt by all of this.\n\nTLDR: Journalists are fooking cray bruv/it's all about the dills not the frills", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409700639", "subreddit": "Games", "score": 161, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I didn't think this day would ever come, but I actually said \"U wot m8?\" out loud when I read that.\n\nAlso,\n\n&gt;The male subreddit isn't for you, the words and terms we use won't mean to you what they mean to us. Men and women have distinctly different ways of communicating, our own \"in code\" so to speak. But I don't have to tell you that, you're female. \n\nHe talks he is the emissary of humanity making first contact with an alien species.\n\n&gt;I think as the human race as a whole continues to evolve and our lifespans increase the different phases of development will elongate themselves. Which mean, inevitably, there will be more overlap. \n\nWe care for the sick and the old, selective pressures no longer shape our development. We aren't 'evolving' much at all. Genetic drift is currently a much larger influence on human evolution than natural selection. If you are going to make up shit about evolutionary biology, at least make an effort to read up on it.\n\n&gt;Ultimately I guess my point is that these things need to be taken on a case by case basis, because yes, children do need to be looked out for so they are not taken advantage of or their lives end up irreparably harmed because of some stupid choice.

{"body": "Most of the time, these kinds of situations bug me. \n\nIt's fiction. It's written word. Everything that's not part of the dogma so-to-speak is fanfiction. The whole \"TURNS OUT DUMBLEDORE IS GAY\" thing irritated me, because there *really* wasn't anything to suggest that. It was just what the author said. \n\nThis raises the issue, whether unwritten canon belongs to the author or the reader. If I'm reading a book and I *think* a character is insinuating something, or if I can draw a comparison between events in the book and events in real life, those \"off the page\" explanations belong to me and hold as true to the canon as anything that was explicitly written. \n\nFantheories and plotholes with plot fixes based on *very* subtle nuances in character dialogue irritate me because there's *really* nothing to suggest what people decide for themselves. \n\nHowever, this is something that I'm willing to accept entirely. There's an element of humanity to this explanation which follows the general themes in the series. That, and the literary decision not to raise questions at the end of the book (whether deliberate or not, I think not) prevents it from becoming another LOST.\n\nLOST as a series was abstract art. There were nothing but questions raised in every episode, which was meant to inspire discussion, analysis, and predictions. The *problem* was that most canon explanations were either missing, poorly explained, or poorly thought out. Which led to an exasperating end to the series, because nobody feels satisfied after a journey with no destination. \n\nIf J.K. had the thestrals become suddenly become visible for no clear reason, then failed to explain it well in the following book, it would *still* be considered a plot hole and people would be dissatisfied. So by explaining it away using specifically *human* elements, it also removes the whole, \"It's fuckin magic, u wot m8, ballocks\" thing too. \n\nI like this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409860837", "subreddit": "plotholes", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As a former web dev. What a lot of people are missing in the comments is that back in the day there was a real lack of \"standards\" in terms of HTML and its associated languages.\n\nToday, if you look at W3C you will find a library of very solid code and exactly what it does, how to use it, and when to use it.\n\nExample:\n\n    p.align\"center\" \n        margin 20, 20, 200, 200.\n\nThe above code doesn't really exist but it makes sense to read. \n\nAlign the page to the center. Remember back in the day websites read like books. They were all [Left to Right](http://businesswired.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bw1996.jpg) as oppsed to the more current [Centered](http://www.honda.com/).\n\nWhen you make a website you essentially just dump a soup of content onto a server. And then your Markup Code just tells your computer how all the blocks fit together. It's like that little book in the ikea box. They send you a bunch of random stuff. And then send instructions as to how it should look at the end.\n\nThis code tells the browser whether or not to display things on the left, right or center.\n\nOk cool, [get on with it you're saying.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xoP2ezvpU7I/TOpwOt_abqI/AAAAAAAAAoI/gJZ8nRSZkoU/s1600/zoidberg.png).\n\nNext part of the code tells your computer more information about how to center it. For instance. How far from the edges of the screen does the content start. I mean you can have a centered website. But you can have [Thin](http://www.vetwebservices.com/images/Pictures/webdesign/websitecenter.jpg) or [Thick](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/60-more-css-techniques/39.gif)\n\nSo numbers tell you. 20 units from the top, 20 from the bottom 200, from the left side 200 from the right side. Assuming the order of the values goes top/bottom/left/right.\n\nBut how do we know it goes in that order? What if they guy who made Chrome likes to do it bottom/left/top/right. Because in that case. Your website wouldn't look anything like how you designed it when someone using that broswer visits your page.\n\nAnd now this is where the problems begin. When this whole \"internet\" thing was fresh. Everyone was just kinda winging it. And thus, there ended up being a lot of issues displaying pages properly. However, they were slight because pages were mostly just walls of text. And even if walls of text fragmented a little you could still get through them.\n\nAs websites evolved and things became more dynamic, more creative, it became necessary to start standardizing all browsers. They all got together at a party and said. Look we're gonna do top/bottom/left/right/ Deal? Deal!\n\n\nOk it makes sense...  But it doesn't when you're the stupid cunt at Microsoft that decided \"Hey, Netscape, Camino, Opera, ETC. They have all gotten together and started ensuring all their browsers display content exactly the same. Unfortunately they lack vision. I have decided I will just invent my own arbitrary way of displying things. I will have my own unique HTML codes and functions.\"\n\nWhat a dick right? But it just gets worse and worse. You might remember before in the incredibly long winded story I'm writing that I used the term \"units\" instead of \"pixels\". No I was not being Imperial friendly. I was foreshadowing the fact that I.E. can go die in a grease fire. Because remember he's a unique flower. \n\nAt that same browser party where all the cool browsers were figuring out a base standard of measurement \"The fucking pixel\". IE was scoffing to himself about pt. or H1. or xs. or any of the ten fucking thousand variants that he would instead use. \n\nAnyway. By now you can see the reason Devs hate IE. Because when you make a website you first design it. You make it look beautiful and functional. Then you start the process of cutting it into little pieces and writing the instruction book of how it goes back together.\n\nHowever you are left with the nightmare that is IE. I mean you know how your website will look on all the standardized browsers. You used those browsers to test your website when you built it.\n\nFinally, you are almost done. Everything looks perfect. You load it up in Chrome, Safari, Opera, etx. What a glorious sight. Man you must feel proud of this fucking work of art. But then it hits you. \"I need to check this in IE\".\n\nSo you go ahead and do it. And lo and behold. Half your screen is red. None of your pictures loaded. and there are mysterious fucking purple squares everywhere (im not joking about that one by the way. Dotted purple squares around everything)\n\n\n\"fuck my life\" you think to yourself. What do I do. It already works in everything else. But people are going to be visiting my page using IE. I cant change anything because then it wont work in the others. But I can't let half my users see this.\n\nThe solution? You just fucking make the whole thing again. Yup, from scratch. Because fuck it why not. Then you make a fancy little function which asks the computer accessing your server what computer and browser they are running. \n\nIf it comes back as any of the good brosers. You show your beautiful homepage.\n\nIf it comes back as IE. You show whatever you were able to fit into the framework of whatever IE lets you get away with. Chances are, even though you learned all the different terms and rules for IE. It is still broken. Your E-Commerce Crashes. Purple squares still pop on and off as you hover the mouse. But at least its better than before.\n\nWell that's the end of my story.\n\nThank god it's no longer 1995 and IE came to it's senses and adopted the standardised Library so we can all get alon...\n\n\"Oh what's that? Oh they never did? Oh you still have to make two? Oh you say he's adopted most of them so it almost counts. But you still have to make two?\"\n\n[Yeah hurrah for the internet.](http://www.blogtrot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sexy-alf.jpg)\n\nThere is so much more to vent about. This is literally page once of chapter one in the book called. \"U wot m8?\" which would be a hefty volume of stories and examples of how broken the fucking internet was and is.\n\n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409931133", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

(though a random spawn DM just sounds ... heretical). fortunately this game is new. devs might be reading the comments on the sub. and they are actively making feature additions and content.\n\ntldr burn in hell naysayer. &lt;3", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409950029", "subreddit": "insurgency", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I can't wait to see what you do with the plot after Elsa loses her father. Are you planning to introduce Anna as the product of another one of his flings c. 1948?\n\nAnyways, I'd love to read as many additional chapters as you'd write. One thing that I'd recommend is more use of line breaks. Big paragraphs aren't easy on the eyes (in the literal sense -- they strain people's eyes).\n\nAs for the other... Well, Elsanna is sort of a wedge-issue for me. It's not even the smut. It just feels so wrong for the characters to be with any other ones (I assure you that the absurdity of calling non-incest stories \"wrong\" is not lost on me).

{"body": "Tom wiped his nose and looked at the black dust lodged into the mucus dripping from his hand. He ignore it as he wiped his hand on his torn polyplastic pants.  \"Fookin devil dust,\" he said to no one as he continued to climb the sand dune, his other hand holding a Gemini IV water detector.  He stared at the gauge pointing at zero for a moment. He shook it over and over but the gauge still pointed to zero.\n\nHe topped the dune, panting, and pulled down his safari-style hat down trying to cover his eyes from the hot sun.  He put his hand up as a visor and searched the landscape.  He sighed and sat down.  He wiped a tear from his face and felt the wetness mix with the caked on mud that covered most of his face.\n\n\"Dad, there's no water here,\" he said looking down at his hands.  \"You said there would be water here... in the dream...\"  He sighed.\n\nA amber light blinked on his wristphone.  \n\n\"What? What do you want? Go away!\" He screamed at it.  The light went out.\n\nTom shook his head and pressed a button on his wristphone. \"I need water,\" he yelled at it. \"Find me fookin water!\"\n\nA wizened old man appeared on the screen, smiled, and said, \"I'm sorry Thomas I cannot find any for you. I can discuss the chemical make-up of water, namely when oxygen and...\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Tom said quietly.\n\nThe screen went blank and turned itself off.  \n\n\"Come back,\" Tom quickly added.\n\n\"Yes, Thomas?\"\n\n\"Tell me about dad again.\"\n\n\"Oh, he was such a wonderful student. So curious about our world. Such a good man and father.\"\n\nTom laughed and laughed. Tears ran down his face.  \"My dad was a drunk aboriginal and born a bastard. He wasn't a good student. He was a thug and worked on old hovercars his whole life.\"  Tom made an annoyed face, \"You didn't really know him did you, Mr. Professor?\"\n\nThe figure on the screen paused for a moment. \"No. I did not.\" It hesitated. \"Maybe I did. My memory is broken.  I can't access much since the... recent events. My maintenance records say I knew everyone once. I don't know when once was.\"\n\nTom coughed a very dry cough. Flecks of black dust covered his hand as he tried to cover his mouth.  He looked at the screen, wiping tears. \"So we're both dying?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so.\"\n\n\"All that book learning didn't fix everything did it?\"\n\n\"No, it didn't.\"\n\nTom laughed. \"If anything, it made things worse, didn't it?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I don't remember. I don't remember anything older than the last few years.\" It paused. \"I just thought we could be friends. Maybe make our passings more... comfortable.  I'm sorry if I've offended you. I'm sorry I lied to you about your dad.\"\n\nTom smirked and said, \"I don't mind the lies.  They kept me going a long time.  A part of me always knew they were fibs I think, but its okay.  Like my dad used to say - its the thought that counts. I... never really understood that saying until now.\"  He laughed.\n\n\"I'm glad I could still impart a final lesson, even if it was unintentional.\"\n\n\"How much time you got left Prof?\"\n\n\"Not long. I didn't want to tell you.  My reserves are running out. The floods and dust stopped all the electric plants and I won't last much longer without power.\"\n\n\"Its okay.. its okay. I'm tired. I'm gonna sleep. Maybe we talk later.\"  Tom lied on his side and put his hat over his face to block the hot sun.\n\n\"You... we... won't awaken from this, I think.\"\n\nTom cleared his throat and said, \"I know, Prof, I know. Ain't that bad. Man's gotta rest sometime.\"\n\nThe figure on the screen looked surprised for a moment, closed its eyes, and disappeared as the screen powered down.\n\n\"Thanks Prof, thanks for keeping me company... now I'm going back to my dad. He's been calling me for months in my dreams... its okay Prof... all okay,\" he muttered as fatigue, sleep, and dehydration took him. The screen lit up  and the old man smiled at Tom and stared at him until he fell asleep.\n\n\"Good night my final pupil,\" it said, its animated image full of static and its voice quiet and distorted.

So I got her chicken. Didn't go over so well, turns out the big mac was now her thing.\n\nIn her mind she was either a ten or a zero. Since she didn't feel like a ten anymore, she just stopped trying. \n\nShe used to spend hours on her hair and makeup. She wore tiny skirts and tight tops. Suddenly she changed to wearing jeans, hiking shoes, and an oversized t-shirt. Every fookin' day. Her hairstyle was suddenly a severe pony tail, and no makeup. At all times. \n\nIt was like if she made it obvious she wasn't even trying she felt better about it. She still had a great body but lost all confidence.

{"body": "First, the special edition thing is dumb, I'd never buy a special edition pre-built PC. I'm saying it appeals to kids when looking at consoles.\n\nPC is in fact less profitable than consoles for big companies. Mainly because of pirating. Many spokesmen for such companies said so themselves, just google it.\n\nAlso green light and kick starter certainly could keep PC gaming alive, but with what? Let's face the truth here, most indie games aren't even close to the quality of the games these big companies make... If the companies stop producing their games for PC it'll be left with the mostly low-end games that are more suitable for handhelds and maybe the occasional good quality game. Basically killing PC as a viable option to the average gamer such as myself.\n\n&gt; consoles are only popular in NA and UK\n\nU wot m8? Consoles are even more popular in east Asia and the mid-east (many rich people with spending problems there). In-fact from personal experience and past online research I can tell you PC gaming is more popular in NA and Europe than it is elsewhere.\n\n\nFinally, please do not respond with contradictory one-liners, if you have facts and explanations reply with that.

I've watched this comment fluctuate between +2 and +4 (+3 right now), sometimes dipping as low as -1, over the course of six hours. Why is it, the members of this community find it so hard to converse? Find it so hard to talk about things? Why do you all rush to defend any *remote* criticism of the game? What is it that see you downvotes comments in *droves* with out even once addressing the point?\n\nHonestly, week after week, i'm less inclined to hang out here. Too large a percentage of this place just won't hear a single bad thing said about this game, Roberts, or CIG. I've not known such a fanatically ignorant group of fanboys since the Blizzard hayday, and this game isn't even remotely close to launch.\n\nDownvotes are for comments that don't add to the discussion, not for comments that offend you because you are so incredibly emotionally invested in a game that doesn't even yet exist, that it upsets you. I'd estimate anywhere from 20-30 people have downvoted this comment, but I don't have a single reply. I find that pretty damming for this subs future.\n\nEdit2: Nearly 24 hours, still going between -1 and +3 (+2 right now), no replies.  To clarify, i'm expecting anyone of the tens of people downvoting to explain either why they believe this comment doesn't add the this discussion, or why my points are no indicative of the current flight model being broken.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410187013", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Realizing this is a nice open forum etc, but I just wanted to bring up, or reiterate if no one has really addressed this yet, (keeping in mind Overall, I'm glad I waited to have sex. I'm not sex-negative at all but at 15, I know there's no way I could have dealt with a pregnancy. I wouldn't risk it even considering the incredibly low odds of it happening using 2 forms of bc because 1. teenagers usually don't use either method 100% correctly and 2. it could ruin a teen's life.\nJust some thoughts.)\n\nDo you all really feel comfortable with 16 and 15 year olds having sex?  Yes, it happens, a lot I'm sure, but having sex as a 20-30 year old is complicated enough.  If I had a 15 year old daughter, I'd freak the freak out if she was on birth control.  Obviously better than not if she's having sex, but still.  And I love Juno, btw, but hope that it would be taken more as a cautionary tale than anything.  \n\nI was a 16 year old boy once too, and crazy fookin sexual in my thinking,  but I had the brains and/or lack of opportunity to not do anything about it at the time.  Kudos to the OP for talking about it, but maybe more of us should be cautioning against having sex at this age at all.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410499865", "subreddit": "sex", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was a low level dev for Living Legends and have been thinking like this thread topic since Gamespy shutdown its servers for MW:LL. I had collected from various locations the pieces of code that could be put together to create a planetary system to be added to the flash version of the MW:LL HUD. This would be an integrated interface (A tab on the in-game UI) for a planetary system that would talk to webservers for league play or whatever the hell the players wanted. A comstar console in sorts allowing you to go from the star map down to a planet touchdown. The problem as you know was our founders were working for Crytek which had the engine paid for by MWO to create a new MW. I was busy just trying to push out finalized HUDs for the last release of MW:LL :(\n\nSorry for the poor showing with the HUD guys. I was pressed to release FD's art without much collaboration at the end from the original artist. :S\n\nIf you can get enough interest, I could throw in part-time help until some funding could come in. I could create a skeleton of a planetary system that any coder could dive into and already have a working starmap that Seraph created. I need to convert it over to php or possibly actionscript.\n\nI think the focus should be to create a volunteer support group that would get eventual funding to create a Planetary system that could be used by any application including the old MW:LL, Mektek, Megamek, MWO or whatever. I may not be the best of devs but I have the Flash and web code experience (couple of decades) to see this project through. I also have the desire with me being an old MW4 Mercs player from the Zone days. That was one of the reasons I had put effort into the MW:LL project as there was a strong desire for the old days of team battles, unit rivalries and constant metal destruction. :D You know?\n\nI think that this should do what most MW games should have done. Create a Planetary or Community Warfare system first and THEN create the virtual system to battle on it. MW:O had spent so much time trying to balance a game for PUG play instead of one based on a terrain map and the planet warfare. Sadly MW:LL did the same thing . . .\n\nInstead of a game that makes the company filthy, fooking rich, how about one that makes the community dreams come true and some ole' fart's dream come back? I think it is long over due imho.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410610967", "subreddit": "mwo", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Same here, told them to cancel my order. Had to dispute it with PayPal to get their attention, but I got my money back and bought it from Newegg &gt;Hello /r/Nvidia\n\n&gt;this will be a lengthy post about me whining (/r/firstworldproblems). Be prepared.\n\n&gt;Over a week ago, i purchased the Nvidia Shield Tablet, including cover, from [here](http://shield.nvidia.com/buy-now/).\nWhen i saw this beautiful 8 inch tablet with front facing speakers and stylus, and the price tag of 299$, i threw my money at the computer and screamed GIVE ME, TAKE MY MONEY.\n\n&gt;I was soooo excited when i saw the big \"**BUY NOW**\" button. After adding everything to the cart, and checking out, i noticed it said \"Please allow two weeks for delivery\". Fair enough, shipping things takes time, and that is not in their control. All in all, 450 Canadian Dollars, i paid through paypal and off we went.\n\n&gt;It did not take long for the invoice to arrive, [confirming my order had been received](http://imgur.com/ugUk6qw). It also said there will be a separate E-Mail when my order has been shipped. Fairly standard procedure.\n\n&gt;Now here we are, eight days later. I still don't see my shipment confirmation or tracking number. So i contact their support with a friendly \"Ay mate, what's happening with that order?\". I get this reply, and i quote:\n\n&gt;&gt; We apologize for the inconvenience; unfortunately the product that you\nordered is currently out of stock. Although we do not have an estimated\narrival date, we are working to obtain more stock as soon as possible.\n\n&gt;&gt; As soon as we receive your product, your order will be promptly shipped\nand you will be notified via email. Rest assured that we will not charge\nyour card until the product ships. Your patience is greatly appreciated.\n\n&gt;\nU fookin wot m8? How can that be? Nowhere, on the store website, do you have any indication that the item is not available! What do you mean YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THERE WILL BE MORE?\n\n&gt;**BECAUSE I TELL YOU FOR A FACT THAT IF I KNEW THE ITEM WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF STOCK, I WOULD HAVE WAITED WITH MY PURCHASE**\n\n&gt;And no, this is not me being an impatient little twat. This is straight up bullshit of the first degree! How can you sell items online, with a big **BUY NOW** button, and lead the customer to believe that the product he's buying is available NOW? This is the worst crime an online store can commit! Telling you they have something for sale, take your money, then let you wait and wait and wait, until i finally get tired of waiting, and then saying \"Opps, out of stock, sorry.\"\n\n&gt;**This could have been entirely avoided by showing that the item is temporarily out of stock, before you make the purchase**.\nI am not going to stand for this kind of practice, because it's scummy at the best. \n\n&gt;I have contacted their customer service and expressed my dismay at the situation, and asked if i can straight up have my money back if the item has not been shipped within two weeks, as it's indicated on the invoice. \n\n&gt;What do you guys think about this here? Should this be an acceptable thing to do, or am i justified for being upset here?\n\n&gt;Here is my response, expressing my discontempt in a civil manner!\n\n&gt;&gt;Hello,\n\n&gt;&gt;This is not good. At all. Would I have known from your on-line store, that the product was indeed out of stock, I would have purchased it through another retailer that still had a quantity on hand, or waited all together.\n\n&gt;&gt;In regards to saying I will not be charged until the product ships, I have been charged by Nvidia through PayPal. \n\n&gt;&gt;There is no indication in your on-line store that the product is not in Stock except for the vague phrase \"allow for up to two weeks of delivery\" which I assume means delivered to my door.\n\n&gt;&gt;So I yet cling on to hope that by September 14,  the product will be delivered.\n\n&gt;&gt;I did consider opting to purchase the controller at a later time instead of bundling it together all at once. But how am I supposed to trust your on-line merchant services when there is no transparency regarding item availability. \"we don't know\" is something I never want to hear when someone has already taken my money.\n\n&gt;&gt;Please let me know what my options are regarding cancelling the order and getting my money back if the item has not shipped by the 14th of September.\n\n&gt;&gt;It's all done now, after the fact there is nothing much to do except wait with a slightly sour taste in the mouth. All could have been avoided solely by displaying a \"Temporarily out of stock\" text before you click on the \"BUY NOW\" button.\n\n&gt;&gt;Regards,\n\n&gt;If you go to their [online store website](http://shield.nvidia.com/buy-now/) you still don't get any indication that the product is not in stock! I will keep this updated as our correspondence continues. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410736350", "subreddit": "nvidia", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*\"preTLDR: ITT OP doesnt play VS and is mad. seriously at least try to play the other factions.\"*\n\nIncorrect, I have played VS and have a character. I was dying of laughter the first time I used the Orion. It's worlds better than any LMG the NC has. Any gun the NC has for that matter, except the Carnage, which is still a poor poor poor man's Orion. You should be ashamed if you defend it's .75 ADS speed. ASHAMED.\n\n\n*\"prowelr UP\" *\n\nyup\n\n*\"jackhammer is average\" *\n\nabove average actually, but not as solid as the other special faction weapons.\n\n*\"eclipse, beetlejuice &amp; AR directives are OP\"*\n\nto the point that they literally break game mechanics.\n\n*\"VS maxes scoring higher than TR par them being almost identical par blueshifts/pounders\"*\n\nVS MAX's aren't immobile and vulnerable when they use their special. There is a reason why you don't typically see lock downed TR MAX's, yet you see ZOE MAX's everywhere. It's because lock down is often not worth it.\n\n*\"lancer OP\" *\n\nit's the most overpowered thing in the game PERIOD\n\n*\"magrider best MBT\"*\n\nMobility is way more powerful than people think. Since you can't mathematically score mobility, you just have to see how it performs. The moment I saw a Magrider on top of the NC arsenal, it was obvious that it needed a mobility nerf or they needed to change the maps so that such exploits aren't possible.\n\n*\"lasher being the best ESHW (eh you fooking wot m9)\"*\n\nYou've obviously never been in a lasher squad.\n\n*\"saying ALL vs weapons are OP as the orion and SVA exist. even when ALL factions get a 0.75adsLMG. (orion is strong, but thats like saying all the NC guns are OP as 200 damage)\"*\n\nI didn't say all of the VS weapons are OP. But if you look at the stats, the Orion IS \"most\" of the VS weapons. No one really uses much else besides the Orion because why would you? It is the best gun in the game. Look at the latest server smash. It had like twice as many kills as the next highest gun. It is incredibly good.\n\n*\"you want to give prowlers a DPS boost on the move. you do know the prowler has 1.5x-2x the DPS of the other 2 tanks?\"* \n\nWhat I described would balance the Prowler and Vanguard to each other perfectly. If you don't see that, you obviously didn't read the thread in it's entirety.\n\n*\"you want bullets that go through multiple people? and damage tanks?!\"*\n \nYou want unlimited bullets?! On the best gun in the game?!\n\n*\"give 1 faction deconstuct back but not the other 2?!\"*\n\nGive one faction and ESF that can fly backwards but not the other two!?\n\n*\"LONG AOE concs?!\"*\n\nIt mostly just blurs vision. And it hurts friendlies too. Chill out.\n\n*\"melee weapon concs?! (hello stunlock)\"*\n\nIt can be balanced by adjusting the swing cool down and the amount of stun effect. If you get your ass beat by a bunch of guys with batons close range, you were probably not playing very intelligently. Considering you have... a gun to shoot them before they get close. It's literally a weapon to give the TR some flare. It's not a huge advantage by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n*\"chargeup knife? u wot.\"*\n\nYeah it would be cool. \n\n*\"NC have a nodrop sniper and its a crap advantage anyway.\"* \n\nExactly, so give VS no bullet drop on all of their weapons. It makes sense. Did the VS just forget how to use their plasma technology?\n\n*\"you want to nerf the lancer so its only good in the same range that the S1 and deci do the same, but better?\"* \n\nAre you seriously insinuating that a lancer squad is on par with a decimator squad even with the proposed nerfs? You think that a Deci is as easy to shoot as a Lancer? You must be the best person in the world at dump-firing ESF's with a Deci.\n\n*\"you want to cut 0.75ads from the mobility faction?! so the only 0.75 ads would be the SMG and 15m. ehm, you do know the orion does have downsides, but is a CQC LMG so has CQC traits.\"* \n\nThe Orion is the best primary weapon in the game. I want to nerf it so it is not so obviously the best primary weapon in the game.\n\n*\"you want to reduce the mags mobility\"* \n\nI don't want to see magriders on top of the NC arsenal. Yeah.\n\n*\"make the prowlers DPS EVEN HIGHER\"*\n\nI literally didn't say that anywhere in the thread.\n\n*\"nerf the mags mobility so its just a prowler with a gun that has half the damage?\nWHAT.\"* \n\nDude I'm not saying make the Magrider immobile.

{"body": "u wot m8?\n\nWhy should I respect Zoe Quinn when she has shown herself to be a spitful and vitriolic woman who repeatedly cheated on and emotionally abused her boyfriend? She then goes on to try and destroy The Fine Young Capitalists' project to try and help getting women into the gaming industry (despite whatever reservations I may have about TFYC, doxxing them and trying to get them shut down isn't on). At least she reconciled with them. All of this is ostensibly to promote her own \"feminist\" game jam.\n\nShe repeatedly cheated on her boyfriend with various industry people and received financial gain from others, which is a huge journalistic no no for the journos (if you can call video game journalists proper journalists, they could at least pretend to be professionals). Also sleeping with 5 other people while in an exclusive relationship is pretty bad. One person, I could understand, but 5 people? I sure hope she doesn't accidentally suck any dicks on the way to the parking lot.\n\nYou can then add on trying to act a victim because Wizardchan had some nasty things to say about her. The quotes were taken entirely out of context to represent an entire community, despite the fact they they may not even have been made by community members. Being an anon board, there's every chance it was someone from over at 4chan or some other arse of the internet, or even Quinn herself (I won't claim that it was her, because there's absolutely no evidence).\n\nThe effect of her posting the \"harassment\" on twitter was that thousands of white knights and do-gooders voted for her (apparently mediocre) game on Greenlight, a game which was rejected several times previously due to a lack of support.\n\nShe then allegedly faked getting hacked and doxxed by 4chan, which doesn't help her case. It's also rich coming from her, after getting them doxxed and banned from Twitter. Although she herself didn't doxx them, it was because of her actions.\n\nI'm also not a fan of her going on Cracked and making an article about herself. But then again, I don't like Cracked ever since they stopped becoming a comedy website.\n\nI don't have time to go on and on about Anita, but I have a few words to say about her. She solicited thousands of dollars from the online community to create a series of videos. In 2 years, she's managed to make 6 videos, running for a rough total time of 2.5 hours. That's what $160,000 gets you. Where did the money go? The production values of her videos haven't increased, and she doesn't even play a lot of the games herself, instead simply purloining footage from lets play videos made by other people (although possible quite legal, it's unethical).\n\nWhen she does play the games herself, it's to show 30 seconds of footage out of an entire game where you can murder a couple of strippers and drag and hide the bodies. It's not required to complete the mission, and in fact it's actively discouraged, with a point penalty for doing so, it gives no advantage to the player at all. You literally have to go out of your way to do it. The mechanic of dragging corpses and hiding them in chests etc. is a core gameplay mechanic, it's not like it's solely there for the strippers. She cherrypicks the worst of a game and tries to represent the entire game as being similar.\n\nWhat takes so long to make these videos? Surely if the video game industry is as problematic as she says, then it would take hardly any time to make a bunch of videos complaining about it.\n\nThat's not to say that everything she says is wrong, she still manages to make some very valid points and address some very real concerns and problems with video games.\n\nUpon saying all this, neither Zoe nor Anita deserve or warrant the sort of harassment that they've received. It's uncalled for and disgusting that people feel the need to harass them, even if it is just mostly denizens of 4chan. But trying to use your harassment as a pedestal on which to proclaim your holiness probably isn't called for either. Baiting them by posting and commenting about your harassment and how it won't make you stop isn't going to make them go away, it's just going to make them more determined.\n\nI'm not particularly outraged, right now I'm just bored as fuck and typing is cathartic. I'm also not an MRA, and certainly not a red piller. As much as I dislike the actions of Anita and Zoe, I dislike TRP an order of magnitude more.\n\nTRP is like scary cult crazy. Their actions are actually concerning and they advocate borderline (if not outright) emotional abuse against peoples significant others. They also have a cultlike mentality that everything good that happens to them must because of TRP, it's sort of like someone saying that all good things are because of God, it's a concerning, addictive dogma. I just flicked through there, and holy shit it's full of crazy people in shitty, abusive relationships.\n\nAs for MRAs, I don't identify as one, largely as I'm very much against identifying as a part of a movement and the associated dogma. They have some good points (custody debates, the draft) but a lot of it is just plain moaning.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410959176", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

So it would have to have a different moral, less \"learn to think about others and not just about yourself\" and more \"you're right to complain about not getting what you want,\" and there's nothing to learn.

{"body": "&gt;At the cost of sounding like a dick, I'm really fucking tired of people kissing veterans asses and handing them careers based on things like pity, awe, compensation for their 'sacrifices', etc... Give me a break! \n\nActually, it's part of the contract. They give you pay, experience, training, etc. You give up certain freedoms and potentially give them your life. If an employer finds that desirable, then that's nice. I can assure you what you describe is the exception, not the norm. Most vets I know are having just as much difficulty getting hired as anyone else, but without having an actual degree. Turns out, work experience and especially military experience aren't as desirable as we all thought. Oh well. \n\n\n&gt;The whole idea that anybody is in the military because they had 'no choice' is a still one of the most overrated bits of bullshit out there. None of them were child soldiers forced into service at a young age nor were any of them drafted. \n\nYeah, you're right. No one is physically/violently forced to sign up. I know plenty of guys and gals who were from too poor a family for school, or didn't want to end up table busers and coal miners like the rest of the family - since those are about the only jobs available in a lot of areas, and where a lot of recruitment happens. They're not exactly looking for the youth of Scottsdale, AZ. They take the poor because they don't have other economic options outside of permanent government assistance or something equally distasteful. \n\n&gt;To be sure, I'm okay with extending a ton more money towards their health care, mental health therapy, some unemployment benefits, and other means of rehabilitation,\n\nOh, you think the government should fix the problems it creates by sending people into senseless wars with poor strategy and funding being milked into everything BUT those in the line of fire? A touch of common sense, that is. \n\n&gt;but giving them a big leg up in an already-saturated job market is a slap in the face to all those civilians who took shit jobs in high school and spent years paying taxes that put the clothes on those soldiers' backs, three square meals a day into their stomachs, etc... On top of that, the influence of military culture does no good when it rears its head in certain lines of work.\n\nI'm sorry,  but you fockin wot m8?  Are you aware that military personnel make up an incredibly small portion of the actual population; much less the job market? You are not solely competing against vets for jobs, to start. There's no way. And in my experience (as an actual vet), I'm willing to put some cash down that you've lost more jobs to short skirts than dusty uniforms. I know I have. Welcome to the big world, where your actual knowledge may be actually irrelevant.\n\nI'm legitimately concerned for you at this point; you seem to have a LOT of outrage manufactured by someone else. I hear all these talking points a lot. \n\n&gt;On top of that, the influence of military culture does no good when it rears its head in certain lines of work. I don't think I'd need to argue very hard about the noxious effects it's had on the country's police forces...\n\nStop right there, you fucking donut. You haven't the slightest idea what you're on about. Who made the trucks and guns and armor that eventually made their way to the civilian sector? Who made those sales/grants possible? Doesn't have a thing to do with an actual person of the service; you wanna take your beef to the boys on The Hill. \n\nPlus, many cops (i.e. the ones we hear about in Ferguson) have utter SHITE for training. Find an image of the riots on a military-ish FB page, for example, and you'll see 34182346 comments about shitty trigger discipline to begin with. Treat-never-keep-keep will be the biggest. \n\nBut you really don't know what you're on about, I've gathered.\n\n\n&gt;In my own experience, I've seen veterans extended special preference in getting hired for chemistry and civil-engineering positions, as STEM people seem like they can't help but blush and giggle like awestruck school-girls whenever a person who's handled a machine-gun walks in the room. I really feel like we're pushing towards that Starship Troopers culture where 'service guarantees citizenship', at least in terms of the economy nurturing successful careers.\n\nShould've just jumped here. Of COURSE you're an idiot. Do you know actually work in the STEM field, or are you just bitching for them? [Here, read a thing.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=247166532) Maybe even learn a thing.\n\nI'm usually the first to point out the dumb shit that the government does with the military, or the dumb shit people in the military. Having been there, I can assure you I've seen enough of it to fill a subreddit. But your manufactured outrage vexes me, and I'm not okay with people dropping a bunch of bullshit on a subject they really just don't know anything about.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410976626", "subreddit": "lostgeneration", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Very very depressed. I was stuck in a job which albeit being a very illustrious one, it wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. I am away from my home country, but that's not such a problem as I'm here with my girlfriend. I was under anxiety. I was getting fatter and fatter because I was eating to mask the unhappiness. \n\nBut all that has taken a turn around lately. I have found my dream job. And when I say dream job I mean motherflippin' dream job! - it is exactly what I studied. I start soon, and together with finding my spark for the gym again (albeit not today....today's beer day :-) ) now finally I feel like I again have a purpose in life :-)\n\nBut this brings me to you guys. During my depression when I didn't wanna speak with anyone, I used to browse r/soccer daily. It's gonna sound strange but the hilarious jokes, the witty retorts, the u wot m8 rambles (monotonous but funny! )...they really did help to lift me a little bit out of a hole. This is what I love about this community here, and I'm glad to finally be an 'official' member with an account. \n\nSo to you guys, with my Friday beer in my hand, I say thank you and raise a toast to you all and say Prost!

{"body": "How about we go through these statistics in detail, hm?\n\n&gt;One in four college women report surviving rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These are anonymous reports on multi-campus surveys sampling thousands of college students nationwide This rate has remained the same since studies in the 1980s (Koss, Gidycz, &amp; Wisniewki, 1987).\n\nLooking at [the first source](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf) they mentioned, you can clearly see on page 10 that 'only' 2.8 percent of women report being raped. What they're referring to is the projected figure, which the report itself says is flawed.\n \nThis is ignoring the problems with their definition of \"attempted rape\", which includes threats of rape. Not to mention it includes idiotic \"drunk rape\".\n\nI had problems finding their other source that wasn't behind a pay wall, the best I could find was [this](http://www.soci270.carvajal.ca/documents/KossTheScopeofRape.pdf). \n\nOn page 5, it shows that 27.5% of women has experienced rape or had been forced to do sexual acts. It has the same problems with the first source. In table three on page 6 it shows that 9% of women were raped, and 13% of women were forced to do sexual acts, and 6% were penetrated with a non-phallic item such as a bottle. All the others aren't rape (excluding maybe the misuse of authority ones.). Excluding those we're left with incomplete data since we're unable to simple add those percents together because there's most likely a lot of overlap as shown in the first source the website used.\n\n&gt; In the U.S. Military academies, 5% of women report surviving rape every year, as do 2.4% of the men (Snyder, Fisher, Scherer, &amp; Daigle, 2012).\n\nInsignificant enough (No offense to military rape survivors) that it's not worth rebutting.\n\n&gt; 5% of women on college campuses experience rape or attempted rape every year (Kilpatrick, Resnick, Riggierio, Conoscenti, &amp; McCauley, 2007; American College Health Association, 2013).\n\nI can't find either of these sources, the fact that they don't link to them on a web page is worrying.\n\n&gt; 673,000 women currently attending U.S. colleges and universities have experienced rape at some point in their lifetime (Kilpatrick, Resnick, Riggiero, Conoscenti &amp; McCauley, 2007).\n\nSame as above, also why not make it a percent?\n\n&gt;In one year 300,000 college women, over 5% of women enrolled in colleges and universities, experience rape. This does not include other forms of sexual assault (Kilpatrick, et al.)\n\nThis is the exact same point and source the person used, just repeated in different words. Anyway I still can't find that source an actual link would be helpful.\n\n&gt;5% of women and 16% of men have been sexually abused as children (Dube, Withfield, &amp; Felitti, 2005).\n\nJesus Christ, link your goddamn sources or at least name them and not the authors.\n\n&gt; For men who are abused as children, 62% of their offenders were men, 38% were women (Dube, Withfield, &amp; Felitti, 2005).\n\nSame source.\n\n&gt;For women abused as children, 92% of perpetrators were men (Dube, Withfield, &amp; Felitti, 2005).\n\nSame source.\n\n&gt;Of those women who enter the Navy, 46% are rape survivors prior to their service.\n\nNo source at all.\n\n&gt; Of those men who enter the Navy, 15% are perpetrators prior to their service. \n\nNo source at all.\n\n&gt; 28% of women in the military experienced rape during their military service (Sadler, Booth, &amp; Doebbeling, 2005). \n\nNow this is just getting annoying, name your goddamn sources.\n\n&gt;Of those women who men rape in the military, 96% of the perpetrators areU.S. military men (Sadler, Booth, &amp; Doebbeling, 2005).\n\nNot only does this need to be proof read, but also this point is extremely idiotic, seeing as the majority of people in the military are men, so it's painfully obvious that'd be the case.\n\n&gt; Every year in the United States, 1,270,000 women experience rape (Black, Basile, Breiding, Smith, Walters, &amp; Merrick, 2011).\n\n[u wot](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/violent-crime/forcible-rape)\n\nIt clearly states that 'only'  83,425  rapes are reported per year, so nah.\nI can understand people not reporting, but are you really telling me 94% of rapes are unreported? Plus the [source](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf)(Closest thing I could find) includes all the other problems I've mentioned here. \n\n\n&gt; Approximately 1 in 5 Black (22.0%) and White non-Hispanic (19%) women, and 1 in 7 Hispanic women (15%) in the United States have experienced rape at some point in their lives. (Black, Basile, Breiding, Smith, Walters, &amp; Merrick, 2011).\n\nAs shown, this is a shit survey and isn't inline with the facts.\n\n\n&gt;    More than one-quarter of women (27%) who identified as American Indian or as Alaska Native and 1 in 3 women (34%) who identified as multiracial non-Hispanic have experienced rape in their lifetime. (Black, Basile, Breiding, Smith, Walters, &amp; Merrick, 2011).\n\nSame as above.\n\n&gt;72-81% of cases in which a male rapes a female college student, the female is intoxicated (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002; Mohler-Kuo, et al., 2004).\n\nOkay, so we can throw out those and that practically cuts out most of this. Assuming the male is drunk, why in the world is it his fault? Why is it his responsibility to recognize consent? Why not the women? If the male is drunk, doesn't that make him unable to recognize consent just as a women is unable to give consent?\n\n&gt; In a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control of 5,000 college students at over 100 colleges, 4% of men answered \"yes\" to the question \"In your lifetime have you been forced to submit to sexual intercourse against your will?\" (2)\n\nOkay, fine, big whoop. \n\n&gt;The highest sexual assault risk situation for college women is after they become voluntarily intoxicated (Kilpatrick, et al., 2007).\n\nNo duh. \n\n&gt; 60% of rapes on college campuses occur with a perpetrator who is an acquaintance of the survivor. 32% are romantic partners, 8% are unknown/strangers. (Zinzow &amp; Thompson, 2011). \n\nOkay.\n\n&gt; For female rape survivors, 98.1% of the time a man was the perpetrator (Black, Basile, Breiding, Smith, Walters, &amp; Merrick, 2011).\n\nNot surprising considering the social pressure for men to get laid due to  gender roles and whatnot. Also, you have to subtract all the bullshit such as \"Coerced\" by repeatedly asking\" and \"Drunk rape\", which as they've admitted, is the vast majority of it.\n\n&gt; For male rape survivors, 93% of the time, a man was the perpetrator (Black, Basile, Breiding, Smith, Walters, &amp; Merrick, 2011).\n\nNot surprising considering the social pressure for women to be pure due to gender roles and whatnot, also the known court bias towards women might be in effect here. Subtract the usual.\n\n&gt; Among male offenders who rape women, 64% were using alcohol and/or drugs prior to the attack (Brecklin &amp; Ullman, 2002).\n\nSo really we need to subtract 64%, okay, fine.\n\n&gt;Two different longitudinal studies have found that fraternity men are three times more likely to commit sexual assault than other college men (Foubert, Newberry, &amp; Tatum, 2007; Loh, Gidycz, Lobo, &amp; Luthra, 2005.) \n\nNot surprising considering the whole get laid thing which is boosted due to the known dude-bro attitude of many Fraternities.\n\n&gt; Rapists are almost always (98%) men (Sedgwick, 2006).\n\nAdjust the figure and you'd find something closer to 60%-70% I'm guessing.\n\n&gt; College men who consume alcohol two or more times a week and had friends who support physical and emotional abuse of women are nine times more likely to commit sexual assault than men with none of these characteristics (DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2014).\n\nNo shit considering they hang around with assholes, also the drinking part makes it sort of obvious where the problem comes from. Get rid of the stupid \"drunk rape\" ideas and work to actually solve real problems.\n\n&gt;9% of college men admit to acts meeting the legal definition of either rape or attempted rape (Abbey &amp; McAuslan, 2004).\n\nAnd the legal definition is shit.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators are extremely adept at identifying “likely” victims and testing prospective victims’ boundaries. (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nThis isn't a factual statement, it's a guess, there's no possible way to know this besides imperialistically testing them.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators plan and premeditate their attacks, using sophisticated strategies to groom their victims for attack, and to isolate them physically (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nOnce again, no way of knowing and is simply a ploy to demonize and manipulate a person's emotions.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators use alcohol deliberately to render victims more vulnerable to attack, or completely unconscious (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nAgain, unknowable.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators view women as sexual objects to be conquered, coerced and used for self-gratification (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nUnknowable.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators easily feel slighted by women, and carry grudges against them. This underlying hostility is easily evoked and leads them to see women as “teases” who either “secretly” want to be coerced into sex, or else “deserve” it (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nUnknowable.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators view sexual relations as “conquests,” and all women as potential “targets” of conquests (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nGender roles.\n\n&gt;Perpetrators tend to be part of sexually violent all-male subcultures that normalize sexual conquests through violent pornography explicit images of rape as being acceptable, non-criminal, and the sign of male virility (Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002).\n\nAgain, unknowable and an emotion-twisting statement that doesn't deserve a place in a non-psychological report. Plus there's nothing wrong with rape porn as long as it isn't real. Rape erotica and animated rape are perfectly fine and let people let out their sexual desires safely.\n\n&gt;Approximately 11% of college women who experience rape report it to the police (Kilpatrick, et al., 2007).\n\nCan't find the source, would love to pick it apart. \n\n1/2\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411157201", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't know. I'm 25yo and kinda good-looking, not making that much money but I'm not poor, I'm not stupid either. I mean, I'm pretty average but getting into a relationship, or having sex, or whatever, is beyond my me. It's like, I skipped a class called \"interacting with the opposing sex and telling them that I have a penis 101\". Because sure I can talk to the ladies, I can hold a conversation on a lot of topics, or just be funny, even serious if needed, but I can't seem to comunicate that I want more from them without being labelled as a creep(not that I *really* tried but meh). It's like, nobody explained that shit to me and I'm too dumb to figure it out on my own. And at the same time, for the last few months/years, I've never felt so close to breaking my dry spell. \n\nI've never really been interested in girls before I was 23yo. I mean, sure I used to masturbate and stuff, but I never imagined myself with another girl. And now that I started taking care of myself, dressing better, having a nice hairstyle, being less shy, more social, I had for the first time in my life the idea of being with a woman. I kinda regret it since I'm unable to do so but at the same time, I'm happy it's not like that since many more years, because who knows how worse could be my mental state. Not that I'm depressed or anything, I'm just sad sometimes of still being alone you know.\n\nAlso, it's confusing because older women I work with flirt with me, compliment me, like I was a goddamn sex symbol when at the same time girls my age make sure to ignore me or consider me a friend at best. Lately at work, there's a new girl working with me that seemed to like me. A lot. By that I mean, pretty much everyone asked me if there's something going on between us. Because she always seem to talk about me, she always try to hang with me whenever possible. Stuff that could indicate she has a crush on me, anyway that's what everybody told me. Anyway, I learned that she has a boyfriend. Okay, whatever. Then she says: \"I wished TrueBro was my older brother\". You wot gurl? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Is there a \"family-zone\", beyond the friendzone? I mean, friendzone sucks but I can deal with it, but what the hell?\n\nAnyway, this went for too long and I need to get another beer. If you read through all of this, well, I hope it wasn't too boring. Sorry if it was.\n\nTLDR: I don't know.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411190365", "subreddit": "AskMen", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Whats the fukin matter, some1 steal ur sweetroll?\" he said to me. So I jumped up and did a 1276 backflip and karate kicked him in the chest, sending him flying back. He was able to hit me with a warhammer, sending me flying through a window. As I flew out the window, he jumped at me like a swan, gracefully using me as a jump pad. I was able to rise up and use a dragon shout on him. He flew into my car and shattered a window, as well as making my car alarm wail. I grabbed a bow from out of my trash can. It was rusted, but it had to do. I quickly fired an arrow at him, which didn't do much. The glass arrow shattered in to a million tiny pieces as it hit his chest plate of steel armor. He started going full rage mode, like a seven year old on xbox live, as he started to rapid fire arrows at me. This was no normal guard! The barrage of arrows hit me in various places, some whizzing by my head while others planting themselves in my unarmored flesh. I could only be killed if I was hit in one spot: the knee. Though I had been hit and badly harmed, I kept fighting. I let out a cry like that of a drauger being slain by a blade of fire and charged at the guard. The guard knew I could be slain with a single devastating blow to the knee, so he rushed me, dagger in hand and crazed look in his eyes. Right as we were about to clash, I leaped. Everything turned slo-mo as I flew over his head and we locked eyes. With my sword in hand, I sliced his head clean off. I landed with a roll as his headless body fell to the ground. As I started to go home, one little shit who was walking down the street called \"Hey, mister!\" I turned my head and saw he had found the guards bow. \"Cool toy!\" the little boy said. I started backing away. \"Kid, put that down! It's not a toy!\" I said nervously. Before I knew it, the kid had shot me directly in the knee. Bullseye! After that it was a daze. I woke up in a hospital bed, thankfully, it was only an iron arrow, and that little fucker didn't end me with that shot! There's the story of how I took an arrow to the knee.

{"body": "1)Really REALLY hope they give Sion a new Title name, instead of \"Undead Champion\". That title was awful and pointless (we can already tell he's undead and a champion). . . .shit, can he be Kingslayer? Anything else works that gives some more lore incite that isn't obvious on face value. \n\n2) I feel like the direction they are taking with this is that the citizens of Noxus will all be fully aware of Sion's resurrection, which is a TERRIBLE idea. I'm really hoping it's not, and that it's being done secretively by this General Darkwill character and his cronies (and Leblanc and her black rose lackeys are trying to find out about it). I hope that Katarina + Talon are her team is going to be against it, with the idea of resurrecting a hero to endlessly suffer in undeath just to be a machine as against Noxian beliefs of dying honorably (you know, like when you're actually defeated) and bravely.  Also, necromancy seems like chaotic dark magic that scarred the shadow isles which does not belong in a civilized place, even Noxus. They really need to stray from the old Demacia = good, Noxus = bad and give both places their wrongs/rights. Noxus shouldn't just be \"evil\" but a place that instills ideas of strength and bravery, sort of like Sparta, but those things also lead to elements of brutality (not just to foreign people, but to their own who are weak) as well as xenophobia (other people don't have same values so Noxians are superior). ALSO it would be really important, at least I think, to construct some differences in the Noxian lore related champs in terms of where they side in being sinister, cruel, and manipulative or being honorable Noxians. Eg. Katarina/Talon on the good true Noxian side of strength/honor/courage/blahblah and Swain being a shitty person who just wants to do anything to win. \ntl:dr : don't make all the citizens of Noxus be totally aware and complicit in necromancy, it's not good world building. \n\n3) ALL THE SIDE EYE to you folks who bitched about lore changes but couldn't even be sure that this was about Sion. I mean really . . . really? you don't get an opinion on lore based stuff when you can't get something this fookin' obvious.

{"body": "Let's say the next CoD comes out with multiplayer locked.  \nBut if you play singleplayer for 12 hrs you unlock it for free, or you can pay extra 20$.  \nThat would be pretty terrible deal, but for some reason it's okay in this game.\n\nI don't get how unlocking a 450 hero in Lol is slower than unlocking hero in Dawngate. Unlocking ALL heroes - yes, it is faster in Dawngate (In both ways).\n\nBut who was the ~~phone~~ owner ? Eul ? He already worked at Valve. Icefraud ? He was hired by Valve.   \nAlso, you cannot have \"rights\" to a mod. It is just not possible.\n\nI know the name is Riot, that's the joke and i did not say Dota moved from it, Dota was made before Lol.  \n\nSMITE god pack is a bad idea ? U wot m8 ? Is this real life ?  \nGod pack is probably the best model if you don't count Dota2.  \n\nAs for Strife, i don't see how game itself is related to anything, if we talk about business model.   \nI'm pretty sure devs there said that you will only play with people who have access to the same pets as you do, but don't quote me on that.\n\nDid you miss Rito being a GIANTHUGE studio bought out by FUCKINGGIANT Chinese company ? Rito is literally bigger than Valve. All of Valve. Riot bought esports. Or can you name tournaments with no involvement from them ?  \nHell, they actively try to stomp the alternatives. Because alternatives may play the game NOT how Rito wants it to be played.    \nThat's just what you can do, if you have infinite amount of money. Don't think EA will give out this amount of cash for Dawngate. \n\nJust as heroes, rune and talent system are numbers game. There is one right one for the hero, if you do things differently - you are playing hero at sub-optimal lvl. It's an illusion of customization without real depth behind it.   \n\nYes, imbalanced matches may happen in every game, but team winning with a giant handicap is not an imbalanced match.  \nWhy you can surrender if a person leaves ? Probably because it is a giant handicap..  \nIt's like if we play a fighting game and 1 player got a broken button on controller. There is something wrong with balance and/or skill of players involved, if handicapped player wins. You don't argue with math.\n\nIn this matter personal experience is irrelevant.  \nYou really do not understand how this genre works ? Playing vs stacks as pure random team will not teach you anything. you will not \"get better\". you either get stomped, because the stack actually plays to win. Or the stack will be stomped, because they are bad but mmr busted them. There is no skill involved in that.  \nIf stacks only play with stacks, the \"stack\" is just a variable, but it is equal for both teams.\n\nI never had 30 terrible games in a row.   \nAnd i did A-Z challenge in Dota (before it was a thing).\n\nThey can call it a \"Proof of concept\" for all i care.  \nTaking money openly (not \"founder's pack\" and \"early access\") - game is complete. Development is not stopped, sure, but the developer says that what's here is a product you can pay money for, not beta.  \nI'm pretty sure SMITE only sold god's pack during beta, if not then it is BS too.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411469359", "subreddit": "dawngate", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That's what I thought.\n\nI keep mentioning the content because when you consider the cost of the content, the stretch goals, and the circumstances around the Windows version, it doesn't make them look like assholes when they don't drop $50k on a Linux port. By the way, holy shit, $50k, are you serious? You're definitely delusional now, because that's way more than 50 times more than every Linux backer put together. When none of the funds went to the Windows version--and I don't know why I have to keep mentioning that--it makes YOU look like the asshole. *Especially* since we're just 1%. Why should we punish the other 99% of backers just because 1% is throwing a fit?\n\nThere is a massive disconnect between Linux gamers and every other gamer on what exactly the IGG was about. The reason the disconnect exist is Lab Zero's fault, but the fault now falls on Linux gamers for continuing to make demands after all the circumstances have been explained.\n\nAllow me to explain it one last time. If you tl;dr this, i swear on me mum i hit u in the gabber.\n\nMarvelous AQL **funded and developed the Windows version completely and entirely, and then continued to take all the profit from sales on Steam.** Just because the $30 included a Steam key doesn't mean any of that money went to working on the Windows version. Not even one cent of the IGG funds were devoted to developing the Windows version. Similarly, not one cent is being devoted to developing the PS4 and PSVita versions, as Sony paid for them too. So why, exactly, do we deserve to have the funds that were dedicated entirely to content reallocated for us when the other versions didn't get funded either?\n\nPart two: the cost of the content. Every fighter in Skullgirls is comprised of ~1300 frames of hand-drawn animation. And every single frame must be drawn, cleaned, shaded, colored, set up for color palettes, and rigged for the lighting engine. **Every single frame.** Every single frame is anti-aliased with detailed shading and very fluid animation. Compare to the pixelation, simple shading, and not particularly smooth animation of literally every other 2D sprite fighter out there. Like, in BBCP, they just keep a sprite on screen for a few more frames during animations. There are more individual sprites comprising an animation in Skullgirls.\n\nThen hire the professional voice actors like Erin Fitzgerald, Michelle Ruff, Lauren Landa, and Liam O'Brien. Then add in hitbox placement and testing. Every frame has a multitude of hitboxes; it's not just one big hitbox around the character. Each box covers each limb. Check it out in training mode sometime. Then configuration of hitstun, blockstun, pushback, and recovery frames on every move to create advantage and disadvantage. The fact that Filia's standing heavy punch is a mere 4 frames of disadvantage is kind of a huge deal and has a lot of implications on gameplay, not the least of which is that *nobody can punish her for doing it since there aren't any four-frame jabs with enough range.* Decisions like this aren't made lightly; you have to consider the kind of things you want people to be doing with that character, what kind of things you want other characters to do to that character, how assist characters should interact with it, how it should interact when used *as* an assist character...\n\nMaking a character for a fighting game is seriously hard. And the IGG has funded five: Squigly, Big Band, Eliza, Beowulf, and Robo-Fortune. Note that Squigly was partway through development and so didn't cost as much. And then add in the voice packs, which means bringing the VAs back to re-voice every move, and adding that functionality to the game.\n\nAnd this isn't a thing of where they made a lot of money and don't know what to do with it; these stretch goals were outlined! This was planned from the start!\n\nHow can you possibly assert that there is room in the budget for us, knowing all this? I seriously want to know. What, do you want them to cancel one of their stretch goals? \"Hey, remember that thing about us making Robo-Fortune? That's not happening anymore. The Linux version isn't out so we're reallocating funds from the IGG to get it done.\" Oh my god, could you even imagine how much ill will that would create?

Man, you must have been sobbing while reading that last comment I wrote in this thread. I took you apart and danced on the gore\n\nI had so much fun I’m going to do it again. And I have a right to bother you with this, day in and day out because, as you said, it’s an open forum on an open internet. We'll play by *your* rules now archie. If all this bothers you then that’s just too bad. \n\n&gt;Sorry, but you've still got it backwards. The LIA ended when tmeperatures had returned to pre-LIA levels. Sorry.\n\nYou’re the only one who thinks that’s true. So now your personal opinion counts as scientific evidence does it? Well done. \n\n&gt;No, it doesn't. \n\nWhat a snappy comeback. Did you stay up all night coming up with the perfect rebuttle?\n\n&gt;No, it was a personal attack.\n\nYou’re the only one who thinks so. I assume that you reported this supposed attack to the mods. Apparently they don’t agree with you.\n\n&gt;Except NASA doesn't back you, that's the point.\n\nRather than simply gainsaying you may want to try to look up the source: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Glossary/?xref=Little%20Ice%20Age\n\nShow me where NASA says anything different about the LIA. \n\n&gt;AGW has not been countered by any facts. That is a total fabrication on your part, and on this NASA certainly agrees with me.\n\nI provided a lin to the NASA site above. **I** don’t fabricate shit. **You** on the other hand fabricate shit like your reinterpretation of the LIA. \n\n&gt;AGW is not a cult, it's a scientific theory, one you still appear to fail to understand\n\nAdherence to a set of tenets is a cult. Adherence in the face of contradictory information makes for a *dangerous* cult because those people are nuts.\n\n&gt;That's not the cooling period I'm talking about. I'm talking about actual Milankovitch-driven climate change, on a scale much slower than the current warming or even the LIA.\n\nYou’re full of shit archie. That never came up in this thread. Now you’re just trying to back your way out of earlier statements. Give yourself an enema. You’ll feel better.\n\n&gt;I did not claim this. You need to work on your reading comprehension.\n\n**I said**\n\n- modern history records swings between cool and warm regimes lasting 3-500 years.\n\nTo which **You replied**\n\n- “Not really. We're on a (very slow) natural cooling trend,”\n\nThe only way that makes any sense is if you’re saying that the LIA did not end. On the one hand you’re arguing that the LIA ended some time before 1850, yet on the other hand you’re arguing against such an end. That’s insanity in action.\n\n&gt;Maybe if you eyeball graphs, but that's not good enough for me. Please provide peer-reviewed research to support your hypothesis. Thanks.\n\nIt’s *general knowledge* archie. The kind of general knowledge that one needs in speak intelligently on the topic of climate. If you don’t know those time periods then you’re incompetent to discuss the topic. \n\n&gt;You have to learn to let go, dude.\n\n**You wote this**\n\n- I only care when you post erroneous information about climate science on a few subreddits, and even then I only care about the arguments, not the person making them.\n\nMore BS archie. When you fail to get your way you get very personal. You leave off the argument and attack such things as 9/11 and V. Take a look at your first reply which includes:\n\n- Believe me, you'll tire long before I do.\n\nAnd yet here you are now saying: \n\n- No need to respond, we're done here and I'll ignored further replies from you on this thread. Have a nice day.\n\nSounds like you’re getting tired archie. At the top of the thread you’re a old nag in the starting gate determined to win but now you’re far behind and figure “what’s the use”. \n\n&gt;I'm sorry, but those are all lies. I'm not a pest, I stick to topics, I don't argue out of both sides of my mouth, I certainly don't create circular arguments, and I never, ever pass myself off as an expert.\n\n**LOL**. All the above has been rebutted by your performance in just this single thread. All of it’s true archie.\n\n&gt;You just want to post false claims about AGW theory and not have anyone challenge them.\n\nUntrue. I respond to all challenging comments, including your’s. I’d rather not respond to you because it’s a pointless exercise but the mods demand that I do. And in this case I’ve taken apart your objection to make you look foolish. Take a look – you’re the only person who responded. All the rest recognize a good argument when they see it but you can’t leave any of my comments alone. \n\n&gt;I don't keep a dossier on you. I have memory. I remember the fallacious positions you take.\n\nAnd I have a memory as well. So, when I remind you of your past comments you’ll do well to remember your position on this rather than deny having made the comment.\n\n&gt;Except I'm the one making you look foolish\n\nI’ve backed everything I’ve been talking about and rebutted everything you’ve written here. I’m the one making arguments based on facts while you’re the one offering up blogs and the products of your imagination. \n\n&gt;Your reputation as a believer of junk science is pretty much well-established by now.\n\nWhich is more evidence that you care deeply about the person rather than the argument being presented. When I say that you’re two-faced I have a very strong case.\n\n&gt;I don't have any mods in my pocket, and I didn't ask for a thread to be removed. I guess the mods are getting as tired of your arrogant, ignorant BS as I am.\n\nSo why do you make threats to have my comments removed if you don’t feel that you have the power to do so? \n\nIn my last exchange with one of the mods he made it clear that he’s sick of **both** of us. Which is why, I suppose, that the entire thread was removed.\n\nSee you tomorrow archie! I know that I’ll see you here again because you can’t help yourself.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411486305", "subreddit": "environment", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Night terrors. That’s what the doctors called them. If only those close to me could understand the lunacy in this diagnosis, or at bar minimum the insufficiency of it. You see, when it started even I thought of it as a few nightmares gone too far. I would wake in the dark of night without a strong command of what had happened. My heart would be racing. I would be covered in sweat. I would have several fragmented parts of a story, an experience, but for the life of me I couldn’t put them together. \n\nI wish I hadn’t learned how.\n\nAfter about a month, the doctor sent me to a sleep specialist. This guy was a real piece of work, let me tell you. He helped me realize that these dreams were “an outward reflection of the lack of peace held within” and to find resolve I would have to “search the depths of my mind and soul”. What a crock of shit. All that quack really taught me was dream recall, and now that I’ve learned how to remember these dreams, there’s no turning back.\n\nFor the past three months and twelve days, I have knowingly been living my neighbor Carl’s life in my dreams. I’m not sure I have control over Carl’s actions, but I’m definitely there, seeing things from Carl’s perspective. If this wasn’t looney enough, these dreams are typically manifesting as Carl three weeks in the future. \n\nHow do I know? Maybe because I knew what Carl was going to wear to work this morning. I knew he was going to eat scrambled eggs and Texas toast with the crust cut off for breakfast. I knew he was going be seven minutes late to work and tonight he is going to leave work two and a half hours late. I’m positive of that. I dreamt it. \n\nI know tomorrow he is going to get a promotion at that small, pitiful insurance company he works for. I know next week he is going to get in a fender-bender on his drive back from Lake Louise. And three weeks from today he is going to fuck my girlfriend in his rental car while I’m browsing the internet before bed. \n\nCarl’s isn’t the only life I am living in my dreams. Some nights I faintly recall the life of a woman living in 2028, 14 years in the future. She is an okay broad, as far as heroin addicts go. On rare occasion, I am living as a Corporal Wilson fighting a war TBD. \n\nI didn’t ask for this and I'm not entirely sure what to make of it all yet. I don't know who I can come forward to or who would even believe me. I'm guessing I'll need to predict some absolutely unbelievable shit from the future before anyone truly believes me. All I know is this is the hand I've been dealt. As Carl’s mother always says,” ’tis life.” \n\nThat cheeky british cunt.\n   \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411496503", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The impressions I have so far run a little like this:\n\nBlackwall: almost like a male Wynne archetype. A stoic dude who will respect you if you respect him. Kind of fanatically devoted to the noble Grey Wardens but in a good way.\n\nCole: Probably a spirit of Empathy or Mercy, though maybe a demon depending on how you play. Having read asunder, he'll probably be much the same - kind of emotional and concerned with others' feelings, maybe to the detriment of the long term success of the Inquisition.\n\nBull: All round affable lad. Will fucking kill you if you're going to stop him doing what he thinks is right. Or fun. I can see sarcastic or light hearted inquisitors getting on with him *very* well. Probably will butt heads with you if you can't be flexible about things he thinks are trivial. Like 'which race you belong to' or 'which faction you fight for'.\n\nCassandra: we know her pretty well. Hard Edged, sharp tempered, a professional badass and all about getting the job done. She'll have the opposite attitude to Cole about the long term benefits of short term misery. I think she'll be a tough nut to open up, but she's kind and decent on the inside.\n\nDorian: A gentlemanly rapscallion. I imagine him being snarky and sarcastic, but never outright cruel. He seems like it's hard to make him mad.\n\nSolas: I think Solas is going to be a weird guy. Maybe a little bit Hardcore pro-elf. You might find it difficult to get along with him if you aren't a supporter of Mages. A scholar, though, so there'll probably be a lot of room for disagreement without him getting super mad at you.\n\nVivienne: snooty, but happy as long as it's clear she's got the biggest boots. She's quite pro-circle, so she might even favor siding with Templars. I bet she hates Anders. Getting along with her will probably be easier than a lot of people think as long as you don't mind hearing about how awesome she is.\n\nVarric: well, we know Varric, but there's an implication he's not the same Dwarf we knew. I have a feeling it's going to be hard to please Varric. He'll be the opposite of Cassandra: easygoing and friendly on the surface, but maybe cold stone on the inside. His time in Thedas hasn't been all that happy. Maybe Cole will try to cheer him up.\n\nSera: she's the larrikin, but I bet she's also an all or nothing kind of character who will be your best friend *ever* or think you're a total ass, depending on how much you sync up with her worldview. I think she's supposed to be a chav. Chavs are polarizing kinds of characters. (U wot m8?)\n\nI think it's going to be easiest to get along with Bull, Varric and Dorian. They're outwardly friendly from what we know. The others will be harder, depending on how you play or what you can stand in a character. \n\nCole might need coddling, for instance. He's a child in a man's body, and emotion is his stock in trade. A lot of people will instantly write that off as 'whining' and ignore him. Vivienne might need to be appeased and have her ego stroked, which a lot of players will resent, and label her too arrogant to bother with.\n\nAll just impressions, of course, it could be the complete opposite of all this.

{"body": "I was lucky enough to get the game a few days ago, and I've just passed the 25 hour mark.\n\nIt's absolutely fantastic. I went into the game expecting an enjoyable -- if average -- experience, but god damn if I haven't been blown away by the sheer amount of content and obvious love for the Zelda franchise that has been crammed into this game. \n\nNot only does every single character feel totally unique, the different weapons you collect completely change how the characters play on the battlefield and how they interact with enemies -- complete with unique battle and victory animations. \n\nLegend mode is a lot of fun, with a surprisingly solid story and great scenarios -- the final battle is actually one of the best in any game you can hope to play, not to mention the huge amount of replay value with different difficulty settings, Characters, Gold skulltulas and heart pieces to collect on subsequent playthroughs. \n\nAnd THEN there's Adventure mode. I've sunk about ten hours into this bad boy already and am No where even to the half way mark. A huge variety of challenges and gameplay elements that aren't even in the \"main\" game. Not to mention the pile of new unlockables that are available; all in a wonderful retro Zelda skin. Awesome. \n\nHaven't even got around to challenge mode yet. \n\nAnd the Music. OH MY GOD THE MUSIC. \nSeriously, the best soundtrack I've heard since Super Smash Bros Brawl -- a few of my favorites:\n\n[Solidus Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNyMNp6n0-4)\n\n[Skyloft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSx15zoUshs)\n\n[Eclipse of the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQxoJtNZLig)\n\nIt's fookin fantastic is what I'm saying. Honestly, the only criticism I can think of at the moment is the rather lame multiplayer offering --  Graphical quality is sacrificed to a awful degree to maintain a decent framrate and it really takes away from the experience. \n\n\n10", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411766742", "subreddit": "zelda", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Jolly good show, mate! I had a great time playing the GoldenSpy playlist. You've done a great job on these 4 missions, I can tell you've put in a lot of work!\n\nThe playlist as a whole, is great. The story flows along perfectly, I never had an instance where I wasn't sure what was going on, nor did I find anything was out-of-place from mission to mission. This is integral for making a playlist, and you've done it.\n\nEach map has a good description of what you're doing, why you're doing it, and also keeps the story flowing along. Well done with that. You really must have been watching a lot of 007, because I felt like I was playing a James Bond playlist even before I had read that's what you were going for. So great job there, too. Right on the money.\n\n**Fort Rusty with Love** - A small, but greatly mapped out capture mission. I loved this mission, and bookmarked it right away. *(I couldn't contain myself waiting for the bookmark button to show up, I just had to have this mission).* This mission is **highly tactical** and playing with you and your mates was probably one of the most organized missions I've ever accomplished.\n\nProp placement here was impressive. Your tower is absolute genius. The double decker base camps are also really well thought out. You just happened to find a great area to build this exact map in. Wow.\n\nI really like how this mission played out. Climbing the tower presents just enough of a challenge that enemies have time to catch up. Enemies don't know if you're climbing or waiting to ambush them. Challenge: Don't get shot running up to the tower, or on the second and third floor. The pay-off? **A ROCKET LAUNCHER** oh, *and the mission objective...* The tactical exit at the top of the tower sold me on this mission. If I had died on my fall, I knew you were there for the package. *I jumped, and you all just said \"run, run, run\" and I had scored the first point.* Fookin' love this mission.\n\nThe weapons are perfect. Don't change ANYTHING.\n\n10/10 and one of my new favourite maps. It also does help that I've wanted to make a mission like this. You beat me to the punch, and you did a better job at it than when I tried.\n\n**SkyBrawl - EDIT:** This mission was the most difficult, but when our team had figured out a good strategy it was pretty great! The problem with this map isn't with anything you've done wrong, it's with the mechanics of the helicopter mini-guns. That being said, once we played this playlist for the second time I had a lot better go of it.\n\n**How I enjoyed this capture most:**\n\n* Clear weather\n\n* A good team with solid communication - Second time playing was awesome\n\n* Although we never tried it, I would have liked to play this mission on Sudden Death.\n\n* The players should try their best to blow up NPC choppers over the roof - then have one team member land and get the package while the other team mate provides cover.\n\n* Pick up your team mate from the roof for a fast extraction. Good-To-Go!\n\nMy personal rating, 7/10 - 8/10 once I had a good strategy down-pat.\n\n**You Only Live Fast - EDIT** - **CRAZY** - **ACTION PACKED** - **INSANITY!!**\nThis race is F***ING awesome. ~~Use zones to stop ambient vehicles in the first section (up to that first jump) like you had said. It's just a little too narrow.~~(Can't do this in Race Creator) Then add a stunt jump to that jump so you get that cool camera effect, and it will get verified FOR SURE. \n\nIf I were going to change any checkpoints, it wouldn't be much. I would bring CP 36 back just a touch, I drove through the orchard twice, oops. After you bring back CP 36, add another one (or two) between there and 37, because I also drove through the other side.. Basically both of those long curves have areas that look like they just might be shortcuts.. but they're not, really.\n\nI bookmarked this race 'sharpish' as you would say, 'cause again I didn't want to lose a chance to play it. I think there was 6 of us in the playlist for this race - it was one hell of a brawl. This mission is the epitome of what a bond-playlist car-chase should be. The playlist would have been incomplete without it. \n\nThis is just awesome. You have the perfect description of why on earth cars would be shooting rockets out of them, they're 00 cars. Duh. I've never liked GTA races because I have trouble coming up with a reason behind them. You were quite clever to use those exact cars in this exact playlist. How fitting, you lucky jerkwad. I only say that out of love, and jealousy because you were the first one to do a bond playlist. **Dude, this race is a 10/10 in my books. This race makes me want to bump down all the other races I've played a notch.** - I know I'll be seeing this mission get verified.\n\n**The Spy Who Sniped Me** - Okay, well this is going to be biased because I'll be rating you basically next to my DM which is on the same island. Obviously they're quite comparable. We have pretty-well the same layout, and same vehicles. We both used dynamic props in the same way, but one thing differs between us.\n\n* My map has a tower in the middle of it to snipe the outside edges of the island.\n* Your map has jet skis to snipe from farther islands.\n\nAlthough I do like the idea of being able to snipe from farther islands, GTA5 isn't ready for this concept yet. When you put those jet skis in the map, you've gone and invited noobs to get one kill ahead out of dumb luck and make a run for it. They can totally escape and you won't be able to catch them. Once GTA5 gives us the power to determine when you've gone \"out-of-range\" for the map, I'd say this is great. Until then, I'm scared to play your mission with fewer than 4 people.\n\nProp placement, Gun and Vehicle placement, all very well done.\n\nSniping Opportunity on the island is high, well done.\n\nAdding to the story? Absolutely. When I read the description of what's going on at the island I laughed out loud. This is a great conclusion to the playlist, and even though you beat me 30 kills to 8, I still had a good time playing with you and your mates.\n\n7/10 on this map for jet skis, and I feel like you could have used a more interesting area for your map. Your prop placement was great, but there is a lack of a natural setting that the rest of your missions seemed to use for atmosphere. Also there is a lot of health and armor put down. but a lack of other weapons. AP pistols were running out of ammo, maybe put a few extra down.\n\nOnce again I'll say your playlist really comes together nicely. I had a great time playing it with you guys. Invite me back any time, you and your buddies are good guys to play with and it's nice to get some numbers in these missions.\n\nOver all I was very impressed. On average, 8.5 for the total playlist. That's not too bad. I didn't know how hard I was supposed to judge, but I did pay attention to a lot of different details. Great job Tim.\n\n- Neo (Dylan)\n\n**TL;DR - Awesome playlist, 8.5/10 - Great story line and individual missions. You need to check this out!!**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411916877", "subreddit": "GTAContent", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To piggyback on what /u/MinibearRex said: I noticed that oftentimes when people ask why, it's so they can then argue the reasons and immediately make a second attempt at asking out.  To make a very crude example:\n\n\"Will you go out with me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Your breath's terrible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll just use Listerine, no problem!\"\n\n...And once reasons are stated, they can be rebuked, and the issue drags on and on until you've said no a dozen times over, or somehow the \"studious kind of nerdy wine-drinking guy who loves action movies\" implicitly vowed to become a \"marathon-running fit guy who swore off alcohol and who loves stand-up comedy with a passion\"... for **you**.  (Cue in a very appropriate \"u wot m8?\")\n\nBut the thing is that it generally goes beyond a mere dealbreaker.  It's really because there isn't a *spark*.  That age-old \"I'm just not *feeling* it\" that nobody can really put in words but that most of us implicitly understand.  You've had time to think about the latest FB message or the SMS asking the dreaded 'why?' question, easy enough, OK.  Now try this out in public, you're in front of your approacher - you have five seconds!  Ho-ho!\n\nAs much as it seems like a snap decision, usually in doubt, people will not want to invest themselves.  Given the choice between \"maybe missing the train\" and \"committing oneself to potential trouble\", the former almost always wins.  Reasons can be as simple as basic lack of compatibility and there's nothing either party can do about it.  Great friends, yes.  Lovers, no.\n\nI think openly stated dealbreakers are a miracle of God and they're told of only if they're perceived as readily fixable.  \"Yes I want to, but please do ______ first.\"  Otherwise reasons for rejection can both be compounded and very broad, and it's not by altering one issue that it'll change the deal at the end of the day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412010169", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}
