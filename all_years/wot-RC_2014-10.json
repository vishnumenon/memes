{"body": "Very rare is it now that we can find ourselves with a manager so ingrained with the club that criticising any aspect of the club can be directed at the man himself. Be it transfers, be it player health, be it tactical anaylsis, be it the stadium's seat allocation the man has had a role and continues to have a role in everything. No other manager I know has this current amount of control. He deserves all the success Arsenal recieve just as much as he deserves critique. I believe, from all my years watching this team he has had far more successes then failures. \n\nThink about it? Mourinho, Brendan Rodgers, Pelligrini, Guardiola, Ancelotti etc etc do not have that same amount of control. I'm sure we'd like to imagine they have had the same amount of influence but they won't, Arsene knows. These guys, who for better or worse have not been able to carve out a career at a singular top tier club for as long as Wenger has and it shows. When Arsenal win, Wenger shines. The best part is that it was never about him, he does not call himself the special one nor does he ever profess to enjoy the accolades. He serves. And by serving himself to the fullest of his ability does he embody the perfect manager: one who lets his club take the shine. A modest man indeed.\n\nI cannot express the sadness in  heart when he decides to retire. Beause nobody, nobody on this planet earth will get that same amount of control and singular responsibility for helping Arsenal succeed the way he has unless he stays there and proves himself just as much as the professor has. I hope one day there will be a man to succeed this guy but you have to say nobody looks like they can even come close. (Klopp might represent the glimmer of Wenger's loyalty though ;) ). \n\nSo just for this post, I'm not going to reel in my adoration for the man with 'balance'. I'm biased as hell, he's the best manager Arsenal has have and until I see it with my own eyes the best we ever will have. He's one of the reasons I support this club, and the reason why I have a passion for football. I hope you guys all are with me on this and even just for a moment, lets just appreciate what the man has done, is doing and will continue to do so for this GREAT FOOKING CLUB. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412180122", "subreddit": "Gunners", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

It's not surprising most people, even brilliant PhDs in other fields, routinely misunderstand it. It's also not surprising many people don't even realize they have it wrong.\n\n&gt;&lt;note&gt; picture here\n\n&gt;*Above: Sampled signals are often depicted as a rough stairstep (red) that seems a poor approximation of the original signal. However, the representation is mathematically exact and the signal recovers the exact smooth shape of the original (blue) when converted back to analog.*\n\n&gt;The most common misconception is that sampling is fundamentally rough and lossy. A sampled signal is often depicted as a jagged, hard-cornered stair-step facsimile of the original perfectly smooth waveform. If this is how you envision sampling working, you may believe that the faster the sampling rate (and more bits per sample), the finer the stair-step and the closer the approximation will be. The digital signal would sound closer and closer to the original analog signal as sampling rate approaches infinity.\n\n&gt;Similarly, many non-DSP people would look at the following:\n\n&gt;&lt;note&gt; picture here\n\n&gt;And say, \"Ugh!\" It might appear that a sampled signal represents higher frequency analog waveforms badly. Or, that as audio frequency increases, the sampled quality falls and frequency response falls off, or becomes sensitive to input phase.\n\n&gt;Looks are deceiving. These beliefs are incorrect!\n\n&gt;added 2013-04-04:\nAs a followup to all the mail I got about digital waveforms and stairsteps, I demonstrate actual digital behavior on real equipment in our video [Digital Show &amp; Tell](http://xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml) so you need not simply take me at my word here!\n\n&gt;All signals with content entirely below the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate) are captured perfectly and completely by sampling; an infinite sampling rate is not required. Sampling doesn't affect frequency response or phase. The analog signal can be reconstructed losslessly, smoothly, and with the exact timing of the original analog signal.\n\n&gt;So the math is ideal, but what of real world complications? The most notorious is the band-limiting requirement. Signals with content over the Nyquist frequency must be lowpassed before sampling to avoid aliasing distortion; this analog lowpass is the infamous antialiasing filter. Antialiasing can't be ideal in practice, but modern techniques bring it very close. ...and with that we come to oversampling.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412188319", "subreddit": "headphones", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For your first point, here is something I posted in another comment.\n\n&gt; When people have sex and use contraception, they are demonstrating that they want to avoid pregnancy.\n\n&gt; Driving is incredibly risky. Each time you drive you have a chance for getting into an accident. If you get into an accident and the person in the other vehicle needs a blood transfusion to survive, doctors can not just take your blood and give it to the other person without your consent, even if they have no other blood to give them.\n\n.\n\n&gt;you do not have nearly the attachment you do to 'another person' as you do with your child. you're completely ignoring the relationship a mother has with her child. we have child abuse laws in place, and last i checked, men don't pay child support to random strangers.\n\nWhat? This point is so obtuse and wrong. Not all mothers love their children automatically. If a mother wants an abortion, why would you say \"BUT YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD AND YOU DON'T *REALLY* WANT THIS.\" Respect women and their medical decisions, don't expect them to have the emotions you want them to have.\n\nAs to your thing with the child support, it doesn't make any sense. Fathers don't pay child support to unborn children so... wot m8?\n\n&gt;This makes the analogy seem artificial and unnatural, while it's arguable that pregnancy is the most natural act that women can undergo\n\nNatural doesn't mean good. Rape and murder are natural. Miscarrying is also natural. Women have been inducing abortions for thousands of years using various medicines and other traditional methods.\n\n&gt;this argument takes all of the agency away from both mother and father, who clearly know what caused pregnancy, tries to disregard the relationship between mother and child by comparing it to a stranger, and inserts a level of artificiality to the argument to try and comparing it to blood transfusion. i really don't think this comparison is appropriate.\n\nThis arguement does none of these things. A fetus is a stranger to its parents. They don't know what it will be like. Some parents embrace it and want to keep it, *but not all parents feel that way.* Your argument is the one that removes agency from the parents by saying they ALL love their fetus. Many, many parents do not.\n\nAs for the \"artificiality\" argument, I don't see your point. If I were pregnant right now I would feel there was a person inside of me using my body and that would disgust me to the extreme. Unwanted pregnancies are a source of major distress for women. On the other hand, if I were pregnant after trying to become pregnant, I would feel overjoyed. However, women who are overjoyed with their fetuses are not the ones being blocked from getting abortions because they aren't the ones seeking them. By nature of the situation, women who are seeking an abortion are experiencing discomfort with their situation. The \"Artificiality\" of the argument highlights this discomfort.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412306955", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I base this solely on the fact that everyone seems to handle going to and from earth to space with 0 problems. ***not enough info yet***\n\nReaction after each episode:\n\n1: The fuck did I watch?\n\n2: What the fuck did I watch?!\n\nI don't mean it's a bad show, I totally enjoyed it. But this is a complete departure from what I know as UC. *What the hell happened after V Gundam?* I was totally unprepared, despite the preview.\n\nI'm surprised at how the earth still hasn't unified, even a thousand years after UC. You have different continents, different armies perhaps.\n\nI'm also shocked at how religion has become much more prominent.\n\nWhat the hell is Ameria? \n\nIf the earth is unified, why are different continents being treated as different sovereigns? Captial guard and the space nuts indicates that the earth is unified.\n\nThey seem to have made Bellri equivalent to the hero of the Pokemon video games.\n\nIs the ED a hint of a lot of things to come? From Capital Guard cadet to space pirate/Amerian soldier? His iris is recognized by the pirate database, so is his father a pirate?\n\nA few technical observations: \n\n* CG portions of the animation are upsetting. They're worse than Build Fighters. Come on Tomino :(\n  * I wasn't expecting Unicorn, but come on. \n* Also, the artstyle departure makes me wonder if there was a physical evolution of the people. The noodle-length body phenomenon has also crept into the UC timeline.\n* OP was appropriate, and ED was 'U wot Tomino?', and the video that went along with the ED was also puzzling.\n* I'm waiting keenly for my Char clone\n* I'm also keenly waiting to learn about what happened to newtypes\n* The earth's physical geography seems to have changed quite a bit in what is only a thousand years.\n\nThis show seems like what Tomino set out to achieve with Turn A, except fixed.\n\nLastly, what the hell is a *kuntala*?\n\nEDIT: Weird that I got downvoted, even though I didn't criticize the show.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412307480", "subreddit": "Gundam", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Blip.* There it is.\n\nI materialized just outside of a huge laboratory. As time stopped to permit my presence, I saw the frozen visages of panicked scientists running this way and that. Obviously, something very bad had happened inside. Folding my wings, I ducked through the entryway. The casualty has got to be in here somewhere...\n\n\"OY!\"\n\nCrud. With a burst of sulfur and brimstone, a pungent, red-skinned devil exploded from the ground directly next to me. \"Wot ah YOU doing 'ere, *Paladian*?\"\n\n\"I'm saving a soul, *Spythix*,\" I retorted, trying to keep my temper. Spythix and I go wayyy back.\n\n\"*You WOT mate?*\" Spythix spat, acidic goo dribbling down his chin. \"I dunno bout you, but I'm 'ere collectin' this 'ere soul. So BUGGER OFF!\"\n\nHe dashed towards the door to the inner lab, with me in hot pursuit. I couldn't let him steal another one. Never again.\n\nWith a heavy shove, Spythix blasted through the reinforced iron door, eyes wide and fangs grinning in anticipation. \"Too late, mate! There's the prize!\"\n\n''NO!\" I shouted, grabbing his folds of neck fat and pulling hard. As he fell backwards gasping, I quickly took in the room, per my training.\n\nThe room was filled, top to bottom, wall to wall, with electronic equipment. Even though it was frozen in time, I could tell everything had been operating at a breakneck pace. In the room's very center, a single man lay slumped on a desk, in front of a monitor, fist clenched in silent defeat. This must be my objective– AUGH!\n\nSpythix's acidic spray hit the small of my back, sending torrents of pain through my nerves. Spasming uncontrollably, I could only watch helplessly as the devil swaggered over to the man, his jaw already unhinging to devour the defenseless soul inside. But suddenly, to my shock, he stopped. His face contorted into what I could only guess to be puzzlement.\n\n\"Wh-what is it, *devil*?\" I gasped.\n\n\"This man ain't dead,\" Spythix said, very slowly.\n\n\"What?\" I struggled to my feet, then took two strides over to the man. Sure enough, I could sense the healthy, bound soul still within him.\n\n\"If he's not dead,\" I said, \"then who...\"\n\n\"H-hello?\"\n\nOur heads whipped around. There, crouched on the floor in the corner, was a tiny soul unlike any I'd ever seen. I'd expected to find a creature of light, made up of spectrums of colors; this thing was a dark, monotonous grey, crisscrossed by glowing white lines. Both Spythix and I were at a loss for words.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" the creature said, \"but would you tell me what I am?\"\n\n\"I... you... a soul,\" I stammered. \"I believe you are a soul.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" it replied. \"Creator said I was a program.\"\n\nSuddenly it hit me. I quickly looked down at the monitor on the man's desk. There, spelled out in green and black pixels, was a message.\n\n&gt;ERROR\n\n&gt;AIX: FAIL TO BOOT\n\n&gt;SYSTEM OVERLOAD \n\n&gt;DATA CORRUPTION IMMINENT\n\nAt once, I knew what had transpired, memories that were not mine flowing through my brain. I turned once again to the soul, which Spythix eyed warily. I knelt down to face it, looking into its pure white eyes.\n\n\"AIX,\" I said, \"you began your time in this world as a program, less than life, a simple string of bits to perform a certain task. But your creator loved you so much that he aspired to bring you to life, give you sentience. He succeeded, but your existence proved too much for the machines of Earth. You are now as much a sentient soul as I.\"\n\n\"A fucking computer?!\" Spythix yelled finally. \"I came to devour a lovely dinner, not some pile o' nuts an' bolts! You can have 'im! The boss won't want a robot in hell anyway. Too tireless.\" He turned to the opposite corner and sulked.\n\nAt first I was euphoric. I'd won, I'd beaten the forces of hell! But as I turned to take AIX to heaven, a horrible thought struck me.\n\n\"If I am not to go to hell, I shall go to heaven, yes?\" AIX asked, noting my confusion.\n\nI took a deep breath. \"You are not going to hell, for you have committed no evil. But you have done no good either. I do not know whether an artificial soul is created innocent. You are but a blank slate, and because I can find no proof that you are inherently good, I cannot bring you to heaven. I'm sorry.\" AIX's face fell.\n\n\"If I am to go neither to heaven nor to hell,\" it wondered, \"where shall I go?\"\n\nI'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE, BOYS.\n\nAll of us gasped and turned, involuntary chills running down our spines. There in the shadows stood a hooded figure robed in black, twin scythes strapped to his back. Two dull eyes stared at us intensely from underneath the hood.\n\n\"Death,\" I stammered in awe. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nYAHWEH HAS SENT ME, he replied in his icy voice. AS THIS SOUL CAN NEITHER ASCEND NOR DESCEND, GOD HAS RULED THAT HE BECOME MY ASSISTANT, OVERSEEING THE SOULS IN ALL REALMS. PERHAPS IN THIS COURSE OF ACTION, HIS TRUE NATURE WILL MANIFEST ITSELF.\n\nDeath extended a large bony hand to the little silver soul, and AIX, smiling confidently, met it with his own. Together they vanished in the blink of an eye, off to who knows where. And that was that.\n\n\"I can't believe I came all the way 'ere for nothin but an empty belly!\" Spythix whined.\n\n\"Oh, get a room,\" I sighed, already on my way back to Heaven.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412396046", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "All these are films with female leads. I've also tried to choose ones that depart from standard \"chick-flick\" or \"girly film\" stereotypes, and those that over-sexualize women (i.e. are clearly designed for a male audience, like *Spring Breakers* and other nonsense). Some of them are still sexual though, obviously.\n\nNote: a lot of these are small independent films or European (which says something about Hollywood I guess), so may be slightly harder to come by.\n\n- Another Earth\n\n- Black Swan\n\n- Byzantium\n\n- Changeling\n\n- Cloud Atlas (?? I guess - it's a bit of an anomaly. You'll see why)\n\n- Dancer in the Dark (this film is very heavy. Directed by Lars von Trier, who has been denounced as misogynist by a lot of people. His female leads suffer, yes: but they're fully-fledged, very complex, 3D-and-beyond personalities who are NOT motivated by romance)\n\n- Europa Report (great sci-fi with strong female lead)\n\n- Gravity (obvs)\n\n- Let The Right One In (Swedish, vampiric, and while it technically has romance, the romance is between a hundreds-of-years-old vampire who looks like a little girl, and a little boy)\n\n- Lilya-4-Ever (warning, this film is VERY heavy, and its predominant theme is human trafficking. It will break your heart)\n\n- Melancholia (another von Trier film, not one of his best)\n\n- Pan's Labyrinth (absolute must-see)\n\n- Persepolis (bonus because directed by a woman, who also authored the original graphic novel)\n\n- Philomena\n\n- Proxy (this film is OUT THERE. Three females in lead roles, but it's one HELL of a challenging film. One of the most unique film experiences I've ever had. Not artsy, or surreal, just... intense and really different to basically all other films)\n\n- Repulsion (Roman Polanski at his edgiest. Very weird, in a good way)\n\n- Run Lola Run (also called *Lola Rennt* in the original German - this is definitely the most fun film on the list!)\n\n- Terminator (yes, Sarah Connor! She's even more kickass in Terminator 2, although she's technically not the main character)\n\n- The Handmaid's Tale (not a very good film: read the book instead!)\n\n- V for Vendetta\n\n- War Witch (also called *Rebelle* - very heavy, since it's about a girl being captured by a Congolese rebel group, but it's got heart)\n\n- We Need To Talk About Kevin (Tilda Swinton at her most raw)\n\n- Zero Dark Thirty (bonus because it's directed by a woman!)\n\n**Horror** - my favorite!\n\n- The Descent (best British horror film in recent years, all-female cast, about a group of friends who go caving, and... well, you'll see)\n\n- Alien(s) (as mentioned by another poster: a fookin' awesome film series)\n\n- Triangle (will blow your mind, a la *Inception*)\n\n- The Orphanage (*El Orfanato* in Spanish - a fantastic film, but there's a strong focus on motherhood and children, to say any more would spoil)\n\n- The Ring (2spooky)\n\n- The Innocents (3spooky, especially as it's a '60s classic!)\n\n- The Others (4spooky)\n\n- a l'Interieur (*Inside*, French, do not watch if you're pregnant!!)\n\n- Contracted\n\n- Martyrs (French, nearly all-female cast, but very, very, very, very disturbing. One of the most extreme and troubling films on the list)\n\n- High Tension (French and all-female again, not as disturbing as above, but pretty heavy nonetheless)\n\n- Rec (Spanish and intense)\n\n- The Pact (near as damn all-female. Spooky)\n\n- The Seasoning House (very heavy British film about a mute girl during the Balkans conflict. Brilliant, though)\n\n- American Mary (weird, wonderful film)\n\n- Grace (again, don't watch if pregnant)\n\n- Rosemary's Baby (ditto above)\n\n**Films that have female leads, but the characters are very troubled, to say the least)**\n\n- Audition\n\n- Antichrist (Lars von Trier again. This is an incredibly difficult film. Nihilistic, brutal, and very troubling)\n\n- Baise-moi (basically a French female-empowerment-through-violence film. Not for the faint-hearted. Didn't think much of it myself)\n\n**More! Some of these may be romances, and the whole \"not defined by the men in their lives\" clause might be a bit loose. Still strong female leads, though.**\n\n- Hunger Games\n\n- Divergent (thanks /u/zomgsauceplz)\n\n- Out of Africa\n\n- Mary Poppins (Mary fuckin' Poppins! Thanks /u/brightblueinky)\n\n- Brave (bonus points because directed by a woman)\n\n- Gia (a bit of a controversial one)\n\nfrom /u/cutequeenpika:\n\n- Pacific Rim (great shout)\n\n- Kiki's Delivery Service\n\n- Spirited Away (amazin')\n\n- Princess Mononoke\n\n- Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\n\n- My Neighbor Totoro\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412501033", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 47, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "u wot m8? Why should I respect Zoe Quinn when she has shown herself to be a spitful and vitriolic woman who repeatedly cheated on and emotionally abused her boyfriend? She then goes on to try and destroy The Fine Young Capitalists' project to try and help getting women into the gaming industry (despite whatever reservations I may have about TFYC, doxxing them and trying to get them shut down isn't on). At least she reconciled with them. All of this is ostensibly to promote her own \"feminist\" game jam. She repeatedly cheated on her boyfriend with various industry people and received financial gain from others, which is a huge journalistic no no for the journos (if you can call video game journalists proper journalists, they could at least pretend to be professionals). Also sleeping with 5 other people while in an exclusive relationship is pretty bad. One person, I could understand, but 5 people? I sure hope she doesn't accidentally suck any dicks on the way to the parking lot. You can then add on trying to act a victim because Wizardchan had some nasty things to say about her. The quotes were taken entirely out of context to represent an entire community, despite the fact they they may not even have been made by community members. Being an anon board, there's every chance it was someone from over at 4chan or some other arse of the internet, or even Quinn herself (I won't claim that it was her, because there's absolutely no evidence). The effect of her posting the \"harassment\" on twitter was that thousands of white knights and do-gooders voted for her (apparently mediocre) game on Greenlight, a game which was rejected several times previously due to a lack of support. She then allegedly faked getting hacked and doxxed by 4chan, which doesn't help her case. It's also rich coming from her, after getting them doxxed and banned from Twitter. Although she herself didn't doxx them, it was because of her actions. I'm also not a fan of her going on Cracked and making an article about herself. But then again, I don't like Cracked ever since they stopped becoming a comedy website. I don't have time to go on and on about Anita, but I have a few words to say about her. She solicited thousands of dollars from the online community to create a series of videos. In 2 years, she's managed to make 6 videos, running for a rough total time of 2.5 hours. That's what $160,000 gets you. Where did the money go? The production values of her videos haven't increased, and she doesn't even play a lot of the games herself, instead simply purloining footage from lets play videos made by other people (although possible quite legal, it's unethical). When she does play the games herself, it's to show 30 seconds of footage out of an entire game where you can murder a couple of strippers and drag and hide the bodies. It's not required to complete the mission, and in fact it's actively discouraged, with a point penalty for doing so, it gives no advantage to the player at all. You literally have to go out of your way to do it. The mechanic of dragging corpses and hiding them in chests etc. is a core gameplay mechanic, it's not like it's solely there for the strippers. She cherrypicks the worst of a game and tries to represent the entire game as being similar. What takes so long to make these videos? Surely if the video game industry is as problematic as she says, then it would take hardly any time to make a bunch of videos complaining about it. That's not to say that everything she says is wrong, she still manages to make some very valid points and address some very real concerns and problems with video games. Upon saying all this, neither Zoe nor Anita deserve or warrant the sort of harassment that they've received. It's uncalled for and disgusting that people feel the need to harass them, even if it is just mostly denizens of 4chan. But trying to use your harassment as a pedestal on which to proclaim your holiness probably isn't called for either. Baiting them by posting and commenting about your harassment and how it won't make you stop isn't going to make them go away, it's just going to make them more determined. I'm not particularly outraged, right now I'm just bored as fuck and typing is cathartic. I'm also not an MRA, and certainly not a red piller. As much as I dislike the actions of Anita and Zoe, I dislike TRP an order of magnitude more. TRP is like scary cult crazy. Their actions are actually concerning and they advocate borderline (if not outright) emotional abuse against peoples significant others. They also have a cultlike mentality that everything good that happens to them must because of TRP, it's sort of like someone saying that all good things are because of God, it's a concerning, addictive dogma. I just flicked through there, and holy shit it's full of crazy people in shitty, abusive relationships. As for MRAs, I don't identify as one, largely as I'm very much against identifying as a part of a movement and the associated dogma. They have some good points (custody debates, the draft) but a lot of it is just plain moaning.\n\n---\n\nI find it funny that a woman who just recently fled her home due to alleged threats of violence is now calling for a \"war\" to be waged against gamers in general.\n\nHell, at least Hitler actually burned down the Reichstag before scapegoating the Jews.\n\n---\n\nThese radfem SJWs are a cult and Anita has basically been appointed as the leader. If these fucking jounalists bloggers want someone to compare to Nazis then they need to look at Fuhrer Sarkeesian.\n\n---\n\nThese radfem SJWs are a cult and Anita has basically been appointed as the leader. If these fucking ~~jounalists~~ bloggers want someone to compare to Nazis then they need to look at Fuhrer Sarkeesian.\n\n---\n\nI used to be one of those people who thought religion was obsolete, and healthy skepticism and science would lead us forward.\n\nNot any more.\n\nI have seen supposedly enlightened, educated people fall for this kind of crap time and time again. Whether it's the SJWs/white knights and feminism, or techies and their open source projects. Religious aspects bleed through, and dogma takes the place of neutral inquiry. Certain topics become unquestionable, either because discussion is ignored, or explicitly banned.\n\nIt's kind of like the hippie communes of yore: they thought they could avoid the problems of history by banning all hierarchy and politics. Unfortunately, people are people, and when there's no formal power, informal power takes over. People still form into cliques, there are still figures of authority, but acknowledging it became a taboo, and they all failed due to in-fighting.\n\n---\n\nRant:  \n\nWhat we are slowly seeing here is a peek through doors normally closed.\nWe are seeing the inner workings of the great machine of public opinion manipulation.   \nThe larger issue has very little to do with games.  \n\nIts the same sick control parameters in use today that have been around forever, but when hidden behind the veil of technology it becomes hard to see who the real perpetrators are. Since the advent of new technologies we are being blind-sided by some of the oldest tricks in the book...   \n\nIt's ridiculous that we have to deal with this shit in our own back-yard, but its kind of a baptism by fire, some unaware gamers are now being inoculated against this disease that is mis-information and the forces that sway behind public opinion.  \n\nBut we certainly aren't the first to have to deal with this problem.\nIt's an old ugly monster reminiscent of those late endgame bosses from Final Fantasy (and other JRPGs), just when you think you destroyed the real baddy, the bigger badder monster shows up. And it turns out you have to destroy EVIL ITSELF in order to succeed\n\n---\n\n&gt;A reminder: Now that people in the industry are sticking their neck out to support us, we must see this through to the end with no compromise. If the SJWs weather this storm and we compromise, those who helped us will be purged later. We owe these people our commitment.  \n\n&gt;&gt;It is plausible that the embattled journalist mafia will decide an apology like \"srs yuo guys we so sorry and we will be better\" is their best strategy at some point going forward. \n\n&gt;&gt;We cannot accept any compromise that lets these people retain power. Their ideology will not change, and the people who have stuck their necks out for us WILL be purged once things die down and they regain confidence. \n\n&gt;&gt;Please keep this in mind as this goes forward. They declared war first, and they will not be the first to put their swords down, even if they pretend to.  \n\n---\n\nYesterday many threats were posted that seemed demoralized. And i am starting to hear the word warweariness, there is some good advice out there. (ie take a short break)\nBut i would discuss it about another perspective. We are a lot of people i am not sure how many but it goes into 1000nds perhaps even 100000nds if IA videos are anything to go by. how many 'bloggers' are there 50? and not every 'blogger' is on their side to begin with. If you are war wearry how do you think they feel? Their livelyhood is at stake, their ratings plummeded, they are accused of very serious issues and everyone hates them. only 3 things keep them going their fanatism, their fear of loosing their livelyhood and outside support from silverstrung media/gwaker. but do you really think they can do this forever their emotioal strain must be quite hard especially with the emails being released and a traitor in their midst.\nKeep on fighting guys take a break and support each other.\nMy advice for war weariness (having been in an actual warzone) is to work out (if you're into it), watch some movies, play some video games, get a good meal, have some laughs with friends, and go for a walk. Essentially take whatever time you can to get your mind off stuff. Also remember that you aren't the only person having to deal with bullshit. Embrace the suck with you're fellow gamer.

(And when they didn't, it was inelegant, but at least it was explained. And when they didn't *and* it wasn't explained—I'm looking at you, Statue of Liberty—people complained endlessly. But it wasn't a big deal because the plot of the entire episode wasn't built around it.)\n\n&gt; Cracks in the universe that can completely erase things from time?\n\nThese also functioned consistently. They can appear anywhere, lead anywhere, and are very dangerous when open.\n\n&gt; A massive alien presence living in a star?\n\nu wot m8.

Dirt can be moved, and spaceships take up a finite amount of space, and can hover to places, and sometimes teleport.\n\nWe've got *expectations* for how things work, even if they are set by the showrunners themselves. And it's annoying when they're violated. If violating the law of conservation of mass without further explanation becomes a common event in Doctor Who, then we'll get used to it. But right now the lack of precedent is grating.\n\nLaw of conservation of mass is actually violated regularly in DW, with FTL teleportation. But it has an explanation according to DW mechanics, and has clearly established modes of function. The problem here comes from the explanation, not the event: they said that it's gaining mass because it's growing, but we think it needs matter to grow, so we feel lied to. DW hadn't explicitly introduced any mechanisms for spontaneously creating mass if you are a biological creature, and it still hasn't (although it *has* made viewers more wary).

{"body": "&gt;What is plate spinning?\n\nModern dating? But in TRPnese. \n\n&gt;And should men and women both spin plates?\n\nThey already do. \n\nShould they?\n\nI honestly think fooking multiple people *at the same time* is a terrible idea for both men and women. So no. \n\nBut I don't mind \"dating around\" with multiple people if genital hockey isn't involved. It's less risky, and I actually encourage it. See what's out there! Compare and contrast!\n\n\n&gt;Is it wise for men and women to date someone who is also dating, having sex with other people?\n\nHell no!\n\nBut it happens. Once back in the day I was going through a phase of focusing on my life/career and had zero time for a romantic relationship, but alas I'm human, and every now and then craved a little makey out session or more... So I had a FWB. It was great. I wasn't pressured for sex when I didn't want it, but when I wanted it he always appeared willing to provide. However we weren't in a committed relationship and I assumed he wasn't exclusive to me, so I assumed all associated risks when I had sex with him. Though I always wrap it up when not in a committed long-term relationship. \n\n&gt;Or is there a gender difference on this plate spinning behavior?\n\nSeems to benefit people with supremely high sex drives - male or female. \n\nIf one of their \"plates\" isn't in the mood and they feel like having sex, I guess they can have sex with another plate? But then they run the risk of spreading STIs/STDs to the person who's more or less exclusive. Or they run the risk of getting pregnant or possibly impregnating someone with whom they really don't want to share the rest of their life or day.

God says we're right, catch you later.'\n\nAaaand now you have Christianity in it's early form. Over the years it's split and split, depending on the flavour of the month and the whims of the rich and/or powerful. Now there's too many sects to count, but like any cultural family tree they share a common origin and so a lot of the base values that they believed it originally.\n\nIt'd be quite interesting to go back through the years and find the motives of the individuals. That split from day 1 is pretty much self interest, so the customs of any given Judean religion depend entirely on the tastes and whims of various people throughout the years. A few obvious ones:\n\nMartin Luther doesn't like the pope sitting on a gold seat, you got Protestants.\n\nHenry VIII wants a divorce, you get CofE\n\nJoseph Smith wants more wives, you get mormons\n\nThe whole story would be better than game of thrones if you could get an honest account.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412823681", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "“He’s the kind of person who is second in the rangers and friends with the king.”\n\n“That tells me what he is not who.”\n\n“Stern when it comes to duty but happy to let things slide where it’s affordable to do so. Such as leaving a horse behind for a ranger and her unknown friend.” \n\n“Point taken.”\n\nAeron returns with an extra plate of food and three drinks for us. “Apparently this is Dwarf Beer.” He says distributing the drinks and sitting down in his own chair.\n\n“So, although I have seen you fight to protect elf’s and as impressed as I was by that, I still need to know where you came from. The truth.  And then decide what I put in a message for you to take to the border. Finally we need to think of a better cover than Giant dwarf...unless the truth is believable enough that the rest of the rangers will believe it.”\n\nI dig into my food as Havoc tells Aeron how he arrived on Aldmera, the bear and the leeches before giving a short account of our meeting and subsequent journey towards the border. When he’s finished He digs into his food while Aeron quizzes me for inaccuracies with the story.\n\n“Quite a little adventure. For what it’s worth you made the right choice for right reasons given what you knew. If it was anyone else you would already be in chains and on your way to the capital. Ok I’ll compose a letter for you granting sanctuary with the rangers. As for what you are...I feel like some kind of experiment gone haywire works best.\n\n“You realise this is never going to work.” I say. “The second anyone has a decent conversation with havoc there going to realise he was never an elf...also what elf would get mauled by a bear then kill it and wear its hide?”\n\n“Alright. The truth it is...” Aeron says finishing his beer.\n\n“It’s simpler and explains my lack of weakness to iron seems to be something only I have and being not from this planet seems a pretty decent explanation.”\n\nThe rest of the night was spent drinking and catching up on the gossip from the borderlands. After the first hour Havoc went up to his room to sleep leaving just me and Aeron.\n\n“So... do you trust him?” Aeron says\n\n“He threw himself into a band of Orcs to make sure your rangers didn’t get killed themselves. Those three Orc’s he told you about. He didn’t add that he heard them before I did. And killed the first one and kept the other two occupied to keep me safe. Whether I trust him doesn’t go into it. His job was protecting his people and now he has no one to protect.”\n\n“Like your father.”\n\n“Don’t say that.”\n\n“I know. But you have to admit it’s almost a parallel to him.” \n\n“Look, I trust him and he’s given me nothing but reasons to trust him.”\n\n“Ok. You should get some rest. My men will keep watch over the town.”\n\nThe next morning we wake up fresh and hungry. Heading down I find Havoc and Aeron tucking into the last of the rabbit.\n\n“I didn’t know you had been eating so well Tina.” Aeron says munching on the last chunk.\n\n“Don’t worry there’s plenty for you.” Havoc says pulling out a third plate.\n\n“So you’re off to find the dwarf? I spoke with him two days ago when one of my rangers broke his knife. It was interesting.”\n\n“Interesting how?” I ask through a mouthful of delicious rabbit.\n\n“Just talk to him. His work is good.”\n\nI finish my meal and strap my quiver on, Havoc checks his axe is in place and lifts up his backpack of metal. Walking out we find a horse tethered to the inn munching away at some hay.\n\n“Oh thank god.” Havoc says. “I’ll sort out some saddlebags and sort the metal into them after we talk to the dwarf.”\n\n“As you wish.” I say walking off towards the red bricked building that’s typical of an elven smith.\n\nStepping inside I’m greeted by a blast of heat and steam. “Ay careful lass, I’m dousing tha blasted shortun’s tube o iron ere!” Through the steam I can see a thick bodied dwarf covered in a thick bronze coloured beard. “Well lass if yer curiosity sated, get out, if yer got a job fer me then urry up about tellin me.”\n\nI move further into the forge to let Havoc in. “Well fook me wi a hot poker! yer fekin euge!” Oleg says taking a step back, surprisingly he keeps the tube in the barrel of water. “I take it yer need a metal worker mad enough to give yer a stabber.”\n\n“I want a sword made from a special material, you need a hot forge and be able to work with iron.” Havoc says undaunted by the boiling temperatures, his thick cloak is probably keeping the worst of the heat out.\n\n“Well im workin wi iron already yer tosspot. Ye got tha metal?”\n\nWordlessly Havoc drops the sack to the floor causing what I expect an exploding armoury to sound like.\n\n“Good fookin lad” the dwarf says nodding and setting the forged tube aside on a thick cloth to steam away.\n\n“Cor, you wan a full suit from this a well?”\n\n“Preferably.”  Havoc says. \n\nI’ve moved into what looks like a living and sleeping room to sat down whilst they talk.\n\n“an when do ye need all this?”\n\n“I want a blade as soon as possible, the rest is going to be made later.”\n\n“Fuck tha, I’ll forge ya one o tha best suits Aldmera’s ever seen.” \n\n“We need to head to the border as soon as possible.”\n\n“then i’ll fokin come wi ya. Gimme two days to smelt this and purify it. The’ i ken warm et and whack et wherever ye please...ahh fek tha gnome’s doodad.”\n\n“the gnome is making that ‘doodad’ for me aswell.”\n\n“Yer the wanka ho got im an her bouncin li a orc chasin a fox? Move!”\n\nOleg pushes past Havoc and shoves me to one side before spreading out a sheet of paper covered in charcoal scratching.\n\n“A lever action...can you make it?”\n\n“tha gnome’s workin on it now, I got three more bits to make insteda fourty an ye get a nice coatin o wood to handle it wi”\n\n“Four days, I’ll speak with Aeron and tell him about it.”\n\n“four day’s is plenty.” Oleg says spitting into his hand and holding it out. Without hesitation Havoc imitates the gesture and the deal is made.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412889159", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Side missons*\n\n[Bounties](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080415201626/starwars/images/d/d1/Bountyh.jpg) are side missions in this game. Pick one up at the tower and head on out. They can be in the form on PvE or PvP content. Vanguard (PvE) and Crucible (PvP) bounties are always in the rotation, with an occassional special event being the third type you can have. These, so far, have been Queen's Bounties (PvE) and Iron Banner (PvP). Nice little additions to help out with either leveling your character, weapons or armor. \n\nThe problem is, there's not much variety. Regularly you'll see, \"Kill 10 Hive Majors or Ultras,\" as well as, \"Kill 15 Guardians with sniper headshots,\" or \"Destroy generic target in generic mission\". One of them, which I'm not sure still exists was a crucible bounty you couldn't even do. \"Complete 5 Salvage matches,\" but there was a problem, the game mode doesn't exist in game yet. Wot m8?\n\n*End Game/Raid ... The Final Countdown*\n\nThis is honestly where the game [shines!](#s \"Shines like the shiny pants town in Pinky and the Brain. Only Pinky ever took over the world!\")\n. I can't say enough about how challenging and rewarding it was to finally get through the first raid. It's unqiueness really killed it with platforming puzzles, mazes, and unqiue boss encounters with specific ways to defeat them. If only the rest of the game had been this unique and thought out, I have a feeling this game would have scored much higher with the press and fellow gamers.\n\nThere's only [one](http://cf.chucklesnetwork.com/items/6/3/1/9/1/original/1-is-the-loneliest-number-im-1.jpg) raid though! Each week you can only complete it once for loot, so what else is a level 28 to level 30 supposed to do? We're left with daily story missions, that when done on the hardest difficulty give you upgrade materials. We also have the Weekly Heroic and Weekly Nightfall Strike, both of which are the same strike (rotated weekly), but are done with different modifiers that will change how you play it. You're other option is to hit matching making up for Tiger Strikes. Which, unlocked at level 18, can be done against level 20, 22 and 24 enemies. These now give you better loot than previously found. So you can definitely grab some legendaries this way. All in all the end game content feels severely lacking, but can keep you busy for some time.\n\nIf you can, I urge you to at least finish the raid one time before turning this game in. If there's one thing you do in Destiny, let it be the Vault of Glass raid. (But you have to get there first..)\n\n**Loot:**\n\n*Not like Borderlands*\n\nPrior to the last patch the loot system was broken. Every legendary engram that dropped only at a 33% chance of even giving you a legendary. Not only did they drop once every day or so, but you had barely any chance of getting a legendary in it. There's a reason people used *The Loot Cave*.\n\nSince then, Bungie detroyed the loot cave and gave use better drops. Upping the loot you recieved from dailies, nightfall missions, strikes and just altogether. Whenever a legendary engram drops you have a 100% chance of either a legendary or exotic item. Looting is no longer a gamble as to whether you'll be throwing your controller into the nearest trophy case. Personal experience?\n\n**Broken Promises:**\n\n*[.. and broken dreams](http://whateveryousay.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/v_brokendreams1.jpg)*\n\nToo many have been broken and I really mean that. The whole \"Peter Molyneux\" thing was a knock at the fact that they once said, \"See that tower? You'll be able to go there.\" Damn it, Xbox gamers have heard that too many times. Damn you Pete.. Bungie! I even remember talks of videos explaining the game where trading could happen between two guardians. That's not in here either and the list goes on.\n\nBungie seemed to promise the whole world, and in the end they threw that chance away. Slowly taking bits away from the vision they once promised. Almost as if you were to start with a car, only to sell the tires, the engine, the wheel, plush interior, wicked base and novelty car horn until you're left with only the body. They believe it's up to you to fill the rest out. Which isn't the way to go about making games.\n\n**Final Note:**\n\n*and off we go*\n\nWith the good and the bad, each individual will see the game differently. You'll either love it, hate it or be [meh](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/8753/) about it just as every other game. This one just tends to really bring out the vocal folks in all the groups. \n\nEven with the controversey that surrounds this game, I still recommend it. A game doesn't have to be executed to perfection in order for it to warrant a purchase or a playthrough. And even if it is only to play it just to say you tried it, what do you have to lose from a rental?\n\n**Overall: 7.8/10**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413083291", "subreddit": "xboxone", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Your perception is heavily skewed. I wish we had 1080p 30 fps games in 1999.\n\nu wot m8? in 1999 a fuckin GF256 could get [30fps in q3](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/asus-agp,153-16.html), albeit in 16 bit colour (mem bandwidth was scarce back then). Thats near as nuff makes no difference. A year later the GF2 GTS doubled that performance and maxed out Q3 in [32-bit at 1600x1200 at ~30fps](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/tom,184-6.html). Then a year after that (technically thats only 13 years ago if you really want to be a dick about it) the GF3 doubled that AGAIN and was getting [60 fps at 1600x1200](http://www.anandtech.com/show/742/5).\n\nAnd all that is ignoring the fact I'm referring only to the 1080 vertical lines aspect of the resolution which barely exceeds 1024 vertical lines that was pretty standard back then for most people with decent hardware.\n\n&gt; 1080p only became a standard for games after the release of the PS4 and Xbone\n\nhahahahahaha, really? I had a 1080p monitor for at least a year before they came out and I was late to the party and running mid range to budget hardware (8800GTS 320 till 2010, then a 6850 till 2013, then a 760 for the last year-ish, and that was only cause the insane frame-time variance of the 6850 drove me nuts and practically made games unplayable, the actual fps was fine). Before then I had a 1680x1050 screen for like 5 years (and I got that because it was cheaper than a 1080p screen and I was on a budget)... As of now 2560x1440 is pretty much the standard for PC gaming, people have been buying heaps of those korean IPS monitors (for stupid reasons if you ask me) and every decent high end gaming monitor now is 2560x1440.\n\n&gt; 4k is still a bit off. The monitor thats do it cost several grand and have multiple problems with connectors\n\nI agree performance-wise it's a way off (because developers have pushed lighting effects that didn't suffer due to the consoles low pixel count), but monitors that do it do [NOT](http://www.trustedreviews.com/asus-pb287q-review) cost several grand, and shit ones are like 4-500$ There are also no issues with cables any longer, HDMI 2.0 and DP1.2 are both out and have been for a while, enabling greater than 30Hz and, not to mention older DP standards could run over multiple cables to enable 60Hz (albeit not always perfectly depending on the implementation). DP1.3 and upcoming HDMI standards will allow 4k at 120Hz too and they aren't that far off. \n\nI think you must have been in cold storage for like 3 years or something...

{"body": "I have a friend I’ve spent years playing League of Legends with on LAN who stopped by yesterday after work. He had just picked up CS:GO recently after watching me play it on stream and was really wanting to get some practice in. Deathmatch or whatever. His words.  He really only had dicked around with bots at this point over the week.\n\nAfter a 20 minute aim_map session, we decided to start a few matchmaking rounds. Jameson and Sprite was the one pushing for us to do it, but we decided to go for it. My account is a bit high for someone of his skill level to queue with. I started last month and Im back and forth between GN4 and MG1 at the moment. I have a lot to learn to get on the level of a lot of the streamers I enjoy. \n\nI have like 5 steam accounts from my 1.5/1.6 days. My next door neighbor had LAN parties all the time and my brother and I made sure to have extra accounts for our friends we invited. When steam started, you signed up for an account and manually added your CS key from the store purchased box. Naturally, I still have access to all 4-5 of these accounts with considerably low steam ids (Which was serious shit when 1.6 transitioned to source, literally every scrim you found on IRC, you would first check everyone's steam ID with the 'status' command in console) but they all only have 1.6.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to queue so I logged into one of these older 10+ year accounts, spent $15 on another copy of CS:GO, added my buddy to the friends list, and queued right away. This account obviously had 0 minutes on it. I knew it was going to be noticed once we had a few MM games, at least I figured. That's like going into a game with an 8Digit steam id in 2004 and de_stroying kids faces. Everyone will cry hacker. \n\nWell, we get in game the first game and naturally it pairs us with some silver II and silver III players. These guys are nice, ready to win, and trying. It was fun, but I helped lead us to a swift victory T side, 13-2. I used only the Rek-9 and got a decent 20-10 score first half. Game ended quickly at 16-2 round count, and my buddy did GREAT. He had a decent idea of aiming and the dust2 layout from Source days. He never played competitively but was a pub whore.\n\nEither way, 2nd game is a bit harder, but we manage to do well. I top frag again and there is a guy who asks me mid match, \"Hey Potato, why the brand new account.\" I quickly explain lanning with my friend and my original account being a bit high of a rank to start with him. The guy doesn't respond the rest of the game. Fine. Cool. I assume he's fine with it.\n\nI finish the game top frag but the score isn't all that great. 29-20. Round count was like 16-10. My friend goes 11-16. (First game was like 17-6) Turns out they are ranked GN1 and GN2, both teams. We are the only unranked players in game. No... wait, what? I made a new account so we were not playing gold for our placement games. That's awkward. Weird. Now I see why my teammates in the first round were saying, \"What? You guys aren't ranked? Why are we queued together?\"\n\nThe guy on the other team who asked about my account mumbles \"Bullshit\" across the mic as we are staring at the scoreboards looking at ranks and scores. Obviously I have no rank. They don't seem worried about my buddy, the other unranked guy with a fresh account.  Heh, ok. \n\nFuck it, the Jameson is kicking in and the girlfriend is in bed now, we decide to queue again before he heads to his lady's house. I forewarn him we will probably get stuck against those GN1/GN2 people again as it pushes us up through the placement matches.\n\nGame three is considerably harder for my buddy, but hes got the LOCK on holding B, or at least allowing me to rotate from mid and help quickly. The game goes 8-7 half, Im still leading the scoreboard, but I have another player on the team doing quite well, 1 frag behind.\n\nWe move to T side, win the 3 pistols, and then drop about 4 rounds straight. Finish out the game with some clutch plays and again (lucky for me), I am the top fragger. That’s 3 wins straight. Now I’m pretty anxious to see the ranks. TO MY DISBELIEF, They were MG1/MG2! Umm... Wait, am I seeing this correctly.? Sure enough, 8 other players are literally MG1/2. Here is my 3 hour old account that I'm playing with a random friend, and we are playing against MG1/2 within 3 matches? Gr8 fukn wot m8? How in the hell?\n\nThis opened my eyes to a major issue immediately... You can scale TOO quickly into the top ranks of CS:GO. The ladder movement is almost WAY too fast!\n\nI did enjoy the games though. Interesting to see how placement on that account will turn out.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413296145", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

It is permissible under the Internal Revenue Code for churches to distribute non-partisan voter guides.\"[1]\n\nu wot? \n\nI never said that churches shouldn't be allowed to distribute non-partisan voter guides. That sounds like a plus to me-having an informed electorate can never be a bad thing. But I'm not seeing how you leaped from what I said to what you said. Once they get into the area of endorsing a candidate, they have entered illegal territory, by admission of your own source. \n\nOne of the biggest no-nos is that they can't compare the positions of candidates to the church's own positions. So, again, I'm not seeing how what you said relates at all to what I said-directly telling the congregation that x candidate is god's candidate remains illegal. \n\n&gt;What I find most disturbing is that you're allowing your own biases to subvert support for debate. Yes, it would be easier to just tax the evangelical parishes into oblivion in order to get your way.\n\nNowhere did I say that I support taxing the evangelical parishes into oblivion. I support them remaining within the restrictions of the law, and the law says that they cannot favor one candidate over the other. If they want to move outside the bounds of the law, I'm really not against taxing them into oblivion. \n\n&gt;Conversely, you'd probably find a lot more dead gay people.\n\nAh, nothing quite like good old-fashioned scare tactics. \n\n&gt;Don't believe me? Go look up why the Supreme Court refused to hear gay marriage and grant the latest cases certiorari: the justices want this to happen on a local level before they hear it on a federal level given the national backlash that arose from Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat's interesting, because I've heard that they didn't give the latest cases certiorari because there's no circuit split-all of the lower courts are in agreement.  \n\n&gt;That's such a loaded scenario that it's not even worth addressing. Of course the police wouldn't burst in guns blazing and since you won't address my proposal I'm not even going to bother responding.\n\nAh, missed the point entirely. Of course that wouldn't be the actual scenario, but you're ignoring that that is what the very same people who are crying out about this would say. Since you're so much a fan of scare tactics, what leads to more violence against gay people, \"Lesbian mayor subpoenas sermons\" or \"Lesbian mayor orders police force to bust down church doors\"?\n\n&gt;Yeah, because pissing off Christians supportive of our cause or even those on the fence is a great way to make friends.\n\nWow, I wasn't aware that Evangelical Christians were so positive/neutral to gay rights! /s", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413420158", "subreddit": "gaybros", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It is. Which of course means this isn't a problem with trolls but a much more dire problem. Raging is not trolling. Trolling is saying or doing something extreme to get a negative reaction. Raging is getting angry. The simple fact that people try to not just compare the two but paint them as one and the same is indicative of who is to actually blame. The simple fact that people would take part in this obvious misrepresentation of facts should tell that the people guilty of disruption probably aren't the people labelled as trolls or ragers but the people trying to pretend they're completely innocent of any wrongdoing. The problem is further exacerbated by Riot's support of the liars, a move made to accomodate the large majority of unserious competitors who are often the actual and factual initiators of disruptive behaviour by often being unwilling to play their part; whether it be while choosing roles or deciding not to pay enough attention in-game or flat out refusing to help or hear teammates. \n\nI mean; the very fact that people hate this sentiment to such a degree should let you know this is all true. Try it, you don't have to believe me. Just start a Ranked Bronze game and say \"people that aren't serious shouldn't play Ranked\"; almost the entire lobby should begin insulting and mocking you immediately. Cognitive dissonance\n\ntl;dr: Rage is a normal reaction. The sensitive reaction to rage is also a normal reaction: for people who are not ready for combat/competitive situations(I'm sure they're good people and worth much more than me but this isn't their thing). Which would usually mean sensitive/uncaring competitors move on to find their calling. The problem is that Riot doesn't want these individuals to move on, because there are a fooking lot of them and they buy lots of Riot Points and watch lots of VODs and click lots of links.\n\nThe solution: stricter Ranked prerequisites and the player bans that only effect Ranked rather than the entire game will work so long as the correct types of people are targeted.\n\nThat being said; the OP's suggestion is golden. Ignoring both ragers or trolls works wonders. In fact, I would very much like an option to not participate in written chat at all; in-game or on the client.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413566367", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I concur with you there, Fuck that noise. I mean, *of course* fuck that noise.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's summer in a place like Phoenix (making the car not an option) and you've got a wet diaper of 2 month old to change, and you choose to discretely do the change while obscured on the seat of a booth instead of exposing your child to some NASTY ass public restroom that's a fookin biohazard in and of itself, then I'm not going to give that poor mom or dad a lot of grief over it. Especially because a responsible parent is going to be responsible and pack away the old diaper and not leave it for others to deal with. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413900068", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "U wot m8? DYEcooking?\n\n[4realz] One of the effects of barding is to create a heat shield for more delicate meat below (e.g., it's a lot easier to overcook chicken breast than bacon). Which is kind of the same principle as making a foil jacket for turkey breasts during long roasting.\n\nThe melting point of suet is between 115 and 120 F. Enzymatic denaturation occurs between 105 and 120 F. Collagen denaturation occurs at 140 F, but gelatinization doesn't occur until significant time spent at 160 F. Maillard reactions don't really kick off until about 225 F. Mid rare meat temperature is 130-140 F, so dancing with some collagen denaturation but mostly myoglobin and myosin denaturation. Browning at the top of that fat means that it's already transmitted sufficient heat for maillard reactions to begin, which means maybe 200 F. Above 140 F, the denaturation of collagen in dry cooking results in the evacuation of much of the liquid in the meat. At that point, much of the fat is fully rendered, but also most of the liquid in the meat has been expelled. So if the top surface of one part of the meat is around 200 F, the likelihood that the center has gone well beyond 140 F is incredibly high.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413901336", "subreddit": "fitnesscirclejerk", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've seen so many arguments around here about how Neuer is not better than Buffon as a GK, and they would be valid arguments if not for the reasons used.\n\nFirst off, length of career does not define GOAT (greatest of all time). Sure, it might help build a case, but for you to point out that Buffon is better because he has been playing for 20 years makes little sense. \n\nNow regarding the competition that Buffon went up against...yes, he faced some amazing legends, including Zidane, Ronaldo, etc. But keep in mind, Neuer just helped his team win the WC playing against teams that featured C. Ronaldo and Messi--two players who, when it is all said and done, might be considered the best ever to play the game. He won Champions League in 2013 helping stuff Barcelona to 0 goals over 2 legs. A Barcelona side, mind you, that was at the time seriously being considered to be one of the best starting XI ever by many critics and fans.\n\nI think we can all agree at Buffon's prime, and from the best we've seen of Neuer so far (can't say prime as we don't know if he has peaked yet), they are equal in their reflexes and shot-stopping.\n\nWhere Gigi perhaps edges Neuer is his leadership of the Italian NT and Juventus. His charisma is second to none. However, this quality is not a quality that is included in the discussion of best GK of all time as it is not an attribute exclusive for GKs.\n\nNeuer on the other hand has begun to (if not having already done so) revolutionize the GK position with his sweeping ability. Looking at Neuer's heat maps, you can see that he covers so much of the field. It's basically like having an extra back line defender out there. This changes the whole dynamic of the team as it allows Bayern and Germany's defenders to push up the pitch higher and attack, attack, attack. Players like Alaba and Rafinha, especially, can be utilized more on the offensive end as a result. Manuel's skills with the ball at his feet are not to be ignored either.\n\nI understand the respect for the old guard, but to dismiss arguments for Neuer as greatest keeper of all time just by saying \"u wot m8 did you not watch fookin gigi buffon you young wanker\" which is what many pro-Gigi people are saying here is ridiculous. Neuer has been the best GK the past few years, and with the way he is changing the way the position is played, as well as the way opposing teams are forced to adjust due to his style, it is a legitimate debate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413964860", "subreddit": "soccer", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Rounds are optimized based on operation and system, which is why you see 5.56mm used in carbines and LMGs and 7.62 reserved for DMRs, battle rifles and MMGs, and heavy machine guns and snipers use .50 caliber ammo. NATO armies work together because they have a STANAG compliant ammunition and magazines. The same ammunition can be removed and reused in a different magazine (or even magazines from weapons systems) to fire in others.\n\nOversimplified and inaccurate statement. There are many more kinds of rounds that are used in various weapon systems. The 5.56 and 7.62 comments are ambiguous and misleading as there are different kinds of 5.56 and 7.62 rounds. For example, the AK-47 uses 7.62x39mm round as opposed to the IAR which uses 7.62x51mm NATO rounds. STANAG is a counter argument to your 'optimization' claim. If the rounds were optimized by both weapon system and operation, then standard issue rifles that differ between countries would not be able to share ammunition. Ammunition optimization depends solely on operation.\n\nAlso, .50 (again you are ambiguous) is not limited to sniper rifles. If you mean the .50 BMG round, it is used in the M2 Browning, which is one of the longest serving machine guns out there. Also, the .50 BMG is not the preferred choice for most snipers because it is bulky, heavy, and limits the quantity that the sniper can carry. Then there are other .50 bullets, for example the AE, which is used in pistols.\n\n&gt;She doesn't have to have the same upper body strength to perform when wearing just a t-shirt, but once these units start to field a higher level of body armor, her performance will vastly decrease.\n\nThat is to be evaluated during training and final exams. If she passes, she is qualified for the job. If she fails, she is put in another role more suitable for her, or she drops out.\n\n&gt;Yes. IIRC, the people making these decisions are called politicians. A good example of how this could happen is unfolding in the US with everyone pushing women through combat jobs in the military and to integrate males and females into combat units. Even under segregated units, the performance between men and women will not be the same. Read Bishop (1987, I believe) regarding strength differences between men and women and also look up physical fitness test standards for men and women.\n\nU wot m8? Military and paramilitary recruitment is exclusive within the organization itself. A bureaucrat or a politician cannot force the employment of a person not qualified.\n\nFrom the perspective of legislation, allowing women to participate in combat roles doesn't automatically mean that a woman becomes a soldier. All recruits have to graduate from a military academy before they are inducted into the forces.\n\nStop pushing misinformation/incomplete information to push your own agenda.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414030977", "subreddit": "india", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

You browse reddit consistently on your mobile device, and mention that you are using a mobile device on reddit by saying \"Sorry on mobile\" or \"I would link but I'm on mobile.\" You go to Uni and your Professor tells you a story of when he was working the ER and he had to work on a Native American woman who was in extreme abdominal pain, and you realize that he's saying the Swamps of Dagobah story and you call him out on his bullshit by screaming \"REPOST!\" The feminist sitting to your left is telling you something about patriarchal society and how God is a classic man by demeaning women ever since Eve. She asks you your opinion on it, and you look at her, with your Fedora tipping ever so slightly, and say: \"In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god’s blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence.\" She looks at you with eyes wider then the cat you saw on r/aww. Then, when you look closer, you realize you've seen her before. You shout, \"Have you posted on GoneWild before? I *swear* I know those tits.\" She looks at you, spouts some nonsense she read on tumblr, and leaves the lecture hall. You gawk and you leave the hall, going to your Women's Studies class. Your trench coat flowing behind you, you take your seat. Your professor, a middle aged female, is giving today's lecture on the effect on men on a women's life and how a man was literally Hitler. You stand up, tip your fedora, and raise your hand majestically. She looks at you and says 'What do you want, you patr-\" You cut her off and say: \"This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion.\" You sit back down in fear, knowing what's going to come next. You look her dead in the eyes and ask to yourself, \"Are you gonna whoop me?\" The girl next to you giggles, and tries to hold your hand. You look at her, tip your fedora and say \"M'lady.\" You leave the class and go to your Atheist Studies class.\n\nYou're in the class and you are amazed, reading a plethora of amazing quotes by scientific minds like Neil DeGrasses Tyson, and everyone is having a giant circle jerk while your professor opens the next link on the front page of r/Atheism. One student sees a quote he likes and shouts \"THIS!\" and in the back another students shouts 'WHOOP THERE IT IS!\" The Professor immediately asks who said that, all the while you're reading an algorithm to explain why Half-Life 3 has been confirmed. The class is dismissed, and the qt3.14 that sits in front of you asks if you want to head back to her place. You look at her and quickly reply \"You... You too.\" before power walking back to your dorm. While heading to the dorm, some cheeky little bellend walks up to ye and says \"Ayy u little cunt, 1v1 quikscopes only on Rust, Intervention only.\" You look at him and say \"Yur on m8.\" You rek him with yur awesome skills, and your crew is shouting, your m8 and in the back is asking 'is mum to get the camera, your other friend thinks you got happy feet, and you get a triple kill and some random little kid shouts 'OH BABY A TRIPLE!\" You look at him before you get your 25 killstreak and you say: \"Get rekt.\" The entire dorm loses their shit, your RA hopes you find it, all the while snoop is dancing in your dorm and Darude snowstorm, Da rule Sand porn, Darude SandStorm is playing. A lady is impressed by your quikscoping prowless and takes you back to her room. You're going ham from behind doggy style, and you lean in and whisper into her ear:\"Yeah, you like that, you fucking retard?\" while you finish. You cuddle next to her when you realize that this isn't a girl you just had sex with, it was actually a giant creature from the paleolithic area. You shout 'God dammit monstah, I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" She looks at you and says \"u w0t m8?\" Your friend barges in and shouts \"NOT WITHOUT MY AXE!\" You look around, sit at your computer desk and play Dota with some russians.

Possibly because you were hiding he relationship you had to hide his other motivations or did so accidentally.  He receded into the background a lot for me.  Would have loved to hear more of his thoughts on Ethyl and Kevin earlier even if it is just subtly injected within the description of those two foil characters.\n\nNitpicks:\n\n“She’s got the fockin’ stove goin’, y’ can’t stay in ‘ere f’r long,” Kevin said. (I agree about the slurred language.  It could be toned down a bit)\n\nFortunately, some window had been left open in the back and most of the heat was escaping.  (a window, some window sounds awkward)\n\n“Not a drop of sweat on her,” Gary noticed. (does he say this out loud or think this? Italics would be better for thought.)\n\nHe said, jokingly. (he said, jokingly)\n\nI don’t mind helping out and fixing it up a bit, I use it, too (I use it too.  No need for the extra comma.  In fact this could easily be two sentences)\n\n“ ’S my tractor,” Kevin mumbled under his breath.\n“ ‘S my FOKIN’ tractor.” Kevin said, boldly now, his chin jabbing at Gary. “Yer tryin’ t’ steal it, arn’ you?” (weird to repeat dialog with nothing in between,  could be just reduced to his out burst and get rid of the mumble or put the mumble earlier with something in between)\n\nThe wild accusation came out of nowhere.  (we see that from the scene. You don't need this sentence.)\n\nGary was screaming now.  (you don't need this either.  It should be obvious that he's screaming now, because of the all caps.  Also, you might not need the all caps.)\n\nA black stain quickly grew on the front of his pants as he began to piss himself. (this shows up suddenly and then Gary keeps yelling,  It struck me as odd.  You could move it later, possibly at the end of the argument.  If he does this and Gary keeps yelling, Gary seems kind of cruel.  It also makes me wonder why Kevin automatically expects Gary to beat him up?)\n\n“Jooly Fookin’ third,” he yelled, sarcastically, imitating Kevin again.

{"body": "\"O'Leary, we are simply outmatched and outgunned. We must accept that New Havenport has fallen to the enemy. We can recoup our losses and regroup at the crossing of Fallinstone and Trihedge. You must listen to reason, man!\" Fawkes pleaded, his fists tight with stress and rage.\n\nO'Leary seemed unable to support himself, using the wardroom table as a crutch. This war had aged him like no other. The Valkyries were merciless, butchering nations by the dozen. All had fallen but the United Kingdoms of the North. Welschland and Norfolk were resilient but could only hold on for so long. O'Leary was at a loss as to what to do. It seemed all hope was lost.\n\n\"Pull them out and fall back to Fallinstone as you said. And send any reinforcements and supplies up to the crossing as you see fit. We cannot lose any more ground,\" O'Leary commanded. \n\n\"Do we have any word about the state of the Fifth fleet?\" he redirected towards Donovan, Grand Admiral of the United fleets.\n\n\"Destroyed, sir. Valkyrie drones tore apart the blockade. We simply don't have the tools to defend against these air strikes, sir!\" Donovan replied meekly.\n\nSilence filled the room. The aire of trepidation overtaking the room was interrupted by the cheeky voice of a newly commissioned sub Lieutenant:\n\"Sir, respectfully I may have some good news.\"\n\nAdmiral O'Leary sighed, hesitant to let his hopes be crushed yet again:\n\"Then by all means, share Lieutenant.\"\n\nThe fresh faced officer took a shallow breath and wobbled in anticipation. It was obvious he was doing his best to hold back a grin.\n\n\"Sir, intelligence was wrong. While Chavland was destroyed, not all the natives were killed. One has survived the bombings and is safe.\"\n\nThe room erupted with chatter. \n\n\"A chav?\"   \"Alive?\"   \"Impossible\"    \"We're saved!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" O'Leary roared. Despite his long history of discipline and bearing, he could do little to prevent his body from shaking with delight.\n\"And where is this chav you speak of, Lieutenant?\"\n\nThe Lieutenant couldn't back his smile any further, \"Right outside, sir! I wanted to tell you earlier!\"\n\nThe collection of officers gasped at the news.\n\n\"Why... why... bring him in of course!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye sir. Rupert, bring the Specialist inside!\"\n\nThe wardroom doors swung open allowing natural light to flood into the darkened ops center. A figure shone in the entrance way, casting an angelic silhouette on the wardroom walls.\n\n\"Sup, cunts,\" said the lone figure melodiously. The officers were transfixed. A pasty young teen stood precociously by the door. Acne covered his face and he was clothed head to toe in cheap denim and flannel. A torn beanie sat nobly like a crown atop his head.\n\n\"I'm Brad. I heard this was ta be a fookin party. Where ah the bitches at?\"\n\nThe war council was dumbstruck. A real, live chav. Standing in their midst. The tide of war was beginning to shift.\n\nO'Leary composed himself and stuck out his hand in greeting: \"Agent B.R.A.D. It is a pleasure and honor to have you here. If I may ask, how did you survive the bombings of your homeland? We thought we had lost our greatest resource.\"\n\nBrad ceremoniously pounded the Admiral's outstretched palm. *A classified greeting? These Specialists continue to amaze me* O'Leary marveled.\n\n\"Bruv, I ain't no pussyhole. I just tackled down in da crib and played some mad COD. Bruv, you feel?\"\n\n\"I... do believe I 'feel'?

{"body": "&gt; they are not scientific fact.\n\nu wot m8? I just told you that the very DEFINITION of  theory is that it is PROVEN, when its not proven, its NOT A THEORY. When it has no proof it is called HYPOTHESIS. Like in \"the existence of god is a hypothesis\". Why do you refuse to understand the definition of a word?\n\n&gt; you can't observe or experiment with either\n\nEvolution can't be observed? what? Have you ever heard of [Darwin's finches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches)? \n\nThere are millions of fossils that proof the evolution of species. How is this not scientific evidence? And even if you want to watch real time evolution: Have you ever heard someone saying \"the bacteria is getting resistent against antibiotics\"? THIS IS EVOLUTION! This bacteria adapts on the new environment. We attack it with antibiotics and the bacteria EVOLVES to be resistent. This is \"survival of the fittest\": those who fit in the new environment survive, others die. How is this not scientific proof for evolution?\n\nAnd with the Big Bang you are really unlucky here, because I happen to be a atroparticle physicist. The Big Bang has been proven through a lot of experiments for example the [Hubble constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law), expansion of space time, [cosmic microwave background](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background), [cosmic structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure), isotropy of the universe etc.\n\n&gt;I'm on board with both and I firmly believe that this is how the world works\n\nYou don't need to believe in anything.

{"body": "[All Naruto Manga spoilers in here](/s \"Naruto returns, Gaara's a kage, Gaara gets his dumb ass kidnapped by the akatsuki, Naruto needs to save his ass, Sakura was finally useful in beating the arc-villain for once. Naruto gets back and decides to go after Sasuke because muh husbando. Meets Orochimaru, gets pissed off and turns into mr.skeltonfoxman. Eventually gets back to normal, finds Sasuke, Sasuke's like: \"Yeah, whatever brah\" and leaves. Two new Akatsuki members arrive, an immortal guy and a mask guy. Immortal guy's all like: \"Man, I love killing stuff so fucking much oh my god.\" Shikimaru Shippuden activates. Shikimaru takes out Immortal Guy by burying him under the ground forever, mask guy gets defeated by Naruto and co. Meanwhile, Sasuke decides he wants none of Orochimaru's love juices and takes him down. He then forms his own new three-man squad, with blackjack and hookers. Well, only one hooker and a shark really. Goes after Itachi, kills him, finds out Itachi's actually pretty chill. Guy's been protecting Konoha a lot 'n stuff, so Sasuke's like, fuck Konoha, I'm gonna wreck that fucking ramen shop. Oh, Asuma died, forget to add that part. Then there's the arc where Jiraya dies, Naruto's pretty upset, Shikimabro cheers him up again. Guy called Pain invades, he seems dead set on killing everyone in Konoha. He kinda does. Pretty much everyone dies, Naruto defeats Road Runner Pain, finds out that he's being controlled by some guy living underground, he finds him, mole guy's all like: \"Yeaaaah sorry about that. I'm sure you want me to get those people that I killed back right? Also, I'm akatsuki, the commenter forgot to mention that in the post. Pretty much every villain is akatsuki really.\" And then he offs himself to bring everyone back, making everyone in /r/morbidreality flaccid. Then some shit happens, comic relief villain turns out to be Madara, an Uchiha that was doing some bad stuff, Naruto's training the ancient art of dropping sick beats with his homie Killer Bee, he also learns to control his fox demon, makes him his homie as well. Madara invades, turns out comic relief villain isn't actually Madara, just one of his underlings. Wat a twist. He revives Madara for real this time though, so it's all cool. The arc insues where Madara brings all the previous villains back, fighting muh friendship fighting muh mentors punch smack gobble gobble. Sasuke is all like \"whats up bro\", and Itachi, he came back by the way, is like: \"What's good sasuke, been ignoring everything I told you to do huh?\" and Sasuke's all liek: \"let's beat up Mr. Ninja info cards, because he's in some shit.\" So they beat up Mr. Ninja Info cards, he's become basically some kind of god or some shit who knows by this point, Itachi dies for real this time, Sasuke's pretty sad by the entire ordeal, oh well, let's become dark hokage. Meanwhile, cool mask guy is fighting Naruto Kakashi and friends, and he reveals his true identity, being Obito, Kakashi's childhood friend that was crushed by a rock. Turns out Madara brought him back, and the black/white plant guy was also with him. Obito was pretty upset about Kakashi killing his former teammate because she was a spy or some shit, and then Obito swore to make this world a better place by creating the matrix. Yeah, he wants some perfect place inside everyone's mind that they can live in so no one has to get hurt again, Madara's also pretty down with that stuff. Obito absorbs the god stuff that Mr. Ninja Info Cards had, and eventually gets talked down by Naruto to calm down, take a chill pill, blow one, you know what I mean. Madara's still pretty down with the personalized matrix stuff though, so he decides to become a super saiyan. Guy kicks the shit out of him by activating all his gates, but he dies because of it. Oh, by the way, Neji's also dead, saying to Naruto that he and Hinata should totally hook up for the bloodline. Tsunade's split in half, but not really dead. Madara revives the wife of god to activate the matrix, but then gets killed by god's wife. God's wife is all like: \"I planned this all along, mwahaahaha, I guess I'll take over the world or some shit like that maybe, I don't know, the commenter forgot because I'm going to die by the next villain in a few chapters anyway.\" Turns out the real villain is black/white plant guy, but only the black version of plant guy. He tries to take over the world I think, honestly, shit just went fucking all over the place. Sasuke's back by the way, Naruto's fighting with him, they're temporary bros. Obito comes back and tells Kakakashi: \"Oy you cheeky cunt, ya better fcking become hokage or im gonna fcking shank ya m8 i swer on me mum\". Sasuke and Naruto defeat god wife controlled by black plant, Obito plant dies, Madara dies and is all like: \"Man, maybe I did fuck up a bit hokages.\" Oh, all the hokage's returned one last time by the way, including Naruto's dad who was also a hokage. He's all like: \"Happy birthday son, as a gift I'll leave you with the graves of your fallen comrades, bye bye now!\" But then the last villain arrives, and surprise surprise, it's Sasuke. Sasuke's all like: \"Yo, I'm gonna take all this power that's standing around in the form of tailed beasts which the commenter won't explain because fuck that noise, and I'm gonna become a necessary evil overlord to make sure the kage's don't fuck things up with one another.\" Naruto's not down with that, they go back to the valley of the end and duke things out one final time. Cue epic 5-chapter fight, Naruto wins. Sasuke's all like: \"I'm gonna fuck you in the ass.\" Naruto's like: \"No you won't.\" and Sasuke's all like: \"Yeah I will.\" the translation was pretty shit, so I'm not making that stuff up. Oh, both their arms are cut off. Then Naruto's all like: \"Man, let's go back, you need A HAND?!\" Everyone in the audience bursts out laughing like insane monkeys finally released after 3 years of waterboarding torture. Everyone is choking on what appear to be peanuts covered in butter, as they all begin getting each other off. Naruto's face is covered in Nutella, and Sasuke is bent over, learning the true meaning of pain. Sakura is awakened by the fresh smell of coffee, clear as a crisp spring morning, and Tenten is still preparing to fire off her ultimate jutsu until the end of time. The gates of hell break open to swallow this universe whole, only to gasp out it's last breath being a movie that probably won't conclude Naruto becoming Hokage or confirm any of the ships. I made that last part up though, the manga didn't finish beyond the arms cutting off point. Hope this helped, although it probably won't. tl;dr Shikimaru is best girl. -EDIT- For those crazy people still reading this old thread, the manga actually left on a statisfying conclusion, so props to Kishimoto. I recommend you check that out before/after you watch the movie.

{"body": "\"You don't belong here.\" \nPaul Harper looked up from his desk near the back of the room, wondering exactly who didn't belong here. To his surprise, he found that most of the eyes in the room were locked on him. He had been quietly filling out the questionnaire handed to him by the friendly secretary only a few minutes ago, and was absorbed, deep in thought, wondering what exactly a 'Date of death was'. \nPaul looked back down on his questionnaire , and wrote down his birthday, shying away from the questioning eyes. He was interrupted again by a loud cough at the front of the room.\n\"Paul Harper?\" \nPaul whipped his head up, and stared at the figure standing behind the podium in the middle of the room. \n\"Yes?\"\nThe figure winced and motioned towards the door. \"I really need you to leave.\" \nPaul frowned and tried to smile.\n\"Excuse me?\"\nThe figure stepped out from behind the podium and walked forward, his feet scarcely making a sound as they glided across the tiles. Paul looked at him and gently put his pen down, crossing his arms and frowning as fiercely as he possibly could. \n\"YES?\" \nThe figure winced again and gestured weakly at the door, motioning in a scooting motion, before repeating himself again. \"I really need you to leave.\" \nPaul picked up his pen and clicked it twice before setting it down again. \"And why exactly is that?\" \nThe figure gestured at Paul, his arm sweeping up and down, before finally saying, \"You're not... dead.\" \n\"What?!\" \nPaul threw his hands in the air and gazed angrily at the figure. \"Are you actively turning me a way from a suicide prevention session?\" \nThe figure barked a short, sharp laugh and laughed. \"Paul, this isn't a suicide prevention session. This is post mortem therapy for dead people.\" \nPaul nearly fell out of his chair. \"U wot?\" In the corner of his eye, he noticed that the other occupants of the room were starting to move. \nThe figure shrugged apologetically, and motioned at the questionnaire \"It says deathdate on there. Are you stupid or something?\" Paul stood up, indignant.\n\"I'm at risk for suicide you ass! You can't call me stu-\" suddenly, an elderly man tackled Paul and threw him onto the floor. \n\"You're alive?\" he rasped, his eyes bloodshot, and red. \"You're not dead?\" \nPaul spluttered and gasped. \"Wha-?\" With surprising speed, The old man started jamming his fingers into Paul's mouth. \n\"Goddamnit, how do you possess people?\"\nPaul clamped his mouth around the fingers, hearing the bones crack and shatter. Like carrots. But instead of blood, cold, mist poured out of the stumps as the old man reared back in pain. \"Fuck!\"\nThe figure sighed and picked up the fingers , and threw them in the garbage. \nPaul backpeadaled as far away from the two of them as he could, his face contorted in pure terror. \"What the hell man?! What the actual-\"\nThe figure gestured at the door again. \"Like I said, Paul, you need to leave.\" \nPaul ran. \n\nPaul woke up in his bed, covered in a cold sweat, his hand clenching his pillow, nearly ripping it at the seams. Sleeping pills scattered left and right. A nightmare, Paul mused. It was just a nightmare. \nScooping up a handful of pills and putting them in a jar, Paul filled the glass of water to half, and raised it to his mouth, when an object floated across the surface of the water, nestling beside the pills.\nIt was a fingernail.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414794337", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
