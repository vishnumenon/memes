As a side note, advertising on television is much less intrusive in Britain. It's still there, but you don't generally have loud, obnoxious ads cutting into your show seven or eight times.\n\n4.

{"body": "***Hell***\n\nThe other best friend in the OP. Jess was always the quieter/milder of the two. Hell (which was short for Hellgirl, although I think me and her are the only ones that remember it; some of my friends called me Hellboy for a while in early middle school) was the basically the daughter of Charlie Sheen before any of us got into drugs of any sort, one gear, fucking go. Constantly. Paintball. Rock climbing. Stupid, Jackass shit. This was mostly why we were such good friends to begin with, the other reason, to be honest, is she was incredibly attractive and *not* shy about wanting to get with Jess and I (that never happened).\n\nBefore Jess passed we'd often have to babysit Hell. Sometimes it was parties we were at that she'd inexplicably show up at (most of our group was good about not inviting her to things with alcohol, but there was always that one asshole that thought it was \"funny\"), sometimes it was because we *weren't* at that party one of our friends that was called us telling us to come get her. She was a goddamned idiot and it's a miracle nothing worse than a hangover happened to her, but then again most people that knew her knew I wouldn't be too far behind in those situations and I was fucking *scary* when I needed to be.\n\nAfter Jess passed, for a little while, she was the sober, serious one. I was too busy hoping (not trying, just hoping) to fuck up and die, and she would follow behind me and make sure I was okay. I actually spent a couple months living with her and her family after things with my folks came real close to a very, very bad headline (EXTRY EXTRY READ ALL THE FUCK ABOUT IT TEENAGER TO SPEND LIFE IN JAIL OVER VIOLENT DISMEMBERMENT OF PARENTS), and she kept my head on at least at a 75 degree angle at all times. Maybe not on right, but on and not totally backwards. Very likely I would be dead if not for her.\n\nWe started dating on and off the year after Jess died. I think we made it a month before I found out another friend that we treated like a sister liked me, and she encouraged me to get with that girl. That was weird and ended pretty quickly after the three of us tried a threesome that we quickly \"forgot\" and Hell and I got back together for a little bit before I met someone else, and then another someone else. Over the summer I noticed she was a little... off... from time to time. *Not* like what had happened with Jess, just... small things here and there. Nothing I can really remember now, but she would sometimes do/react/handle small things very differently that would be expected.\n\nTowards the end of that year (2008, it was, bad year, bad year), an old friend (Haily) had come back into my life and we were very close, very fast, and around the same time some rather upsetting rumors starting going around about Hell. She was doing meth, she was pregnant, it was some random dude's from a party, it was *mine*, all sorts of unpleasant things. I knew more or less where it originated and while I did my best to verbally destroy the girls responsible for it (as any mildly sociopathic platonic life partner would), it didn't really do much, and I didn't feel right hitting a girl, even if they could've gained from a backhand or two. So instead, I let Hell take out all her shitty feelings on me, and she said some things, and she embarrassed herself, and we stopped talking.\n\nI went on about my life, this was around Thanksgiving, and Christmas season was my jam. Too much planning and stuff to do to try and make her talk to me again. Gave it time.\n\nPost Christmas, almost the end of January, Haily ended up the hospital, and I ended up staying there several nights a week. She passed away two days before Valentine's and for the last two weeks or so I was up there every night. Valentine's Day that year was pretty rough, the girl I was dating/trying to date (still don't know what I'd call that period, other than fucking confusing) had had a kid around the time Haily ended up the hospital, so hanging out with her was out of the question. It was unseasonably warm, and it rained all fucking day. It was humid and nasty and my parents took the keys to my car, but I was frustrated and angry, so instead of going for the drive I wanted (looked and failed to find the keys, would've just dipped had I found them) I went for a walk in the fucking tropical storm weather. It was disgusting. I got *soaked*, but I decided I was going to walk to that fake-sister's house since she was friends with Haily and I was going to lose my fucking mind if I had to sit alone in my room for another day. Hell ended up driving past me walking to town and I went to her house instead. We made up.\n\n---\n\nThat summer, the girl that I'd been dating (the one that had the kid, don't judge me) broke up with me because her family might be moving. At that point... fuck it, whatever. I was held together with wristbands and gorilla glue at that point. Less than a week after school let out (and she broke up with me), I had my wisdom teeth pulled. Fucking sucked. Had to break two of them with a bloody goddamn hammer to get them out. Hell actually stayed at my house for a couple days to take care of me, which annoyed my parents but let my mom off the hook so I guess they put up with it.\n\nYou might see where I'm going with this. Wasn't even a week passed since I was broken up with that I was fucking some other girl. Don't care, it was amazing. The last day I had to keep the gauze in my mouth, I wanted to go get food, drive through fast food, just to get out of the house for a bit, but Hell wasn't having that. She threatened to handcuff me to the bed. I called her bullshit, but gave in because it was the second day I wasn't rolling off painkillers and the first that I wasn't exhausted from rolling off painkillers. She leaves, presumably to get food, and comes back with food... and handcuffs. I learned about the handcuffs when I tried the same thing the next day, *and she handcuffed my fucking arm to the bed*.\n\nThat was the summer of My Chemical Romance, way too many fucking energy drinks, and constant sex. When she actually started dating the girl I treated like a sister (this will come up later, take notes), I hooked up with one of my ex's some and then started dating some of my other friends literally just to get laid. Didn't give a single (metaphorical) fuck about it, either. Honestly didn't even talk to some of those girls again after we \"dated\". Unrepentant. Certainly bothers me now, and it actually kind of hurts that a couple of my friends still make jokes about it, but IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII was havin' that shit. I fucked up.\n\nThat was also the summer that we discovered Hell was bipolar, emotionally dependent, and emotionally unstable. Our dating/fucking periods throughout the season were intermittently amazing, violent sex, constant shows with our stupid band, and her falling apart. Just, you know, like always, I made sure I was around to pick up the pieces she couldn't. If/when it came down to it, she was my best friend and that was what was most important. It was just nice that we were fucking.\n\nThere were certainly some rough periods during that summer and the next year. The week she started dating Kimmie, she had the nerve to talk shit about the girl that broke up with me at the start of summer. I mean, repeatedly, up in my face about it. Obnoxious as fuck, insulting me and her, just... bad. One day she did it at a band practice, basically in front of my other three closest friends, and I fucking lost it. I slapped her hard enough to knock her on her ass. This was worse than when Ron Burgundy jumped in the lion pit. Everyone got silent I got silent. I just couldn't even. Turned and walked my ass across town to my grandma's house to help her move a day early, went and did a confession, all that shit. She apologized first a couple days later and things went back to normal other than the black eye I gave her.\n\nThen there was the incident over spring break the next year. She hit Kimmie, and I was not having that shit. Nobody, not even the Devil himself, lays a fucking hand on my little sister. I was doing an internship for the first couple days that week, and I had to shuffle around the copy-room of a law office, seething and making copies like a bad Jhonen Vasquez gag, for hours, until I could leave and zoom my ass over to Hell's house. Flipped my fucking shit on her. Put a hole through her bedroom door. Scared the shit out of her parents until they found the real reason Kimmie had an ice pack on her face, at which point they told me not to send Hell to the hospital.\n\nThat's funny cause it's ironic. The three of us sorted things out and I promised her if it happened again I would hit her back twice as hard, and that was that, and then not even fucking thirty minutes later her dad calls me telling me to get the fuck to the hospital ASAP. u fukken wot m8. Literally never heard her dad raise his voice or get more than mildly annoyed at something. He's nearly shouting at me while explaining that, a little bit after I left, she casually went to the kitchen and stabbed herself in the throat. ahahafuck.\n\nKids, unless you want to grow up and be a therapist, don't befriend crazy. I wanted to grow up and be Gerard Way, this was *not* okay. Teehee, like the song! Shitty puns aside, she managed to fuck up pretty good there and the last time we spoke she still couldn't talk much louder than a loud whisper. A *lot* of therapy and medication followed after this, but she was *much* better, I would almost go as far as \"normal\", so I guess something good came out of it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415007470", "subreddit": "lifeinapost", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As usually with new games everything looks awesome, feels great and you are too busy getting into the game to bother much with its flaws.\n\nAnd dont get me wrong, this game has many awesome aspects. In the first few weeks I was exacly like you. I was totally hooked, loving the game, despite most generic pve/leveling experience ever. I didnt bother much, cos I was stunned by all the things you can do in this oper world. But that feeling if \"new\" wears of pretty fast and you start noticing other things, and the issues you didnt bother much at first, are starting to affect you, and bother you more.\n\nYou want to own a piece of land? Good luck trying to snatch a piece of land with unpaid taxes. The hackers will make sure you wotn get it. Despite the huge offensive Trion lounched some time ago against bots and hackers, its seems they are back and stronger than ever. ANd we seem to have quite a few wrongfully banned ppl, which scares me a lot, cos with how fast Trion support works, you may be out of game for weeks and loose a lot including your land in that time.\n\nHasla... is a feature that was intended to help new ppl to catch up with veterans after a year of game being live in korea. Why they decided to put it in the realease in EU/US, is beyond me. One of the worst ideas in gaming history. What is even worse, they are going forward with this ridiculousness realising another tier of hasla wepaons tommorow lol. They are powerfull enough to be a must have if you are thinking of being competitive. \n\nYou say you wanna craft your own weapon instead of going hasla route? Thats good. But do you know how crafting works in this game exacly? How RNG heavy it is? Do you know how much time/effort and gold you gonna need for crafting a weapon that will be an equivalent of hasla? If you know, and still you are fine with hasla being in game wt this time, than good for your!\n\nIm not a crafter myself becouse of the RNG heavy mechanic but just becouse I want to stay competitive and I simply cannot afford to buy/craft an equivalent I am kinda \"forced\" to experience this horrible place called Hasla. But I feel mostly bad for all the crafters, and im sad cos I realise how bad influence hasla has on economy(indirectly).\n\nAs I said before, the game has a lot of great features but it also has a lot of very annoying flaws which have quite big influence on gameplay. \n\nFor me its a love-hate relation right now. There are moments when i forgot the flaws for a while and enjoy the game a lot, but there are also moments when I wanna throw my pc through the window, cos simple uninstall doesnt exacly reflect my frustration and disapointment ;)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415016860", "subreddit": "archeage", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I can't and wont blame any Turkish that will try to flee from Turkey as well as for he, but dissing a whole nation because bus drivers not respecting crosswalks, that is just bullshit. I wonder if he drove in Turkey and if he respected all the laws. I see a lot of drivers park on the sidewalks as well, I don't (believe it or not, though I sometimes might be dodging some rules) but I don't judge everyone, every single soul in Turkey for that. He claims Turkish for doing that, fuck that I saw a lot of embassy vehicles doing that, what about that? Is it also because of the Turkish people?\n\nYeah, good for him to go to GB but what I see here is: \"I went to GB once and lived there a while and liked it so much and hated the Turkey so I wanted to blame every other person but me and move to there\". Fuck that. Lots of people come to Turkey from EU, US and of course GB (how can we forget that) and there is a reason for that. It is not only the climate fuck that, Spain, Portugal has better climate and they are members of EU and yet people still choose to move to Turkey. Why? Because there are still good people in Turkey, there is **still hope for Turkey.**\n\nPS: Good for you getting out yet fuck you and your fucking blog m8, you wot m8?

{"body": "I do all three.  \n\nBenefits of shuai jiao are sorta limited, because they have eliminated any sort of cross techniques it has in common with the other two.  Which is too bad, since there's a lot of shuai jiao in judo.  I like that all the throws are also strikes.  That you don't sweep, you kick and you don't push, you strike.  Also, since touching the ground with anything but your feet is illegal in all USSCA (jiao = chiao) tourneys and many international tournaments, your balance will be vastly improved.  however, because of these things, the throws are more difficult to do and not always as efficient.  They hurt a fuck ton more, I tell you wot.  I'd rather have the judo version of the throw done on me any time than the SJ version, since the SJ version is almost certainly involve someone kicking the unholy fuck out of my leg, punching me in the neck, slapping my forehead or elbowing me in the sternum, and then being dropped from higher since they person is trying to stay upright themselves.  \n\n1)  keep your nails real tight.  It helps.  Can't even tell you how many times I have bleed from under my nails after a practice.  While you will condition you fingers with time, if your hands are shredded, it's not like that's helping them get conditioned.  You need to heal before you go on.  Also, this might mean you're getting pushed too hard.  I'm taking shredded sorta in a  literal sense here.  a couple of small cuts and achy fingers is just part of the process, though.  You want to really improve them fingers, though, take up rock climbing.  You'll be able to grab on like a vice.  \n\n2:A big part of sj is breaking grips and making them uncomfortable.  almost always, having the inner grip is good.  in tournaments, you have to change your grip like, every ten seconds or some crazy shit.  Mostly you want to prevent a good grip or use their approach to grip as an opening to throw.  Work on one technique for breaking a grip, especially, and get really good at it, they switch over to another.  \n\n3:  You're like me.  I hate 3 point throws, and also have a shit knee.  I spend a lot of time with sweeps, reaping and shaving.  Marching kick will be good for you too eventually.  Totally normal.  We have a range advantage and the ability to keep people from tossing us while holding onto them.  We can most easily be countered when coming in for a big throw, so it makes sense to stay on the outside use ashi waza (foot techniques like sweeps and reaping) to counter others when they try to do embracing or some other big toss.

{"body": "Necrolyte needs a team built around him, and Axe would've easily dealt with him, especially as a 2nd pick.  Razor didn't really tank up, and while Jakiro is tanky on his own, picking Necrolyte to counter him seems ridiculous.  Necrolyte needs an enormous amount of farm before he starts contributing, he's a risky pick in the same way that a Death Prophet is a risky pick.\n\n&gt;Early picks should be about keeping your options open WHILE simultaneously as effectively as possible, restricting the options of your opponent. The enemy's Jakiro pick was a good sign of that. Rubick doesn't really do that at all here.\n\nExcept he does, because you don't pick certain heroes when Rubick is around.  Rubick is also strong in a variety of lanes, Null Field discourages reliance on magic damage, and an early Rubick pick does not give anything away.\n\nRubick hasn't changed at all.  He is still as strong as he was back when he was extremely popular.  You shouldn't rely on pick rates and ban rates to determine whether or not a hero is \"strong.\"  Ice Path, Dual Breath, Frost Armor, and Plasma Field are all excellent abilities for Rubick to steal, and this doesn't count ultimates.  Rubick is still a very strong hero in nearly all situations.\n\n&gt;Faceless void with a Rubick on your team. That doesn't make sense to me. Faceless void against a Lich also doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nLich never really did anything against Void.  Even with the Agh's+Refresher, he never really accomplished much.  I remember there being exactly one fight where Lich ulti was actually threatening, and that's it.\n\n&gt;I dunno again a lower tier pick for a reason I don't agree with that can be summarized as you like him and you think it synergizes really well with faceless void (nope he doesn't, pick an SWM mid if you want maximal synergy).\n\nChickenmage doesn't bring near as much control or pushing potential or supplemental damage to the team as an Invoker does.  Just because you can land Sunstrikes in Chronosphere isn't the only reason I picked Invoker.  Razor also shits on chickenmage in mid.\n\n&gt;Troll doesn't offer much to your team at all. You have a natural ASPD carrier hero combined with a hero that works best on teams in a 4 protect 1 lineup. I dunno, I think this pick was a mistake as well.\n\nu wot m8\n\nBattle Trance is a massive burst of IAS on demand, on a short cooldown, and with very little mana cost.  It allows you to maximize any damage windows, whether it's on players, Roshan, towers, etc.  Faceless Void is a hero with a bash, which means IAS is a major priority for him, and Troll gives him tons of it for free.  It also has natural synergy with Cold Snap, increasing the volume of attacks going out from the entire team and increasing the amount of time the target spends stunned (as well as increasing damage taken from Cold Snap procs.)\n\nReally, Ogre Magi is the only hero on our team that doesn't benefit heavily from Battle Trance, because he's melee.  For everyone else it's a colossal boost to damage output for several seconds.  Buildings melt, Roshan melts, anyone caught inside Chronosphere dies instantly.  Battle Trance has major synergy with the team, and Whirling Axes blinds Razor, making him ineffective at right-clicking without a BKB or MKB (neither of which he bought.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415305129", "subreddit": "captainsmode", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "SRS mode le on:\n\nIt's VERY hard to succeed using heavy weapons, but I have a few advice. The fisrt advantage you have is that if your opponent is low on health and enters \"parry mode\" you can two hand your weapon and #REKT him like he deserves. I got to BoB rank 2 using sanctum mace i sweware on me mum(4 reals) but then I switched to fagget mode(longsword) to get to rank 3. SORRY. Still not as gay as katanas.\n\nA few things to point out:\n\n1- Use a rapier or curved sword in the left hand, you'll have a fast poke and(if you know how to parry) a kinda like medium shield parry that FEW people expect. Buckler and those shields are predictable, if they see you with a small shield they'll know you gonna try a parry(they are also shit for blocking). But they (almost)NEVER expect a parry from a rapier. They kinda expect it from a curved sword(thanks to monastery fagitar). You can go with vengarls curved, manly str arabic sword good for chasing and doesnt afraid of anything. The parry also counters agressive opponents once you get the timing of their attacks. A caestus is fine, too!\n\n2- Use a good heavy weapon, in my personal experience the only ones I REALLY liked and had success with were:\n\n-Sanctum Mace: I think you cant do 2 hit combos anymore with maces, but the lance parts of the moveset were 2good.\n\n-Yourgues spear: Kinda like a lance but with some crazy shit that no one expects.\n\n-Lost sinrar sword: 10/10 it's OK IGN. it swings a tiny bit faster than most UGS and hits like a fucking truck(no matter your sin or infusion or scaling). I think it also has more counter damage but I dont remember. The delayed R2s can get ur opponent by surprise in trades and 2-hit them I SWEAR.\n\n-Fume UGS: it's fun. If you learn how to trade hits with those attacks that block ur gonna have good times.\n\n3- Mix up your game br0, be unpredictable m8. Throw a guard break now and then, some animations come WAY FASTER after a guard break. That is why a fast weapon with a parry in offhand is goodalso, if you just go on trying to hit ur opponent with the heavy weapon they can and will roll on reaction and avoid everything you do.\n\n\nThe disadvantages: Using a heavy eweapon ur ALWAYS gonna be at a disadvantage in from of someone that swings faster. You have to know that and NEVER get angry, have fun. 120 agility guys are a pain in the ass. If you misstime a heavy swing you get backstabbed. Faggets that backpedal and NEVER attack(the waiting game) are A PAIN in the ass and I hope they all get the skin from their asses ripped apart and thorned, burned and fed to them by a maniac balding guy in spongebob´s underwear.\n\nBUT, the best part of using heavy weapons, when comparing it to anything else... is to feel like a str badass, like you earned that win. Also it's delicious when they cant parry you.\n\nsorry 4 th3 long text, got carried away, now i want to go and try heavy weaponsurs again :C\n\nTL;DR: try sinners UGS with a fast offhand.

{"body": "I'm so torn honestly. \n\nIt has SO many things going for it, 70mm Imax was stunning, the acting was top notch, the soundtrack had some great moments, pretty much everything is going for it. \n\nThen the story...I don't want to say this is my FINAL opinion on the film's story, since I have a good feeling like Inception on a second watch it will all start to come together, but even Inception had at least some great pay off it felt like at the end even after just one watch...this one just left me scratching my head and thinking \"U wot m8?\" \n\nThe first 3rd of the movie is practically all I could ever want, but then after they enter the worm hole it just becomes way too busy and cluttered. The movie seemingly tries to reel you in with all these algorithms and theories that sound reasonable, then drop these absurd bomb shells that are so out of place...\n\nWhen the black hole turns out to be his daughter's bed room, probably about half the members of the audience laughed...I'm not even joking. \n\nI mean, it's not really a cop-out, yet it feels like one (I know, that doesn't make any sense) the movie does foreshadow it pretty well and on reflection at one point the movie flat out says it early on. But still, it just felt...wrong. \n\nThen again, maybe I went into the movie with the wrong mindset. If you go into this film expecting a bonding film, it's excellent at that. Cooper's reaction after realizing 23 years had gone by was just so powerful that it even had me tear up a bit. Pretty much all the scenes involving Murphy and Cooper are top notch.\n\nBut, there's a lot of time between those scenes, and a LOT of it feels filler. Pretty much every scene on Earth after Cooper leaves it feels VERY tacked on. Until Murphy turns the same age as her father, the whole film is from his perspective, then they decide to switch to her perspective constantly at random moments that to me felt out of place. Like when Cooper is entering the black hole, and then we switch back to Earth for a pretty pointless shot...that just killed the mood for me. \n\nThat being said, there's still some great things in this movie and I definitely would recommend it because a lot of people seem to either love it or dislike it, and you can still find some great things about the film even if you dislike the plot. \n\nBut for me, this is definitely my least favorite Nolan film, however I feel like I need to sit on it a bit. It's 2 a.m and it's only been an hour since I saw it...so maybe I just need to sleep on it. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415517393", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

It's an obvious matchup.  \n\n* Opposed by New Loka: Steel Meridian are ex-Grineer who want to protect the (technically Grineer) colonies, many of which happen to be on Earth, where New Loka feels they have entitlement to.  \n\n* Dislike of Perrin Sequence: Probably because the bad blood they share from being Grineer and Corpus.  \n\n**Arbiters of Hexis:**\n\n* Allied with Cephalon Suda: Hexis and Suda both seek knowledge, so it's a given that they'd share what they know.  \n\n* Opposed by the Perrin Sequence: Hmm, this isn't easily explainable. It's probably ebcause Hexis is just as corrupt as the Grineer and Corpus are.  \n\n**Chephalon Suda:**   \n\n* Opposed by the Red Veil: Red Veil likely oppose Suda because, while Suda abhors destruction, Suda is searching for knowledge solely for the sake of power. Suda may become a powerhouse eventually, so it's better to cut them down before they get out of hand.\n\n**Red Veil:**\n\n* Allied with Steel Meridian: Stated above.  \n\n* Opposed by Cephalon Suda: As stated above, Suda disliked destruction. Red Veil, while they are the good guys, they use violent ways to destroy corruption.\n\n* Enemies with Arbiters of Hexis: Hexis are a religious cult who believe that Tenno aren't merely weapons or warriors, but instead are something akin to demi-gods. They're nearly as corrupt as the Grineer and Corpus.\n\n**New Loka:** \n \n* Allied with Perrin Sequence: They need the shared peace and prosperity that Perrin Sequence provides for the sake of making their goals come to light.  \n* Enemies with Cephalon Suda: Not exactly sure why this is.

All they are required to do is insure their hosting meets the demand of those (the world over) who request it. **Their responsibility fucking ends there.**\n\nIf a particular ISP finds that its particular users happen to like particular content from some particular content provider does not in ANY way make that content provider responsible for the ISP's fucking networking issues.\n\nNow shove off, m8.

{"body": "**Split up just a bit for readability:**\n\nI'm fairly new to Reddit so I don't even know if I'm doing this right, but here goes. \n\nDuring my teenage years, there was a period of time where jobs were difficult to come by. (I lived in Toronto, Canada at the time and it was around the time of the recession). Having connections was key. Lucky for me, my sisters boyfriends parents owned a Tim Hortons Franchise (I guess it would be the equivalent of dunkin' donuts in the US and Costa Coffee in the UK). I got the job without interviews, a resume, or even work experience in the field. Sounds great, right? Well I begin working there in the early summer. \n\nThe location was near a skate park so we had many kids come in for frozen lemonades or iced capps. But there was this one regular that would come every day at the same time with her husband, and order two large bowls of chill and two 12 inch turkey bacon club sandwiches. She was 5 foot 4 and around 350 pounds (25 stone), and her husband was about 5 foot 10 (was probably taller, he was a humpback (whale)) and at least 400 pounds (28.5 stones). On to the story. \n\nSince it was the summer, they would come in looking like they just took a dip in the pool. Sweat beading off their faces and dripping off their hair (keep in mind summers in Toronto are rarely exceptionally hot. Summers there are usually pretty mild and comfortable). I never really worked cash, I made sandwiches and mopped the floor so I never really had to interact with them. Except for this one horrible day. \n\nWe were under staffed because most of the employees were Pilipino I believe and they were all family, and they needed to go to a family gathering of some sort so it was just me, one girl on cash and an baker in the back. The other girl, lets call her Sam, was busy with another customer when Ms. and Mr. Chili con carne came in, so I was forced to assist them. They approach the counter, and I'm nervous as heck so I nearly stutter as I say \"Hello, welcome to Tim Hortons may I ta--\" \"Two large chill turka bacin club combaz with honey mustard and mayo with no tamatiz\" The woman proclaims in the heaviest Newfoundland accent I've ever heard \"anything else?\" \"NO\". She actually yelled it. The husband gave me a look like \"save me\" They wait at the side of the counter and I prepare their food, they sit down and eat the entirety of their meal in maybe 6 minutes. \n\nLady comes back... Its not ogre until she says it is. \"Lemme git sum doonuts. Two bawstin cream, a walnut crunch, and a saur cereeem\" The price of those 4 donuts was about the same as a half dozen box, so I point it out to her, she agrees to upgrade. I then tell her she needs to order tow more donuts. \"s'prize me dear\" I was a strict vegan at this point of my life, so I had no preference when it came to donuts. I added two apple fritters, gave her the box, took her money, and she sat down. She proceeded to open the box, take a look at the fritter, \"never have I seen a doonut like dis oh my\" and took a bite. \n\nI cannot explain the look of horror on her face as she realized there was cinnamon in it. She gets up, throws the box at the counter \"I'M FOOKIN ALLERGICT TO CINAMUN, GAWD DAMN IT TO HELL THAT CINNAMON DOONUT\". She begins screaming and running around, knocking over a kids ice coffee. She then slips on it, (the mugs in the display cases actually shook violently) screaming that she thinks she broke her hip. I was 17. \n\nAt that point I had completed reservist co-op with the Canadian Forces. I saw some shit. But that made me cry like a baby. I thought I was somehow going to get sued or some crazy shit like that. The owner came out and saw me all upset so he told me to just go home and call him in an hour to explain what happened. The paramedic came, she was completely alright, was only a little bit bruised on the hip but nothing serious. She tried accusing the owner of having a wet floor but the security footage proved that these the one who knocked over the drink. Owner gave me an 80 dollar bonus that day, but I quit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415818084", "subreddit": "fatpeoplestories", "score": 144, "controversiality": 0}

Don't get into what we show you because your arguments will be filled with too much hate.\n\n&gt; but hey, we all have our own definitions of aggression apparently\n\nYou expelled up to a million people. That is aggression no matter how you twist and turn your facts to make yourself more attractive to foreign media . Azerbaijan never captured those lands through bloodshed int he first place. Small skirmishes maybe but not annexation. \n\nStop seeing yourself as victims and consider other people perspective. If you want to stay losers then just give up and youll have a lifetime to complain. \n\n&gt; Fuck, Idk why Armenia just doesn't buy NKR off from Azerbaijan and be done with it, Aliyev does like money after all. Oh wait, I forgot...Azerbaijani officials lay claim to all of Armenia...including the capital city -_-\n\nLol don't kid me you don't have the money to feed your own people and no one would buy it from you.\n\n&gt; Absolutely disgusting, Im sorry, but are you actually admitting that the Azeri government is forcing these people to suffer because its politically expiedient.\n\nNext time you have to contain a million displaced people let me know. Its irrelevant, they will return to NK sooner or later. They hate it outside NK, even those who live well. \n\n&gt; Azerbaijan still occupies parts of NKR, so I say keep the borders as they are.\n\nU wot?\n\n&gt; You act as if he cares about NKR, its fairly obvious he only cares about money, and keeping his pockets full of cash. He is a dictator, there is no debating this. He is as corrupt as corrupt can get, and he is willing to manipulate his people like all dictators.\n\nThat the wrong impression you get and that is what we can play to our advantage. I hope you don't think I am in no way an advocate for him or that I am sitting on Reddit and spreading propoganda. You know that is not true. \n\nAs a side note, there is history being written here. If you only knew how ridiculously hilarious you look calling Greater Armenia the greatest nation in the history of mankind etc etc (maybe you don't but Armenians do). Azerbaijan is not a nation, but it can be in a hundred years, and just as you wish we didn't exist, I frankly wish Armenians would just fuck off and continue their nomadic life complaining that they are being oppressed.

{"body": "OK today i decided to share with you how i feel about my favorite player ever, Eden Hazard\n\nI'm a die hard Lille fan, i've been since i'm 7 or 8 and i first went to the stadium with my grandfather\n\nI don't remember a lot those days, we were in 2nd division and the times were not glorious, but we managed to get back into div. 1 thanks to our captain Cygan (what have you done to him Arsene)\n\nFrom then I started to go to the stadium frequently, most of the times with my parents but also with some kind of \"kid club\". I vividly remember being 10 or 11, and getting thrown rocks at half-time by Lens fans during the derby\nEversince that day i fucking hate this club, i know it was just a bunch of retards throwing rocks at kids, but i can't help but hate them, i'm never more thrilled than before a Lille-Lens game\n\nAnyway we had an OK team, made it to the Champions League twice in the early 2000s, and a couple 2nd place in the league as well\n\nI got my heart crushed in the 2006-2007 season when we made it to the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time of our history, and got robbed by Ryan fucking Giggs\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x19gg0_lille-manchester-giggs_sport\n\nWe had a fantastic run in the group stage, beating Milan 2-0 at San Siro, only to be denied by him. I remember how SCARED i was at least 2 weeks before the Man U game, this was going to be the biggest game of my life, when i was at the stadium this was incredible, i even kept the flag with \"LILLE - MAN U, L'HISTOIRE SE JOUE MAINTENANT\" they gave us (history is today)\n\nFirst and only time i ever cried because of football, i got utterly disgusted\n\nSince I had been supporting Lille, we had OK players, sometimes a nice team, but we never could achieve anything better than a 2nd or 3rd place in the league\n\nIn 2007-2008 we had *nice* players, 21 years old Cabaye, 22 years old Debuchy, 20 years old Mirallas, 24 years old Bastos… and some nice youngsters\n\nyes guys you guessed it\n\nEDEN HAZARD played his first game this season\n\nTo be honest i don't even remember his first few games, he was playing 10 minutes at best… But we started to have a nice team, with Mirallas as a promising striker\n\nthe fucker left for fucking Saint-Etienne at the end of 2007-2008 season\n\nbut then\n\nthen\n\nthen guys\n\n2008-2009 happened (Rudi Garcia as a manager), and Eden Hazard became a full squad member, playing as a sub in most games, scoring a few goals and assisting some, but that was not the most important\n\nhe was SKILLED man\n\nThis was the first time I had ever seen a such talent at *my* club, and he was only 2 years older than me\n\nHe went on to win the best young player of the year, and we had big hopes, even though we knew he wouldn't stay with us more than 1 more season at best, cause that's what all players do nowadays\n\n__\n\n2009-2010\n\nwe signed Gervinho\n\nbetween November and January 2009, we had a streak of i believe 7 or 8 games where we scored at least 4 goals, it was unbelievable for us, for quite the first time of our history we were FEARED\n\nHazard was starting every game now, he broke ankles every now and then, dropping back in the midfield a lot to pick the ball and just move past 3 or 4 players to reach the box ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3HlbWVBFSg that goal DAYUM)\n\nHe became crazy good, he was the team leader at 19, and he opened the score against fucking LENS, the stadium was going crazy mate\n\nWe did well in the Europa league, unfortunately Gervinho went to the African cup and got injured, missing 2 months including the Lille-Liverpool in Europa League round of 16\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhQeLgdbdGA Hazard killed it that day (sorry for the shitty music), we won 1-0 (but got crushed 3-0 at Anfield lol)\n\nMatchday 37, we're playing Marseille (who just won the title a couple of days earlier) and we win 3-2 with a last SECOND goal by Debuchy, the dude broke his shoulder while scoring the header ahahah, we were 2nd\n\nlast day, Cabaye misses a penalty kick vs. Lorient, we lose, we finish 4th, no Champions League, i was speechless, how could such a crazy team go without Champions League\n\nSeeing Cabaye tearing up at the end of the game made us all realize how badly the players wanted this\n\nHazard shone all season long, and wins best young player of the year again.\n\n__\n\n2010-2011 season\n\nthe players ALL stayed, for the first time i can remember, no player left the club\n\n\ni'll keep it short because my penis can only get so erect\n\nwe killed it\n\nnever in my life have i seen such a good team, we were giving a beating to everyone in the league\n\nour players were at their peaks (at least their Ligue 1 peak), Rami Chedjou Debuchy in defense, Cabaye Balmont Mavuba in midfield, and Gervinho Sow HAZARD up front\n\nwe were unplayable\n\nWe won the cup and the league, first trophies for 56 years i had no words\n\nI was never taught we could win trophies, the best season we could have was ending with a 2nd place, that was unbelievable\n\nHazard tore defenses all season long, without getting crazy stats, but here are the stats of our 3 front players this season. he was the most important player of the team, despite Sow getting 25 league goals or Gervinho with 15 goals and 10 assists\n\nThere was an article in France Football about the stats of our 3 front players, here they are\n\nGervinho Hazard Sow\n\nShots on target : 42 22 41\n\nNot on target : 34 10 42\n\nDribbles : 191 211 86\n\n**Passes in the opponent's half : 553 1147 521**\n\nCrosses : 15 139 43\n\nWon duels : 134 272 136\n\nFouled : 41 128 35\n\n\nHe was the best player we ever had and we all knew it\n\n___\n\n2011-2012 season, Gervinho gone, Cabaye gone, Rami gone, Debuchy Landreau and Sow gone by January. In the span of 6 months we had lost half the team that won the league\n\nHazard could have left about wherever he wanted but he decided to stay\n\n5th season at the club, for a player who could easily play in every team, that was unreal\n\nhe had his absolute best season, he was perfect, he scored 20 goals and assisted 15 in the league ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaniajSmR9o )\n\nHe was too good for the club and for the league\n\nUnfortunately our 2 CB got injured by February or March, and we ended 3rd only a few points behind Montpellier and newly rich PSG\n\nWe all knew he was going to leave, so we enjoyed every single minute of him in a Lille shirt\n\nLast game, he wore for the 1st time the captain armband and scored his 1st hat-trick vs. Nancy, the club he made his professional debuts against\n\nWas subbed off after about 80 minutes, it was over\n\nthe greatest player we ever had and will ever have. He stayed 5 years with us, played unbelievable football, never ever had a step wrong, just did his job. He remained at our small club while everyone left after 2 or 3 years. He took the club out of its standards, he made us fucking big\n\nNow that he's gone we're back at being *OK* (well we're currently 14th so not so OK but still), but those years, those 5 years of time were probably the greatest of the entire LOSC history, he is the biggest fucking legend to ever play for us, and while we all miss him to death, we can't help but feel like a proud dad whenever he scores or assists for Chelsea\n\ni tell ya a fookin legend m8\n\n\nedit : shittt it was longer than expected", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415975888", "subreddit": "soccer", "score": 114, "controversiality": 0}

Literally never, I move constantly in my sleep, if I can fall asleep. Cuz ya know, I'm always moving. And I'm always thinking too. U fookin try sleeping while ur brain tries to solve string theory and ur leg is trying to swim across the English Channel. And try to focus in school with just that kind of consistent sleep loss and deprivation, mix that with the fact that teachers are literally the worst way I can learn and it's not surprising i almost failed highschool while still getting a 35 on the ACT. Classrooms are like prisons to a kid that literally cannot sit still. Like I mean that literally. If I didn't have teachers in grade school that let me walk around during class I probably would have been a nutcase. ADHD is like recording a video in England with an American camera.

I pull out my scarf and winter pants when it gets -10F. Also you say 100F+ is dead. 1 billion people live in India where it constantly gets +100F in summers. Are they all dead?

{"body": "Righto, just gunna post my opinion here. (I'm from Briggs. I'll leave after this, I swear on me mum)\n\nR18 made their initial point clear on Briggs-they couldn't give a flying fuck about anyone else, and only cared to ensure the happiness of their community. This resulted in them platoon bombing smaller fights causing severe population imbalance. They would pull maxes at small fights, and crush any entertainment being had by others. However, their group would have fun, as they promised.\n\nSo pretty much, everyone outside their outfit hated them, everyone within loved it. The leaders are a bit hot headed and can be complete and utter wankers (at times), but only towards people outside their community. I was a member of R18 for a while, and at no stage in that time did I hear any leader, or any member for that matter, be rude to another member. Just sayin.\n\nWhenever R18 particpated in an even popped, large fight (this shit is uncommon on Briggs) they normally demolished it. Not because of player skill, but because of command. They are effective at ordering and controlling larger masses of players (at least from my experience) and that would seem to be what would do decently on a higher popped server.\n\nIn regards to the linked photos, I have found that the R18 leadership are different people when discussing games compared to when they are not. They were pretty much so hated on briggs that they could do literally nothing to redeem themselves. Positive, helpful posts were downvoted purely due to who was posting them.\n\nJust keep that in mind, and probably take most of what you hear from Briggs players with *a grain of salt*.\n\nTL;DR: Speaking as a past R18 member (current briggs resident) they aren't really massive shitcunts, and hopefully connery will be more suited to their playstyle.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416299829", "subreddit": "Connery", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Personal reaction to this post is that your concerns aren't unwarranted. I think that console owners were expecting more, and while it is fine that the leap in fidelity isn't what consumers thought it would be the fact is that a lot of gamers are currently longing for the last-gen platforms (and the stacks of games) that they sold off to get the new upgraded platforms. And I think that lack of variety and ability to deliver on content is really hurting the bigger publishers right now.\n\nIt is important to realize (like I think you have) that consumers are part of the problem. We clamored for Watch_Dogs, and they released it before it was ready. I'd honestly have preferred that W_D had perished in development hell as opposed to the mess of code that was released, if only for the reason that it would have saved me $60 on a game that I'll personally never play again. But we are the vocal minority, OP. There is a much larger, silent, and ignorant army out there who haven't been burned enough times just yet.\n\nSo really what it comes down to is exactly what you said: stop pre-ordering games. I will never personally boycott a company over the things that have happened in the past few months. I will refrain from purchasing games until reliable reviews are out though. To be honest, I've not heard a decent excuse for pre-ordering a title that didn't involve the basic foundation of \"I don't care where my money goes because I have a lot of it\" or \"u wot m8 gimme tha fuckin game\".\n\nBut I'm kind of weird. I don't buy costume packs (because they are fucking stupid IMO), I don't buy unlocks, and I sure as hell don't pay more than $1 USD per multiplayer map on call of duty. I refuse to allow the developers of Payday 2 to keep nickel and diming me with DLC while claiming to \"support their players\" (which they do as long as you keep paying into the same game you already bought the \"full\" version of). And I do miss out on some things. For example I haven't played Payday 2 in months, because I'm a few DLC packs behind and I feel like I don't keep up with other players anymore. But it is more important to me to vote with my wallet and support companies that support me, and this is a philosophy I have adapted to the vast majority of my financial decisions over the past few years. I'd like to think that if more people did so, the world would be a better place. But like I said, I'm weird.\n\nPre-Edit: I'm not bashing Payday 2, I loved that game. Unfortunately the developers got in the way of me enjoying their game, so I don't play anymore. If you play Payday 2 and love it, good for you. If you haven't played it, give it a whack (you can get it pretty cheap and I dumped ~275 hours into it without even blinking). I'm just done putting my time into a game that tries to squeeze $4 out of me every 2-3 months. There are better/newer products to me that I have more interest in. This entire \"pre-edit\" serves as a disclaimer because I have been raked over the coals for criticizing that game in ways that I have rarely experienced, and will not be responding directly to anyone who starts ranting at me about Payday 2 and how great Overkill is.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416370357", "subreddit": "Gaming4Gamers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(You know what this has been sitting here with only four replies... I'm throwing in my guy.)\n\n**Name:** Shamus \"Asmodeus\" \"Ozzy\" MacGreggor.\n\n**Occupation:** Why do I have to fill this out?  I'm a bloody wizard!  Isn't that... fine.  Magic consultant at SIS.  I'm also a badass wizard!\n\n**Appearance:**  **I've got a HUGE**... (taken from him and filled out by someone else) Ozzy is a pasty scrawny Scott with medium length black hair, that hangs down straight on his head.  He always wears long purple robes with mustard trim, bought at a Henry Trotter (Harry Potter equivalent) convention.  Underneath those robes he usually wears a band t-shirt, usually Black Sabbath, and black pants.  His black leather shoes were custom made for him by a leather smith in Scotland, his uncle.  He's over seventy years old but looks to be about in his late twenties.\n\n**Abilities:** **I'M A FOOKIN**... (STOP THAT!) His magical abilities are astounding compared to his peers.  While magic is uncommon in his world, those gifted with it live in the shadows and he's had to use his powers in times of crisis or if the remote is too far away and he just got comfortable.  He can shoot moderately powerful fireballs, freeze things to around -100 Celsius, and allow plants to rapidly grow.  He can heal himself but he isn't as skilled in that area and it takes him a little bit to do so.  He's a skilled alchemist and has several potions on him at all times.  Now while most alchemists stick to old ingredients Ozzy uses almost anything and has been cited in magical studies as the discoverer of the Magic Everywhere Principle.  He can levitate objects, but nothing outrageous, maybe flip a car if need be.  He doesn't have telepathy but just like all members of SIS he's set up with a telepathic link through their boss.  That won't work here because I'm guessing this isn't his world, mostly because you said New York City and Times Square.  So he won't be in contact but he doesn't really care about that.  He's also talented at transmutation.  He can change one thing to another but only in small quantities.  If he uses it too much he'll tire himself out.  If he's in a long drawn out battle for too long he'll stop relying on magic and then just shoot someone.  He has a small pistol on him and he has had basic training with it.  He's also had basic hand to hand combat.  Teleportation is something he can do as well, but just like transmutation, if he uses it too much he will grow tired.  He's smart but somewhat of a dunce when it comes to some things.\n\n***\n\nOzzy wandered around times square in his usual purple robes holding up a map, of Boston.\n\n\"I don't know where the fook I am...\"\n\nHe kept looking around and didn't seem to notice that someone was watching him.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416376659", "subreddit": "FictionBrawl", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Oh woe is me!  Surely our Lord had forsaken me!  But no.  I warped outside of d-scan range and dropped my Blessed Sisters Probes of +10 Righteousness.  With the fury of a thousand scorned angels, I scanned the infidel down in two attempts and awaited his approach by a container.\n \nChapter Two\n \nShock!  Horror!  My faith was tested with the realisation that the Treacherous Tengu intended to leave the sleepers alive.  I fell to my knees IRL and screamed to the heavens \"Bob, why must you test me so?\"  The response came twofold.  Our Saviour replied \"YOLO you fookin' scrublord\" and my neighbour who is also called Bob spake thusly: \"Shut the fuck up or I'll call the police again\".\n \nChapter Three\n \nAfter quite some time spent watching the Tengu and contemplating the koan of YOLO, the time to strike drew near.  I approached the heretic, decloaked and pressed F2 all the way up to F8, as recommended by Scripture.  His face begged for mercy, but I blapped it.  I blapped it good.\n \nChapter Four\n \nAs the Unholy Swine reached structure, I felt the will of Bob once more.  Giving in, I recalled my drones and allowed the sleepers to claim him as tribute.  Op success.\n \nEpilogue\n \nDespite the unworthiness of our foes, Bob's paladins must show dignity and respect.  I offered a GF in local.  It was not returned.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1416407163", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": 30, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I already posted my story about a dude dying on Christmas Eve, but the overall worst thing about my restaurant days were the gypsies. These weren't Roma gypsies, they call themselves \"Irish Travelers,\" (think Brad Pitt's character in \"Snatch\"). \n\nThey live in trailer parks across the American South and constantly yell over each other with the most obnoxious blend of Irish and redneck accents you've ever heard. Mind you, their trailer parks are immaculately kept and all have elaborate brick porches and statues of the Virgin Mary in their yards, because they're fiercely Catholic and the men are all \"contractors\" who do brick work and shit. They live in these trailer parks but they drive corvettes and nice trucks and eat out at fancy restaurants.\n\nThey look like normal white people but anyone who knows them can spot them from a mile away. The men wear college football polos and gold chains and the women love sequenced clothing and all have the EXACT same Pam Brady haircut. Their daughters marry at 15 or so so it is not uncommon to see guys in their 20's on dates with 13-year-olds dolled up to look like Honey Boo Boo. Weirdly enough, behind all the makeup, a lot of the older girls are surprisingly pretty until they have their fourth welfare baby at the age of 21.\n\nThey come in huge groups *right before fucking closing time* to restaurants and break into tables of 6 and 8. The men chill at the bar and the women gossip at their table with either pink martinis or champagne on ice, and they split EVERYTHING. They'll order 2 steaks for 8 people, fill up on free bread and they dip *everything* in ranch dressing like it's going out of style and get the shit all over the tablecloths. They pay for everything in cash and shit tends to go missing when they're around. Mind you, I worked in a very upscale restaurant, not some neighborhood Applebee's.\n\nSome of them are friendly enough if you can understand what they're saying over all of them yelling at the same time but they are obnoxious and messy as shit. The community of them in my city travels in packs and all live together, so they literally do everything the same everywhere they go. I could see a check in the kitchen without knowing who it came from and immediately know it was gypsies just because they order the same shit the same way every time no matter who it is. \n\nThey frequent the same 10 or so restaurants around town and if you talk to any server at any one of them they will tell you the EXACT same things I just did, because they are THAT stereotypable. It's kind of fascinating, but they suck.\n\nI fookin' hate pikeys.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416441364", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So fucking what, I'd rather be looked at like a confident creep instead of a scared, embarrassed, socially awkward, Omg-theres-people-thinking-about-me kind of guy. You don't think about whether what you're doing is natural or not, you just do it and stop looking around you to see if people are looking at/thinking about you. Maybe I'm not as bad as other socially awkward people. I've seen enough of them and noticed \"holy shit is that what I go on like when I feel awkward?\" Then I realised I need to LITERALLY stop giving a fuck. I actually only realised what 'not giving a fuck' fully means about 2 years ago. Heres an example to show the difference of realistically not giving a fuck and 'claiming' to not give a fuck. OK, so a person who claims to not give a fuck is the kind of guy/girl who posts a status/picture on Facebook saying \"I don't care what others think of me, everyones got opinions, you hate me? I don't give a fuck\"\n\nThe real person who doesn't give a fuck is most likely not even on Facebook, the thought of posting never even crosses his mind, why? Because he does. not. give. a. fuck. And it also doesn't even cross his mind that 'I don't need to tell anyone I don't give a fuck cause that'd be giving a fuck'. His mind is totally clear, there are no thoughts of others, not even a thought about a thought of others (If that makes sense). There is no fucks. Apply this way of life to social situations and result.\n\nI read in some other thread, it always takes TWO people to have an awkward situation. If theres a person being awkward next to you, just straighten your face, take normal breaths and just refuse to feel awkward.

{"body": "So I know I'm a bit late to the party, but the second I read this one story of mine stood out immediately. This happened at the beginning of this year back when I was doing Desktop Administration out at a major shoe companies WHQ. Usual day, coffee, reddit, hearthstone, tickets come in, tickets go out. I then get an urgent ticket in my queue set to the highest priority level. Pretty much a fucking server better be on fire if you're using this priority level. I figure out where the end user is located, (the campus was huge and I was assigned to 6 or 7 buildings), literally run over to their office and ask where the fire is. No visible fire or even smoke at this point. Notice that this office is way nicer than most, read name plaque and realize this person is a C Level or VP. To give you an idea of what I am staring at here; this is a woman in her late 20s early 30s, super basic bro garb, starbucks, iPhone, uggs and all the fixings. I soon realized working there was a popularity contest and ended up leaving shortly after this happened actually. Anyways I ask her what the emergency is and without bringing her eyes up from her phone she breathily tells me that her machine won't turn on and she has an important meeting in 30 minutes. Fuck me. I make note that this is a brand new MacBook Air, not hooked up to an external monitor, not even a mouse or keyboard. Absolutely nothing plugged into it. I do my usual trouble shooting, machine won't turn on when the power button is pressed, doesn't smell like it's fried...hmmm. Finally after bout 5 minutes of fiddling with it I ask her where the charger for it is. \"They told me it was wireless, I wanted a Mac with no wires to free up my desk space\". Fookin eh. She just got the machine 2 or 3 days ago so luckily the box was still in her office. Pull out the charger, watch her physically cringe at the sight of me plugging in her machine, and turn it on. I had to explain to her, seriously explain, that her machine was like her phone and had to be charged. I still don't think she got it by the time I left. This might not be the worst case of computer illiteracy, but this is coming from someone who is head of a major division of a Fortune 100 company. \n\n/cry\n\nTL:DR High end exec doesn't know that you have to charge a MacBook Air.

{"body": "Truth be told I have enough hate to probably go around for every character at separate instances. However I think this fault lies on Kishimoto, and not really the flaws in the characters. The epilogue was more a gift to the fans and didn't neccesarily make sense.\n\nI will catch some flak from shippers across the board for this, but NaruHina didn't make sense. The entire story had been built to end the series NaruSasu. From the very beginning. It's like Harry Potter all over again with Hermione ending with Ron even though everything was built to make Harry the obvious choice. Things like this are pounded into our skulls throughout the series. Nearly every encounter with an adult shows that, even Minato's comparisons with Sakura and Kushina. Etc etc etc.\n\nSo brief rant over, I can't really blame the characters, and I blame the writer.\n\nHinata I couldn't stand. And I think this hatred grew more as everyone continued to ship her. Now while I stopped reading for a portion of the final battle because it was dull, Hinata had never won a single fight throughout the entire course of the series. Every time she did she was hospitalized. There was no actual growth shown between Naruto and Hinata, and she randomly jumps out in a Pein fight and says that she loves him? U WOT M8? She was this completely shy girl in the background that had next to no interaction, and certainly no meaningful interaction with Naruto over the entire course of the series outside of a couple sentences shared before Naruto's chunin exams.\n\nIt blows my mind that Kishimoto decided to end it on that route.\n\nBut don't think I like Sakura either. She has her own slew of problems and issues. However thankfully you got to see her gradually grow over the course of the series from useless to remotely useful as a character.\n\nSasuke had his significant issues, and went from being three dimensional in part one to being flat in part 2.\n\nNaruto went through this disgusting period post timeskip where he could seriously do nothing, and was surviving purely based on his plot shield. Then in a terrible case of bad writing, he goes away for a month and comes back with enough secret powers to defeat Pein.\n\nAlthough some character did some things really well, and had a great narrative over the course of the series. I felt Nagato &amp; Konan were some great characters. Gaara probably has the best development out of any character over the course of the entire series, including Naruto. Shikamaru was pretty good as well.\n\nAll in all, Hinata is definitely my least favorite character in the series. Those that seriously defend her defend her with opinions forged from fanfiction, and movies or filler(which is not showcased in the actual manga, and therefore matters little to me) There was absolutely nothing in regards to her development as a real character in the manga. She had been relegated to a girl that had a crush on Naruto from day one, and she continued down that path for the entirety of the series with no real investment put into her as far as a the story is concerned.\n\nIn the OP I am surprised that you have issues with Ino when she was largely the catalyst for who Sakura ended up being later in life. She had a purpose, and was a plot device.\n\nHinata was a barbaric butchering of everything that had been established for the real and actually tangible relationships in the story developed over the course of 700 damn chapters.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416623176", "subreddit": "Naruto", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Truth be told I have enough hate to probably go around for every character at separate instances. However I think this fault lies on Kishimoto, and not really the flaws in the characters. The epilogue was more a gift to the fans and didn't neccesarily make sense.  \n\nThere's only so much you can write in 20 pages. It left a lot of questions on purpose since The Last and the mini-series have yet to come out.  \n\n&gt;I will catch some flak from shippers across the board for this, but NaruHina didn't make sense. The entire story had been built to end the series NaruSasu. From the very beginning. It's like Harry Potter all over again with Hermione ending with Ron even though everything was built to make Harry the obvious choice. Things like this are pounded into our skulls throughout the series. Nearly every encounter with an adult shows that, even Minato's comparisons with Sakura and Kushina. Etc etc etc.  \n\nKushina told Naruto to find a girl like her, but when Naruto was talking to Minato as he was fading away, he said he wasn't able to do everything Kushina asked him to do right after saying \"Mom told me to find a woman like her.\" Also, Naruto seeing through Sakura's fake confession (which was a bitch move if you ask me) and him being supportive of Sakura's love for Sasuke were enough to debunk NaruSaku. Naruto is hot-headed like his mother whereas Hinata is calm and kind like Minato.  \n\n&gt;So brief rant over, I can't really blame the characters, and I blame the writer.  \n\nYour whole comment was a rant about the entire series, actually.  \n\n&gt;Hinata I couldn't stand. And I think this hatred grew more as everyone continued to ship her. Now while I stopped reading for a portion of the final battle because it was dull, Hinata had never won a single fight throughout the entire course of the series. Every time she did she was hospitalized. There was no actual growth shown between Naruto and Hinata, and she randomly jumps out in a Pein fight and says that she loves him? U WOT M8? She was this completely shy girl in the background that had next to no interaction, and certainly no meaningful interaction with Naruto over the entire course of the series outside of a couple sentences shared before Naruto's chunin exams.  \n\nShe was the first person to ever acknowledge Naruto, and she didn't love him for his looks unlike most of the other girls towards Sasuke, but for the person he was. Thanks to Naruto, she also grew as a character and wasn't this weak shy girl anymore. /u/cloistered_around wrote some good NaruHina developments below, but don't forget that, in the Pain Invasion arc, she was gladly willing to give up her own life in order to save and put some sense back into the person she loved, while Sakura was crying for Naruto's help. Also, in the war, after Hinata woke up Naruto from his depression, she wasn't a shy girl anymore, and you could actually see from that point onward that Naruto started liking her. I could go on for ages, but I'm tired.  \n\n&gt;Sasuke had his significant issues, and went from being three dimensional in part one to being flat in part 2.  \n\nRidding himself of his emotions and being a flat character are two different things. What would you have done if your beloved big brother assassinated your entire lineage in front of your eyes, and after living years of your life for the sole purpose of killing him and finally achieving your goal, you learn that he was ordered to do it by the village elders? The fact that he was able to look past all that and change during the final chapters really shows his development.  \n\n&gt;In the OP I am surprised that you have issues with Ino when she was largely the catalyst for who Sakura ended up being later in life. She had a purpose, and was a plot device.  \n\nYeah, she helped Sakura's development.

I mean come on, we all know boobs are filled with water. And if we have learned anything from human nature we know that anything filled with water must be squeezed. \n\nWhat is happening here is very simple science. The boobs in question were unintentionally squeezed because the gentlemen in control of the bike either braked too hard or accelerated too hard. We know from newtons third law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Applying that principle to either case of braking too hard or accelerating too hard, the boobs were put under pressure. Based on this we can use the formula P=f/a to come to the conclusion that the resulting pressure created another instance of newtons third law. This time it was localized inside the boob. Rather than exerting force in the opposite direction, the boobs exerted water. The water acts as a safety mechanism to prevent the boobs from losing too much squeezability. \n\nMy expert advice to the women is that she should drink two glasses of water, one for each boob to replace the lost water followed by a rigorous squeeze session to check for any balance irregularities. \n\n\nTl:DR: Boobs are awesome.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416875694", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "___\n**Cimbrean**\n\n“So, how much do you know about what’s been going on back home?”\n\nJennifer Delaney, mid-twenties, space-babe with a mouthful of the first chocolate she’d tasted in *years*, regretfully swallowed it.\n\n“Not much.” She confessed. “The alien news only covered the big things: the Hunters attacked Vancouver?”  when Powell nodded, she continued. “Then there’s a fecking big force-field, we have warp travel now… That’s about it. I know that our ambassador to the Dominion is called Doctor Anees Hussein because he wrote me a letter, and he hinted that we’re maybe wanting to play both sides to our advantage, but other than that, I’m pretty well in the dark.”\n\n“Right. Well, it’s mostly business as usual.” Powell said. “The usual political gobshites, same sports, same celebrity gossip, same bullshit in the Middle East. The Russians are still fookin’ crazy, the Chinese still have a stick up their arses, the Yanks are still fookin’ reckless and there’s still a Marvel movie three times a year like fookin’ clockwork.”\n\n“Nothing’s changed at all?”\n\n“I didn’t say that. NASA and the European Space Agency merged to form the North Atlantic Space Agency, the Chinese, Russians and Japanese are all stepping up their space programs, as are the South Americans and the Australians, and there’s even the Pan-Africa Space Organisation now. I think they’re mostly looking at trying to build space elevators, which is easier at the equator or something.”\n\nHe sniffed. “A whole bunch of private companies are pushing into space as fast as they can, too. BAE, Virgin, Mitsubishi, Shenyang, Red Bull…”\n\n“*Red Bull?!*”\n\n“Dont ask. And the cutting edge military technology is… fook me sideways, if you were cleared to know about half of it, you’d shit your new pants.”\n\n“How much AM I cleared to know about?”\n\n“Right, so we took a look at the way business is done out here and promptly said “fook that”, right? Giant fookin’ spaceships with giant fookin’ guns and even gianter fookin’ armour plates pounding the living shite out of each other at spittin’ distance. They’ve got missiles and mines nowadays - apparently they picked that trick up off one of us - but their whole approach is pretty bloody direct.”\n\n“Oh. Really? One of, um, us?”\n\n“Yep. Like to get my hands on that wanker, whoever he was. Give him a lesson in keeping his fookin’ mouth shut.” Powell’s tone was light, but he had a dangerous look in his eye that reminded her a bit of Adrian, though not in a happy way.\n\nJen suddenly became very grateful for the practice she’d had in the art of lying, and bobbled her head in a way that could mean anything but didn’t really meaning anything *specific*. Powell apparently took it agreeably.\n\n“Anyway,” he continued “the ships we’re putting up - or, at least, the Lockheed ones that NATO are buying - are built around *not* that. Long-range weaponry, evasive maneuvers, fookloads of electronic warfare. We use capacitors full of reserve power rather than big reactors, so our ships are small and agile little buggers, built to hit and fade, rip things a new one in the opening seconds, then jump out, recharge, come back and do it again.”\n\n“Our weapons stack up to theirs?” Jen asked. That part was genuine news. She’d known for some time that most weapons that she might find pointed at her were nowhere near as deadly as their equivalent on Earth, but she had always assumed that with thousands of years of science behind them, spaceship guns would be far in advance of anything humanity had yet invented.\n\n“In theory.” Powell said, clearly unhappy about not being able to give a more emphatically positive answer. “Because all their stuff’s based around railguns and plasma cannons, our own weapons, which are neither of those things, should be something they don’t know how to handle. Their shields are tuned to stop slow-firing high-energy projectiles traveling at like, one percent of lightspeed, and the armour’s designed for heat dissipation: it’s all ceramic tiles, fragile as balls.”\n\n“So, if we fire a howitzer at them or something?” Jen asked him, latching on to the first “big gun” word she could think of.\n\n“I see what you’re thinking, but nah. It’d just explode against the shields: too slow-firing. But in theory, if we just chuck a load of lower-energy projectiles at them it’ll overwhelm the shields and smash the armour. See?”\n\n“I’ll... have to take your word on all of that.”\n\nPowell smiled. “I take it you’re not a military hardware geek?\n\n“Not really.”\n\n“Well, I am, and the Lockheed TS-101 gives me a hell of a chubby.”\n\n“Charming.” she deadpanned, trying to give the impression that there were more important matters on her mind than the state of his junk.  It seemed to work, because Powell cleared his throat and his smile faded.\n\n“Right. Sorry.” He scratched his upper lip with his thumb, lips pursed in thought. “Anyway, back on topic. There’s… a lot of legal questions about Cimbrean here.”\n\n“Like what?” Jen asked, surprised. She had assumed that all of those questions would have been sorted out long before the soldiers came here.\n\nPowell ticked each question off on his fingers as he asked them. “Is this a colony of any one nation? And if so, which one? Or is it its own nation? in which case are you going to have a constitution, are you going to be a democracy? What’s your immigration policy? What are you going to export and import? What’s the customs policy on things like, say, seeds and foodstuffs, because from what I’m told our native Terran species would go through this lot -”  he waved an arm, expansively indicating the ecosystem of an entire planet “-like vindaloo through a short grandma.” \n\n“There are questions about you, too.” he added, looking her in the eye. “You were given the job because you were here and because we heard you’d built something, but seeing as what you apparently built is a battlefield, do you even want it any more? Do you want to go home to Earth? Because the next time Kirk swings by here he’ll be able to send you back, no problem. Do you want to stay on as governor, or hand the job off to somebody else?”\n\nJen’s brow creased as she considered this. “I hadn’t even thought of *any* of those questions.” she confessed. “How much of being a colonial governor would be like that? Desk work, lawmaking, thinking about all the fiddly little details and all that?” She asked.\n\n“Fookin’ near all of it, I’d imagine.” Powell said.\n\n“Then I want to be replaced as soon as possible.” Jen said, firmly. There was no *way* she could go back to a job that even looked and smelled faintly like I.T., not after her experiences out here. \n\n“You sure? Could be a nice desk. Big salary. Power, fame and influence?”\n\nFor once, Old Jen and New Jen were in total agreement. “I’d rather just be a space-babe.” She demurred, her voice completely full of resolve. \n\nPowell nodded approvingly. “Good for you.”\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416961882", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 95, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "___\n**Cimbrean**\n\n“Well, even if you pass the baton first chance you get, you’re still technically in charge of every civilian aspect of this colony for the time being.” Powell said. He snatched a clipboard from where it was hanging on a tent post and consulted it.\n\n“Let’s see… There’s a list of stuff they’d like you to do. Nothing major: name the colonial capitol,  identify any existing human citizens, living or dead... we’ve  got real-time two-way communications with Earth but a pretty small data budget of what we can send and receive: more like telegraph than anything. To be honest, there’s not much for you to do. Anything on this list you DO do will be taken under advisement by the civilian experts and contractors we bring in once this place is secure and the camp’s up and running smoothly.”\n\n“That doesn’t sound like it’ll take a whole month.” Jen said.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of tech to deploy, a perimeter to establish, scouting to do, maybe an FOB or two to set up..”\n\n“FOB?”\n\n“Forward Operating Base. Somewhere small and camouflaged where if this place is bombed off the map… again… there’ll be a couple of guys left behind to report mission failure.”\n\n“Sounds boring.” Jen complained.\n\n“We’ll find stuff for you to do.” Powell promised. “And I mean USEFUL stuff, now.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n“So? Any ideas as to the colonial capitol’s name?”\n\n“A… few. I’ll sleep on that one.”\n\n“Fair enough. Okay… have you met any other humans out here? Besides Darragh Houston, that is. Actually, where IS he?” Powell grabbed a different clipboard and leafed through it.\n\n“Feck knows. The last I saw of him he was on his way back here, but I did some looking around while I was filling up my bath, and didn’t find any sign of him.”\n\n“Okay, he’s an unknown then…” Powell stopped looking at the page he’d turned  to. “Any others?”\n\n“Is that a list of abductees?”\n\n“Every unaccounted-for human outside of Sol, in theory. Don’t ask me how they got it, I don’t know.”\n\n“Okay, uh… a few. Adr… um, actually let’s start with, uh, Margarita. I can’t remember her surname, she was a dwarf, Spanish.”\n\n“Was?”\n\n“Yeah. She um… well, the honest truth is that an invisible death robot cut her open.”\n\n“Invis…? O...kay. I think you’re going to need to brief us on those things.”\n\n“I will.” Jen promised.\n\n“Right.” Powell ticked something on his list. “Here she is.  Deceased. At least we’ll be able to let her family know. Any others?”\n\n“Cameron White. Very deceased and good fucking riddance.”\n\nPowell blinked, then flicked through his list. “Oh. Shit.  Fookin’ hell, what were they thinking stealing a crazy wanker like that?” he ticked.  “Good fookin’ riddance, aye.”\n\n“And uh… Adrian Saunders. Australian Defence Force….” she forced herself not to give in to the temptation to look down, whisper and cry. “...Deceased.”\n\n“Wow. You’ve had a bad time of it…” Powell sighed, flipping through,his document, then ticked off against, presumably, Adrian’s name. “Deceased. Guess his wife and kid will have closure at least…”\n\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416961951", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 93, "controversiality": 0}

And while Daimler's HQ might be located in Stuttgart, the true home of Mercedes Benz, and the car, remains Mannheim, where Benz manufactures to this day. Because of Stuttgart's filthy propaganda (I assume) over the decades, the wrong notion of Daimler inventing the car has made it into trivia card games and the like. But no more! The God of cars will have his due, and his only son is Carl Benz, who came to live among the mortals to free us from our limited mobility, horse shit, and clean air.

Shared environment is the common family environment, while the nonshared or unique environment is what's left over. \nNow as people age, the shared environment component usually goes to zero for most behavioral traits, not just IQ. And the unique environment component is left over which in turn might simply be the genetic propensity to alter the environment to one's own likes, and even that might not be really important.

Or former squire to The Mountain That Rides. Does not mean he is not a Varys spy or such as well. And the Stannis connection is not so strange if he left home for adventure, joined a Renly company, and got switched to Stannis after Renly's death.\n\n**Renly was very popular in Kings Landing** so many may have left the capitol  to fight for  Renly, and after his death their captains all switched to Stannis.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417127597", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wot m8?  R u 4 reals?\n\nSeriously, though, *everyone* has a family history of *something*.  The people who don't seem to just haven't had their things diagnosed, because predisposition =/= incidence and because correlation does not demonstrate causation.  The human body is a phenomenally, unbelievably, incomprehensibly complicated thing, and the chances that any person in the history of the human race having truly \"clean\" genetics is so low that, so far as mathematicians would be concerned, it would be equal to zero.  Even assuming that, we know that DNA gets changed to some degree while a person is living as a result of their exposure to various stimuli, which means that even a hypothetical person born with impossibly \"clean\" genes might no longer have them, or a person with the worst predispositions imaginable might miraculously adapt and overcome them.\n\nStep back and think for a minute: we can't say for certain what degree sexuality is linked with genetics; we know that there's certainly *some* linkage, but we can't say how much, what, or why, despite the fact that it's been a major locus of investigation for two or three decades at this point.  Do you really think that we have even **begun** to really understand the interactions that our genetic structures have on our overall, immediate, and long-term health?  \n\nThe idea that we can breed for or even have clean genetics is stupid as hell, and the presumption that YOU have the sort of \"clean\" genetics that you're demanding out of a partner is pretty much the single most arrogant thing I've ever heard anyone imply, ever; alternately, if you're demanding that perfection of a partner when you can't live up to the same, you're a truly hypocritical little fuck.\n\nIf you're trying to choose a partner on those ground, buddy, you deserve whatever you get.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417154917", "subreddit": "AskMen", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry I'm posting this, it seems pointless; but to me I just feel like I need to get it out and I feel like someone out there may change their attitude once they read this.\n\nIts hard to put into words how I feel, but in the past two to three months my perspective on everything has completely changed. I feel so chilled about everything, and I just love the idea of not having a fixed plan and just seeing where life will take me. I had been having the shittest year, lots of crap has happened but suddenly my attitude changed. I can literally push any negative thoughts out of my head, I am so positive about everything and nothing anyone says bothers me. I just don't give no shits.\n\nI recently broke up with my girlfriend as we were long distance, and for us to close the distance it would have taken 5-7 years of waiting while she completed university. It came to me that I couldn't let days of my teenage years go past while I skyped every night and waited for something to happen while everyone else was out there living life. I can't say that I regret this relationship at all though, going out with this girl made me so confident; as knowing that you don't need to impress any girls because you have a girlfriend of your own made me be myself and nothing else. Now in my group of friends I am one of two guys, the other eight all being girls. I can quite easily make conversation with anyone I like and I have the confidence to actually tell girls how I feel about them straight to their face. I fookin' love it mate. \n\nIn the past month and a half I have gone to at least one party a weekend, and most of the time I end up staying the night and having to drag myself to work at 8 in the morning; but that's part of the fun, you just have to get on with it. Me and my bestfriend seem to be the only ones who can have a good time sober, I'm usually found dancing alone when everyone else is too shy to let their hair go \n\nAfter college I'm off travelling with my bestfriend. She is just like me and doesn't give one shit what anyone thinks of her so we get on so bloody well. The one and only plan we have is to go to the US, buy a pickup truck and live in that while we head wherever we feel like going. \n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is. You only have one life.

{"body": "u wot m8 i swear on me mum \n\nDigital Witness is the only explicitly anti-technology song she's written under the St. Vincent project. Love This Giant had I Should Watch TV, which is a similar song thematically. Huey Newton actually revels in technology. Well, Huey Newton is lyrically a very complicated and ambiguous song. But I think it can be read to be pro-internet. \n\nI don't think any of us should be blindly pro-technology (I don't think any of us should be blindly pro-anything but that's not entirely relevant right now). Even Holly Herndon, possibly the most radically pro-digital musician I've ever come across and a source of a lot of my pro-laptop-as-instrument sentiments, has a complicated relationship with her computer and technology (as particularly shown in the juxtaposition of the \"Chorus\" and \"Home\" videos). I think responding to the possibilities and drawbacks internet life brings is a necessary part of being a responsible citizen of the internet. Understanding exactly what \"the computer\" is is necessary.\n\nI do think that the Digital Witness lyrics are a little too blunt for their own good. However, as a musician, Clark is not anti-technology. She currently tours with 3 people behind her. There's the keyboardist (used to be Daniel Mintseris, but he dropped out when his wife had a baby), Toko Yasuda who plays second guitar and keys, and her drummer Matt Johnson. All three of them play digital/electronic instruments (Yasuda and the other keyboardist play analog electronic keyboards, possibly minimoogs but I'm not sure) and the drummer has a full MIDI drum set up along with his kit. The analog purists we rag on (e.g. Dave Grohl) wouldn't allow such things. She plays a theremin on stage (Northern Lights). There are wonky electronic sounds all throughout the self-titled. \n\nThere's a difference between having a complicated relationship with technology and being staunchly anti-technology.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417228170", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Are you not a part of this? \n\nI know this may sound as an insult to ask you that, but think about it. You are a self described 'Free Radical', whatever the fuck that means. You are also talking about 'the left'. \n\nI'm seriously of the opinion that the 'left vs right' bullshit people buy into like fucking sheep, or like people brought up in a Muslim country vs someone brought up in Texas or somebody who feels 'lost' in the world turning to scientology.. a political ideology such as 'Free Radical' is just that. \n\nI honestly DO NOT GIVE A FUCK about being libertarian. I don't give a fuck about what UKip classifies its self as, as a party. I simply do not believe in political ideology. I vote UKip because reading the manifesto and the viewpoints UKip has resonate with me. They seem to be the ones saying 'u wot m8', whereas every other political party just want more of the same old bollocks. \n\nCameron is throwing his rattle out the pram and getting the occasional slap from Merkle, saying 'shut up you soft cunt', and stick his dummy back in.. meanwhile nothing changes and we can't get a referendum on the EU until AFTER THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION? WHEN HE PROMISED ONE BEFORE THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION? \n\nIn the average voters mind, who watches the BBC, let's be honest if they push 'UKIP IS STUPID LOL RACIST', people who aren't into politics or don't care to delve deeper.. they'll just take that stance against UKip without questioning what it is UKip stand for or any points they have to raise. \n\nWhy? Because pushing any ideology onto a population works fucking wonders. People need to identify with others, it's how cultures are formed. UKip's success thus far shows how anybody can come from nowhere, identidy with UKip, push the UKip message via lip service.. and suddenly the whole fucking political elite is like WTF happened?\n\nYou, identifying as something are putting yourself into a category. Categorising thoughts and identifying or thinking along the lines of thoughts that fit into your category is toxic. It blurs your vision of new thoughts, hindering you to make up your own mind about the world. \n\nJust thought I'd put my perspective out there, I'm a UKip voter and vote UKip every fucking chance I get because times need to change. We should not be a nation with no air craft carriers, a nuclear deterrent from the 70's, a place filled with ghettos and a country that sells it's public services to private business, enabling whichever private business chosen to prosper over a different private business because the people voted in by people who vote on ideology decide so. \n\nIt's time we stopped playing ourselves like fools as members of the general public. Non-ideological thinking must surely be the way forward for us as a species, the world over... it's actually that deep and UKip are opening the doorway into future.

{"body": "It depends on what kind of WBC it is. The quick and dirty Reddit answer is...\n\nA macrophage finds a pathogen and says \"U fkin wot m8?\" before devouring it whole, breaks it up into pieces, and then protrudes the antigens (identifying protein marker) outside of itself to \"show\" other WBCs what the invader \"looks like\". \n\nT cells, natural killer, and B cells all play a role once alerted to the presence of something nasty by a phagocyte wearing the body parts of a fallen enemy around.\n\n\nHelper T cells will see this and activate an immune response. Dormant B cells in lymph nodes hear the sounded alarm and go ham. You get swollen and a sore throat.\n\nCytotoxic T cells go all delta force and start a seek and destroy mission on both the pathogens and any of your own cells that are infected. They use chemicals and enzymes as their weapons of choice. The enzymes can perforate the cell membrane of an invader so he \"bleeds out\" intracellular fluid or they may inject chemicals to poison it. \n\nAll those B cells that went ham earlier are now pumping out buttloads of antibodies. Those antigens from before that were markers for the enemy the phagocyte was wearing around? Well if that was a lock an antibody would be the key.\n\nThe antibodies flood through your system like hooligans through the streets after a soccer game and every fan of the opposing team gets doled out some mob justice. They only work for that specific antigen though. They bind to it, releasing antitoxins to stop any nasty shit the thing may be releasing.\n\nMuch like a grown man in a pee-wee league football game, the pathogen keeps going with all these little fuckers sticking to it and that makes it slow and a pretty easy target for phagocytes to devour.

{"body": "Scot here I don't think I will ever struggle to understand any dialect of English. I'm from Glasgow (where these 2 are from) but I have a well spoken accent as I work in sales I kind of have to. When I go to leeds or Manchester or London or anywhere it is a bloody nightmare. I think it is more laziness and ignorance. Like they need to point out the fact that you are not from there. the amount of times you hear \"you wot\" when trying to check into hotels is unbelievable go into a shop and they are like oh my god you are soo Scottish in a whiney smug accent. My friend was at an English festival and he said there was a Marlborough stand that only sold Marlborough cigarettes and it still took him 10 minutes of pointing and speaking slowly just for them to decipher what colour and size of pack they are looking for. Like can you not tell instantly? 20 lights sounds the same in any accent. The one benefit you do have being from Glasgow is switching the accent on and off people don't mess with you. In Newcastle some chav walking directly towards me with his head down as I was smoking outside a hotel. Like \"here mate you got a few quid\" look directly at him switch it on \"naw mate how\" dude stopped in his tracks and started chatting to me about Newcastle and how good it is for a night out haha shut that one down pretty quickly. Anyway my point is that if you just follow body language listen intently you can pretty much understand them no matter where their from.
