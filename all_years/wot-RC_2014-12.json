Not everyone has a GC controller, and its not fair to those who don't, especially if you consider yourself even a somewhat serious player, playing against casuals. Sure C-stick allows you to maintain momentum for things like Jiggly's air attacks, but it makes an already uneven playing field even more uneven. The unspoken rule here isn't about C-sticks, its about trying to keep the field even. At least that's what it was to my group during Brawl.\n\n3. U Wot M8? Seriously? This is insanity. This is core to the game, and core to winning. If you're not good at edge guarding then you should improve. This has nothing to do with an unfair advantage.\n\n4. I don't really know about on high, but if you're playing without items you're really missing the spirit with which the game was developed. Random chance (items) allows less skilled players to win sometimes, which ultimately makes the game more fun for everyone, its part of game theory. If the most skilled player at a game always wins then its becomes hard to attract new players, and the less skilled players will never have fun and eventually quit. To turn off items in a casual or semi-casual environment with anything but extremely experienced players is asking for a bad time, and honestly a bit selfish.\n\n5. This hardly makes any sense if they're not trying to be competitive. Friends and I play on 4 stock, but we always play with as many people as possible. 1v1 implies a competitive environment.

{"body": "Well let's look at a company who did a similar thing with their games.\n\nCD Projekt RED released the Witcher, and then later on they released an Enhanced Edition which featured:  \n* over 200 new animations, additional NPC models and recoloring of generic NPC models as well as monsters  \n* vastly expanded and corrected dialogues in translated versions, improved stability, redesigned inventory system and load times reduced by roughly 80%  \n* game manual completely overhauled  \n* two new adventures available to play through: Side Effects and The Price of Neutrality.  \n* A new option is to mix and match ten different languages of voice and subtitles  \n\nLater on of course they released the Witcher 2 and did the exact same thing, with the Enhanced Edition adding over 10GB of new content, including four hours of gameplay, thirty-six minutes of cinematics including a new intro and outro, and a host of fixes to gameplay and the interface.\n\nThe existing owners of the original versions of both games received a free upgrade to the Enhanced Edition.\n\nFrom and Bamco obviously have a right to charge for the work they have put into the new version of the game. But considering the pre-release footage we saw of DS2, I think it's quite clear that this was something they had already been working on but couldn't release due to the limitations of the previous generation console hardware. To add insult to injury they explicitly stated that they were bringing these changes to the new consoles because they were more powerful, and us PC users are standing here going \"You wot mate\".\n\nA bunch of AAA titles I can think of allow you to run the game in either DX9 or later with no problems in save game compatibility.

The graphical improvements are minor. Fair enough if they originally released the game with better graphic capabilities on PC than on PS3 or 360 (which they did).

{"body": "There's some exciting research going on right now regarding [\"Deterministic Compilation\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1180852/deterministic-builds-under-windows).  Basically, right now, if I send you some source code and you compile it, you'll get an exe file, and then if I compile it on my machine, I'll get an exe file, but our exe's will be slightly different.\n\nSo if our exes are different, how can you trust that I didn't change the source code slightly?  Maybe even nefariously?  That's a big problem in the open source world, because even though the source code is available to everyone, realistically very few people will take the time to compile it themselves.  They'll almost always just grab someone else's exe file and run it.\n\nSo the scary part is, imagine an open source programmer who gains the trust of everyone, and provides exe files for all of his projects.  Whenever people want to use his projects, they go and download his exe's.  But what guarantee do we have that his exe is doing the same thing as what the source code says it should do?  No guarantee at all! :(  In fact, it's depressingly easy for a project maintainer to slip in some extra code.  All they have to do is take the existing source code, make some changes (like adding some \"hidden features\"), compile it, and then upload those exe's and say \"Yeah, these exes are genuine!  They've been compiled from that source code tree!\" even though the exe is malicious.  No one would probably ever find out, and not even the best antivirus would detect such underhandedness.\n\nThat's why the idea of \"deterministic builds\" are so exciting.  Deterministic builds means that if you compile some source code, and I compile some source code, we'll both end up with an identical exe.  Every single byte will match.  Which means it's *guaranteed* that we're running the same code.  You can know that my exe is clean since it's identical to your exe, which you compiled yourself.  So, theoretically, if Dr. Evil Programmer tried to sneak in some extra functionality into their Offical Exe's, people would notice, because you'd compile the codebase and end up with a totally different exe and say \"hey wtf, u fokkin wot m8 ill rek ye\" until he explains the discrepancies.\n\nUnfortunately, deterministic builds are still very much \"research,\" not \"reality,\" because in practice it's incredibly difficult.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417466723", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[](/sbahjgoddamn) this is a lot of stuff and I'm sorry about that. Still, here are my suggestions.\n\n~~Christ God in Heaven you know I like to make up exclamations (Christ in a casket is that weird or what).~~\n\nThe Strokes. I love the shit out of 'em. If you want me to do a shitty cover, I can do a shitty ass cover of one of their songs (a la how do I live without you). I don't know where I'll get the microphone, but we'll make this happen.\n\nSmoking. I love all forms of (not smokeless) tobacco: cigarettes, cigars, pipes. But I favor the first. Dipping is nasty (even smokers have standards). If that one doesn't stick, I *completely* understand. I *will* say that it's funny to have all of t hat burning stuff around so much paper.\n\n~~Tablets (like the kindle). I hate 'em. I prefer a good old-fashioned, real, tangible book to the cold and unfeeling tablet. I can never work the damn things anyway. Though I do *consider* them briefly when I learn how heavy a spellbook can be.~~\n\nWeed, Montage Parodies. I think they're ironically hilarious. It's part of my weird sense of humor. I can't post these sorts of things from a work computer (It'd seriously mess with my job security and my co-workers' ability to surf the web if I got our internet blocked... *again*), but look up things like Nichijoint and Weed Circulation to get an idea of the weed stuff. Any montage parody will do for the latter. Particularly things featuring the phrases, \"git rekt skrub\" \"git gud\" and \"u wot m8\" will do. I'd2 probably8 have4 to break5 the typing6 quirk5 for that4 one3 but3 it'd3 be2 so2 worth5.\n\n~~I start taking off my glasses when I don't think I need them because another character tells me I look better without 'em. I then realize that that shit is dumb, and start wearing 'em again; glasses are sexy *as hell*, I'm proud of the fact that I wear them, and I'm too damn lazy for contacts.~~\n\n~~Favorite book is 1Q84, by Haruki Murakami. It was gripping, and love stories are the sort of thing I love anyway (no pun intended). If you need more info on that book, please feel free to ask.~~ \n\n~~I live with my parents and sister, and my dad owns a **shit ton** of guns. I own one myself, and keep it captchalogued; it was a gift from my father. I offer to put the captcha codes out for anyone who wants them (having assigned bookkind as my strife specibus, I don't really have much need or desire to use them), but no one takes me up on it, so I leave them with my home. Again: I *totally* understand if this one doesn't stick. It kind of feels weird to me.~~\n\n~~I swear profusely, despite my cultured appearance and nervous nature.~~\n\nI stress easily, locking up under pressure, and shy away from responsibility. Part of my arc is growing out of that and becoming a man, just like my father always wanted (don't hate on my home life; I love my folks). \n\nI actually make attempts to write hard-boiled fiction of my own after PS2 comes out, and go through a phase where I fashion myself to be a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes (a character like that should actually probably be in PS2; a contrast to Problem Sleuth himself, and perhaps a Dr. Watson character is in order, as a contrast to Ace Dick or Pickle Inspector).\n\n~~Even at 21, I still cry every few months, when the stress gets to be too bad. I gotta tell you, there's nothing quite as nice as a good cry.~~ \n\n~~I have a distaste for alcohol, and rarely overdo it. Sometimes I do. When I overdo it, *damn* do I overdo it. Again, I understand if this one doesn't stick. I have *no clue* how PG you want this story to be.~~\n\nI think that's about it. I'm gonna go back and apologize for the wall of text, but I wanted to get all my ideas out in one comment, rather than a whole bunch of 'em. Let me know if you need clarification, or if you want me to isolate a couple of ideas in their own comment for easier access.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417467305", "subreddit": "squiddlediddlers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Very quickly, I'd just like to apologize for my hostility in the last post. I've been arguing with someone who genuinely angers me and my patience just ran thin. \n\n&gt;My main point was that your example was of 2 completely different fields, and was all around illogical. Communication and brain wave/mater manipulation are at least related fields.\n\nNow I'm sure this makes sense to you, but I need you to understand that it's still wrong. Less so, but my example wasn't meant to be an apples-to-apples comparison. While they may be the same field, they're vastly different focuses research-wise. Also, matter manipulation falls under chemistry. \n\n&gt;It is a theoretical of if we had the capability to raise the cognitive abilities of animals (in this case mice) would we be morally obligated to do so?\n\nOP is asking a loaded question. The changes he proposes wouldn't \"increase\" their cognitive capabilities. Saying it's an \"improvement\" is a very egocentric way of looking at things (again, by using humans as some sort of standard other animals should be held to). \n\n&gt; As for a biological supremacy, we live longer, \n\nTardigrades and turtles can live for over a century and a half. We're not special.\n\n&gt;, take hundreds of millions (maybe more) of their lives a year,\n\nYou call that superiority? They're still around in spite of that. Imagine if hundreds of millions of humans died a year. \n\n&gt; and are already adept at using tools.\n\nSo? Mice don't need tools to live. If anything, they have an advantage over you because they don't need to waste time and energy looking for useless constructs to live. \n\n&gt;The fact that humans are already more cognitively (and over all mentally) developed than mice is simply not arguable.\n\nAgain, very ego-centric. What you're effectively saying is \"People are better at being people than mice. That means we're better in general.\" Who cares if a scarcely-haired monkey wrapped up in its own little world can solve a puzzle made by a second one? And why should the mouse care if it's slower at it than said monkeys? \n\n&gt;We wouldn't be their life line, but their eradicators.\n\nNo we wouldn't. You can't drive mice to extinction. Attempting to do so would be only slightly less insane than trying to exterminate cockroaches.  We have no incentive to kill them off, nor do I know where you get the idea that we would find one any time soon. \n\n&gt;Now imagine one side was a completely different species and they had no way of communicating with each other. Chances it would not be a peaceful coexistence.\n\nIt's mice, not Formics. We're not going to world wars 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6 because your hypothetical people-mice can't talk to people-humans. \n\n&gt;Communication at its very core is an interpretation of brain signals.\n\nU wot m8? \n\n&gt;n order to increase the cognitive capacities of an animal, it stands to reason we would have to have a way to measure cognitive capabilities with high accuracy.\n\nYou realize our way of \"measuring cognitive capacities\" is to make animals take people tests, right?

The comment is now deleted (by him) and kare9 was [banned for a week](http://i.imgur.com/JyQEmCt.jpg) for which his cup of salt floweth over.\n\nHe then dug himself into a pit by posting [this](http://i.imgur.com/iHLffqQ.jpg) for which we made the initially temporary week-long ban into a permanent one. kare9 [still apparently wants it](http://i.imgur.com/DbJT5Vn.jpg) despite what he said earlier, but because he's an intolerable cunt, we don't want him.\n\nSo that's the story.

{"body": "You want to restrict media ownership, ergo, you're more fascistic than I. See, thing about me is: I'm ultimately a liberal. I have very illiberal views - notably concerning Islam and Muslim immigration, but ultimately I come back down to: leave everybody alone to do what they please, so long as they're not harming people. You, however, want to say that person x can only own [insert arbitrary percentage] of the media. How about - and this is a novel concept, I know; but do consider it! The state can't tell you what you can and can't say, what you can and can't own - provided you're not hurting somebody. So what if Rupert Murdoch owns shit tons of papers and a cheeky bit of Sky? Who cares? Why do lefties have this ridiculous notion of false consciousness? People don't just look at x paper and take it at face value; not most people anyway. Do you want different views to get out there? Then the internet's brilliant for this. All sorts of groups can start up, look at blogs like left food forward, liberal conspiracy, breitbart and conservativehome. There's nothing stopping this. You can crowd fund organizations like this. What I take exception to is: restrictions on others. No! Just let everybody do as they please. This argument about a functioning democracy vis-a-vis media concentration is outdated in the age of twitter and google - even if there ever was any semblance of respect to it. Look at you and I now, both passionately disagreeing about idealogical issues. You see this on the margins of the left and the right, lefties think people are stupid or immoral and need to be educated, rightists thinking that everybody else is a traitor or in on some grand conspiracy. It's ridiculous. Just set up your own blog, get all sorts to contribute to it. Whollah! A socialist platform - and in the age of the internet, anybody can read it. You don't win the battle of ideas by saying person x can only have so much airtime - you do it by convincing people of your principles and your ideas. I happen to think greens can do this, but they really do need to shed the authoritarianism if they want to generate mass appeal. Best argument for liberalism? Humans are shitty.

{"body": "There's nothing wrong with getting a bow and doing some shooting outside. For people in areas without archery clubs, this is normal and many people do it.\n\nWhat's wrong is your approach.\n\nYou're not doing \"heavy research\", unless you count \"Tell me what to buy\" and \"Eh, whatever, I'll pick this one\" as doing heavy research. You stand out from other people getting into the sport because you're not actually asking about how to get into archery. All you said was \"I wanna get a longbow\" and \"where can I get one that isn't shit\" so you can \"shoot shit outside\".\n\nYou're impossible to help. I don't mean this to put you down, but you are the hardest kind of person to work with from the perspective of a club or a store. You're fixated on \"I want a bow. I'm getting this bow\". Normally, we'd establish things like why you want to get into archery, what style of archery you are interested in, what your budget is, what equipment you need to be ready to shoot, and so on; and that's so that you make the most appropriate choice for your ability level and for maximum enjoyment.\n\nYou walk into a store and say \"I want a longbow that isn't shit\", and the person behind the counter isn't exactly going to find that helpful. Furthermore, the same attitude fires off lines like \"What're the cheapest arrows?\" and \"Finger tab? Nah mate, I'm fine\". In the end, they're going to sell you shit items just to get you out of the store faster.\n\nNotice the downvotes? If you're genuine about getting into archery, you're not going to show the \"u wot m8?\" attitude. Show some respect to the sport and people might actually take the time to help you.\n\nI actually recommend that you contact a store and ask them about getting a bow, and walk through the process of what you need. That's pretty much what they're there for. It's better than getting random people on the internet firing random recommendations at you that you randomly pick from.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417699066", "subreddit": "Archery", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I leveled a resto druid to 100 and am having fun with it, especially because I can now glyph to have tree form again :)\n\nIf you think you might be persuaded to go horde, my husband and I run a guild called &lt;Grimm Order&gt; on Turalyon, Horde side. Like you guys, we were really into WoW and casual/social raiding thru WotLK and then missed most of Cata and MoP due to lack of interest along with work/school commitments. \n\nWe're pretty much looking for people that want to be part of a close-knit group (meaning, a guild that actually does stuff together instead of just solo queuing dungeons in LFD) and enjoy hanging out in guild chat or on Mumble. Being chill, mature, and not offended by dick jokes are pretty much all musts, lol. \n\nWe also do raiding on Fridays &amp; Saturdays, 9-12pm EST if you're interested. We're sticking to normal/flex modes and know that RL stuff will sometimes be more important than WoW. We're mainly looking for DPS and maybe another healer but could probably find room for any role.\n\nAnyway, if you think you might be interested hit me up on battle.net (Zylle#1136) and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have! :D", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417732939", "subreddit": "wowguilds", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Overly heavy breathing nerd rant inbound...\n\nOkay, at first I was completely okay with having to relevel up my exotics. Felt it was slightly shady that it resets my progress as I've already maxed out a LOT of my exotics but whatever, I'll deal with it. \n\nI have a great deal more free time than others. I have played enough to get one of character of each class to level 30 via ONLY raid gear. I've earned *at least* one of every drop available from the VoG. What was next on my \"to do\" list to keep myself entertained? Why go Pokemon style on the exotics of course and \"catch 'em all\". So far in my ~650 hours of play time (fuck you, I go outside, don't hate on my LED screen tan) I have managed to obtained 33 of the 36 exotics available on my platform. Of those 27 of them are fully maxed out.\n\nSure I was a bit sad that all that time was for nothing because trading them in for their better versions is going to reset all that progress and time spent upgrading them to begin with. The thought of needing to save up 231 strange coins and 231,000 glimmer makes me cringe a bit, but I was doing my best to \"just deal with it\".\n\n**BUT THEN**... then Deej confirmed that any **vanilla** exotics received after the DLC drops will NOT need to be \"reXurbished\". \n\nSAY FUCKING WOT M8?!\n\nWhy? Why go through the trouble of implementing this rather complicated system (from a coding standpoint) that is only going to be used by a portion of your players (however small or large a portion is irrelevant, point is, not everyone) and *even then* it's only going to be used for a few months (if that) until all of the old exotics that **active** players want to upgrade have been upgraded. Seems likely an awfully big waste of some game programmer's time to implement something so temporary.\n\nI have defended this game and IT'S DEVELOPERS since fucking launch. I have invested all of my 'no-life' free time into this game. I have convinced several of my friends to purchase this game and play with me. I have even convinced SOME of my friends to buy a new fucking console to get the better experience that current gen brings to the table (it's not fucking \"next gen\" anymore, it's here, now. There's only current gen and last gen). What does Bungie give me for all my nerdy little efforts? A big ol' middle finger in the form of a SHIT LOAD more time needed to be spent in game to grind glimmer and strange coins (and waiting around for Xur to sell the right fucking upgrade) meanwhile, all the Christmas blueberries are gunna roll in and be like \"Y U cri? That wasn't so hard to get!\"\n\n**TLW**\n\nFUCKING... [YAAARGH!](http://youtu.be/PbcctWbC8Q0)\n\n... Alright, I've spoken my piece. To those of you who actually read it all, thank you.

Ai luat in brate ideea ca eu ii suflu-n cur lu' Putin, sau whatever the fuck are you thinking (i really don't know), si ai dat-o inainte. Premisa ta e gresita, my dearest. E normal ca si concluzia ta sa fie gresita. \n\n&gt; Faptul ca te-am contrazis si ti-am zis ca ai un argument prost nu ignora realitatile vietii. \n\nErm. Again, nu m-ai contrazis pe mine. Te-ai contrazis pe tine, te-ai certat singura cu o idee preconceputa de-a ta. Nu am un argument prost, pentru ca nu am argumente. Nu impun absolut nimic, nimanui. \n\n&gt; Si actually toate problemele care au dus la situatii de cacat in the first place au fost aduse de oameni care au ignorat logica.\n\nNu, au fost aduse de oameni care s-au gandit doar la binele lor.\n\n&gt; And that's bad, and that's why we should inform ourselves and learn more about logic.\n\nSigur, de acord cu tine. Dar atata timp cat \"the bad guys\" nu o sa asculte de logica, it's useless to me.\n\n&gt; Problema e ca gandesti exact ca el and you don't even know it. Si oamenii ca tine sun periculosi pentru tara.\n\nI know it, si am si zis-o (dar ti-a scapat), ca as face tot ce imi sta in putinta sa imi servesc tara. Avem unele convingeri echivalente, true. Asta nu inseamna ca, daca as avea ocazia, as rade ungurii de pe fata pamantului sau as invada Rep. Moldova. Asta iti scapa tie. Dar e ok. Iti ziceam mai demult, tu (si alti cativa de aici) faceti parte din \"the new world\". In care domina toleranta si intelegerea si respectul si, nu-i asa, pe primul loc - logica. Problema e ca nu faci treaba cu \"uneltele\" astea. Istoria omenirii dovedeste treaba asta, ca nu ne putem depasi cacaturile... lanturile. Si de aia, oameni ca voi nu vor schimba niciodata nimic. Not really. Vor fugi de conflicte, si vor pune logica deasupra a tot ce e uman. Sigur, ar fi frumos ca logica sa fie ceva uman... imi place ideea aia, dar nu e asa. \n\nUite, hai sa luam cazul Churchill. Stii ca Hitler i-a propus un pact de neagresiune pe la inceputul razboiului. Ce ar fi dictat logica? Sa accepte acel pact, sa salveze vieti, nu? Dar mosul a ales altceva. To honor Britain's promise to Poland. To crush the bad guy. The greater good. The greater fucking good, my dearest. De aia pentru mine logica nu se aplica to the really real world, and to the really real people.\n\nTe respect pentru convingerile tale si te admir. I swear on me mum's grave, nu te ironizez. Dar oameni care au folosit logica au existat din Grecia antica, si they barely made a difference. Daca vrei sa se ajunga la lumea aia la care visez si eu, unde logica primeaza, nu vei ajunge acolo logic.

It's happened countless times throughout history. Technology can be used for a lot, and is.\n\n\n&gt; Everything in this space has revolved around scams, schemes and deceit. \n\nIs this just hyperbole, or are you trying to make a real point?

Boom, owned.\n\n\n&gt;The biggest conflict of interest in bitcoin is the exact reason why no mass user adoption exists.\n\n\nA year ago, people were still arguing that Bitcoin won't work because \"21 million coins isn't enough for billions of people\" - I'm sure there are countless people who *still* think this is an insurmountable problem and that the lack of units would prohibit the network from functioning. And yet you're saying that the only reason mass user adoption hasn't taken place (yet) is not some complex function involving widespread misunderstanding, lack of infrastructure, overall systemic complexity... but some boiled-down bullet point that doesn't take any of this into account.\n\njenniferlawrenceokay.gif\n\n&gt;Whenever productive individuals in the bitcoin space create surplus value that benefits the eco system, the value of a bitcoin increases. ~~Large hoarders~~ All owners of bitcoin are able to ~~steal~~ benefit from this new purchasing power without having to do anything. That is the magic of deflation.\n\nAll holders of bitcoin benefit proportionally to the size of their holdings. There's no magic threshold like \"If you have less than 100 BTC you won't get any deflationary benefits\" like you're implying here. It's not just \"large hoarders\" - it's **everyone**. \n\nYou are so, so fucking stupid.\n\n&gt;The original value creator may not see any reward whatsoever.\n\n...unless they hold Bitcoin, in which case they benefit accordingly...\n\n...or unless their \"surplus value creation\" mechanism also happens to generate revenue, which is, you know, how businesses work...\n\n&gt;This has been a problem of capitalism ever since it was forcefully imposed on the english speaking world in the 17th century. Who gets the surplus value that is created by productive individuals?\n\nThis isn't a \"problem\" - this is a feature. Capitalism incents value creation because you want to reap the fruits of your labor, so you labor accordingly.\n\n&gt;Bitcoin has an answer. ~~Large hoarders who believe sterile digits are someohow productive should reap the rewards.~~ The entire ecosystem, proportionally according to the size of their holdings.\n\nHow many sentences am I going to have to correct? Every single one, apparently.\n\n&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin stash swelled in value from the transfer of purchasing power from others.\n\nAs the creator of the entire thing, that seems perfectly fair and just.\n\n&gt;The early hoarders who now control up to 80% of all coins, simply sit back and let the naive army of idiots make them rich.\n\nWho controls bitcoins? Oh, right, the people who believe in the system enough not to sell their coins (which would decrease demand and increase available supply), i.e. those who give those coins the value in the first place.\n\n&gt;no state or coercive actor is able to force people onto bitcoin\n\nOh, my. This is somehow a *bad* aspect of Bitcoin? That sounds like a good thing to me.\n\n&gt; ~~Bitcoiners~~ People are so enamored with a lust for wealth they are completely blinded to the scams they fall for.\n\nThis is not something unique to Bitcoiners, as bad as you want it to be. It's \"human nature\" and it's something you should probably get used to.\n\n&gt;With a lack of a moral compass, no defense mechanism exists for the bitcoiners.\n\nu wot m8?\n\nDid you just say \"Every single person who owns Bitcoin lacks a moral compass\" and mean it? That's naive beyond words. Are you misogynistic and racist too? I would not be surprised at all.\n\n&gt;Nobody will voluntarily join a monetary system based on artificial scarcity where few hands own almost all the money, forcing everyone else to exchange real wealth for it.\n\nExcept for the millions who already have, you mean? You're arguing \"Starting at this arbitrary point in time (now), no one *new* will join in on the thing\", surely? Otherwise this is provably false. Just stop by /r/Bitcoin and see thousands of people who have joined the monetary system you describe.\n\nAlso, the objection against \"a monetary system based on artificial scarcity where few hands own almost all the money\" applies just as well to the US Dollar.\n\nIt sounds to me like you're saying \"Without violence, how can Bitcoin compete against currencies that have violent actors forcing their usage.\" Which is sort of weird and not something to take pride in.\n\n\nIf you have a moment, please let me know how it feels to be completely and utterly eviscerated.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417811944", "subreddit": "Buttcoin", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

He'd rather experiment with 10,000 different new ideas than make 1 hyper-super-mega-ultra OP one based off of proven stuff. But, as we've seen, he will do it if the world depends on it.\n\nThats what the bleeding edge armor is, and it isn't nearly on the phoenix buster level. \n\n&gt;Oh yeah! Say no more! It's all coming back now. It's funny, I just realized, I actually had this exact same argument with Ame-no-nobuko at one point, and I once had a similar one with RageEx2 where I took your side (not against Tony, but someone). Funny how the world works.\n\n&gt;Ok, so he's about low herald tier, correct?\n\nLmao, I don't remember unfortunately. I think thats probably fair. The problem with the hellbat suit though, is seriously dude its fookin absurd. So far it has not been stopped by ANYTHING, and I mean anything. He took Kalibak down in like 3 hits and was wrecking parademons and other apokolips stuff. Darkseid shows up at the end and he's like \"bout time you showed up\". So yeah come Batman and Robin 37 we'll know better. \n\n&gt;Odinforce Thor is low/mid skyfather. He's right above Thanos' level. In fact, Odinforce Thor after being given time to adjust to the Odinforce eventually surpasses Odin. But, yeah, the Odinforce Thor that Tony fought was about low skyfather.\n\nYes but the thorbuster suit was only possible because of that crystal. Tony says it himself, he's like \"all the energy you throw at me gets absorbed and redirected back at you\", the whole entire suit runs off it. Its not 100 percent fair to use it as Stark's highest showing, just like the Hellbat isn't Bruce's. \n\n&gt;True, to an extent, but all physical blows taken by Tony weren't changed at all. It takes some pretty insane durability to tank even one hit from a low skyfather, much less 20 or so.\n\nI dunno, from the bits I've seen and from the thorbuster wiki it looks like the crystal is responsible for a whole lot. Check it out http://marvel.wikia.com/Iron_Man_Armor_Model_23\n\nI dunno, I don't know enough about Ironman I feel.

{"body": "What we've spent on something in the past doesn't matter, all that matters is what it's worth now and in the future. But people don't always think rationally like this.\n\nLet's say there are 2 hotels you are considering staying in for a specific night:\n\n* Hotel 1 is in Leeds and costs $50 a night. this is your preference. right next to the legendary Leeds casino and a two-minute walk from the mighty Leeds United training ground. \n\n* Hotel 2 is actually /u/berryguns house, and costs $100 a night. his house smells worse than Phil Laak after a 72-hour session. \n\nBoth hotels have you pay in advance with Dogecoin, and you obviously prefer Hotel 1. After a drunk session of spin-n-gos, you attempt to ship Hotel 1 the $50 in Dogecoin, but you misclick and accidentally ship it to /u/berryguns for Hotel 2! He refuses to refund you like a cheeky cunt, claiming \"it's just banter m8\". However, he will let the $50 count towards the cost of staying at his house. So now you have two choices:\n\n1. You can pay $50 for Hotel 1 in Leeds\n\n2. You can send BerryGuns the remaining $50 to stay at Hotel 2\n\nFrom an economist's point of view, this is a no-brainer. The two options are equally expensive, and you greatly prefer Hotel 1. So if people were to act rationally, they would always choose option 1. \n\nHowever, people often choose option 2 in this situation due to what's known as the \"sunk-cost bias\". They think that because they've already paid $50 for Hotel 2, it would be a waste to not stay there. But in reality, the $50 you drunkenly shipped is a \"sunk-cost\". The cost has already been paid and it cannot be recovered. We should only make our decisions based upon the future costs and future benefits of our choices (both options now will cost the same but option 1 will provide more benefit).\n\nAnother example is if your parents have spent $10,000 a semester on college tuition for 7 semesters, and you're thinking about dropping out with 1 semester left to complete. The $70,000 already paid in tuition is completely irrelevant to your decision to stay in school. If you realize the present value of your art history degree is only $5000, then it would be -EV to stay in school. The relevant pieces of information are the current/future costs of $10,000 and the current/future benefit of $5,000. The sunk cost of $70,000 is irrelevant. \n\nedit: technically it's not the \"future\" cost or benefit but the present value of the future cost/benefit, but I'm ignoring discounting for simplicity's sake\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417946611", "subreddit": "poker", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Again, let's assume women earn less income than men entirely because of free choice.\n\nNo need for assumptions. I've shown you data heavily suggesting that it's the case. \n\n&gt;The system produces fewer female CEOs. Why? It produces fewer female reps in Congress. Why? Are women choosing not to be CEOs? Are women choosing not to be reps in Congress?\n\nWell, for one, sociopathy is needed to take on a lot of these positions. As for the CEO thing, pregnancy is a factor. At no point do we pretend the corporate world is some kind of meritocracy, but you don't help yourself by working fewer hours than your male counterparts, getting pregnant, taking leave, then coming back and working fewer hours still, if you come back at all. Not to mention (anecdote warning) [women make the decision to earn less fairly consciously](http://youtu.be/1ASTL_jq1q4?t=10m1s). \n\n&gt;But does this mean we should look at income inequality by gender as just?\n\nWhen it's the result of people's choices, we should. \n\n&gt;Black Americans earn less than white Americans. Is this also by choice? Some, and I am not at all suggesting you are among them, would say it is by choice\n\nActually, no. [Data suggests that generational poverty is at play in these cases](http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ksg.harvard.edu%2Finequality%2FSeminar%2FPapers%2FJencks.pdf&amp;date=2008-01-04). Look, we're all friends here. No need to strawman me to make a point. If you don't know what I think about something, just ask. I'll gladly explain. \n\n&gt;So when it comes to women, there too is a system that goes back a very long time. Our society is built differently for men than it is for women. There are different expectations involved even, and differences in perception.\n\nYes. That's how societies work. That's not a bad thing. Men are expected to do different things than women. If we weren't sexually dimorphic, this wouldn't be a thing. But we are, so it is. \n\n&gt;If in your mother's womb, your mother's food intake was restricted, it would be easier for you for your whole life, to put on weight than those who weren't hungry in the womb, because you were programmed to be hungry.\n\nU wot m8?\n\n&gt;So whereas a libertarian viewpoint might be that overweight people are overweight by choice, because of choosing to eat more and worse,\n\nWell it's true. Barring the case of the poor, who are paradoxically fat and undernourished, as unhealthy food is their only option, leaving their bodies craving nutrients long after it received the necessary calories. If you have a choice in what you eat, a real choice, it's your fault you're fat.  No getting around it. \n\n&gt;I think it's this kind of more expansive look we need to take on things. Systems cannot be understood from inside them. We have to step outside of them. Concluding that women earn less than men because of free choice is to me, looking at the system from inside it. Stepping outside of it requires us looking at why these choices are made, and just how much free choice is actually involved in the systemic outcomes we see around us.\n\nLook, I'm all for addressing injustices in a system, [like the fact that women receive dramatically lighter punishment for the same crimes](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002), but your princess is in another castle.

{"body": "&gt;How would positive results benefit from further verification?\n\nAny errors in the work can be found and corrected. \n\n&gt; If that research can be built upon, the next lab to use it must necessarily confirm it as a basis of the next experiment, so no additional funds are necessary as long as funding goes to the new progress\n\nSomeone on this post said it's probably cheaper to verify results than the original experiment. If that's the case, it seems like there would be savings of time and money if a positive result is refuted. \n\n&gt; What do you think money is going towards besides progress based on previous work?\n\nThere's been a misunderstanding. I didn't mean where it's going towards in the current budget. I meant in my hypothetical scenario. The money would go from more research, to confirmation work. What I meant to say is it wouldn't be diverted to buy margarita machines or anything like that, but rather something equally, if not more, important. \n\n&gt;You're working off the assumption that a much larger proportion of science is lies that go unnoticed than actually is.\n\nU wot m8? \n\n&gt; Very few people waste time publishing negative results because labs talk amongst themselves and have previous members from different places who have records of projects that aren't even published.\n\nGood for them. You sort of miss the part where the information is better off being published for the world to see. \n\n&gt;Some labs have twenty postdocs working on twenty different projects with only three publishing in any given year, and talk amongst everyone at all levels to say why different projects aren't panning out.\n\nYeah, that's not very helpful to anyone. Having someone tell you about their work is very different than reading their paper and dissecting it in an attempt to replicate. \n\n&gt;Basically, in the eyes of a scientist: this isn't the problem you think it is.\n\nWhat do you think I think it is? Because you make some very worrying statements here and there and I need to know. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418016982", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

Though I originally downloaded it with the intention of making an AAR of the Liverpoolite Empire under the U Wot dynasty, I've since changed my focus to Russia after I realized that their counties all had really detailed coat of arms compared to everywhere else. This has led to my two current playthroughs, Vyazma with their flag of something that won't be invented for 500 years, and the glorious Norse Vitebsk- who shall set fire to all of Christendom in the name of Thor and under the flag of [Viking Jesus](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/194/6/9/coat_of_arms_of_vitebsk_by_korivka-d574p4n.png) (I just started it yesterday so sadly I don't have any screen shots yet).

{"body": "Each game had its own benefit for me. I don't know if it was just the initial transition to 3d but I fell in love with Kalos as a region and had an amazing time straight to the end, I couldn't get enough. The camera work and design of zones felt like a great evolution for the series.\n\nIn ORAS I loved the updates, and I was also reminded of just how massive a region Hoenn is. Maybe its that I don't have a lot of free time, but it takes me FOREVER to explore. Each new town leaves you woth this sprawling open world feeling because you can explore a little bit of multiple routes and by the time I was around Mauville and could explore the city and go all these new places,, plant berries everywhere, and also fight Team Aqua, I was overwhelmed with content. The routes get SO HUGE as the game progresses that my limited schedule had me taking multiple days in between towns. I love the immersion of this, but its a drag sometimes. Hoenn has the WORST Pokedex with NO variety, so coming out of Kalos's 10+ new pokemon per route to have zigzagoon and wingull on every route made all the exploration pointless. I had a million places to go and nothing to look for in any of them except the same exact 5 or so secret base designs.\n\nKalos was gorgeous, but except for the road to the second gym, exploration was brief and linear, which was a shame. Hoenn is massive in the best way, but is limited by a ridiculous number of HMs and a horrible selection of Pokemon.\n\nAny complaints about difficulty apply to both, but honestly ORAS felt easier. The routes were so Lon that even with experience share off I was gaining tons of levels. Why did every team admin have 1 Pokemon? The enemies were so easy it actually harmed my immersion in the game.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418234670", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "___\n\n**Cimbrean Colony, The Far Reaches**\n\n“Fookin’ ‘ell, they’re coming in pretty hard…”\n\nThe *Sanctuary* was hammering down at the core of a trail of plasma. Powell and all the rest ducked down against a sudden blast of air, and the whole colony shook as the ship extended its fields, pancaking the air below it into a hundred-meter tall cushion that shoved the fireball sideways, scything the top off some nearby trees.\n\n“*Jesus H. Tittyfuckin’ Christ!!*” Legsy yelled, a sentiment echoed in assorted vulgarities from all across the camp.\n\nThrumming smugly, *Sanctuary* settled gently onto the landing field.\n\n“The fook was that all about?” Powell demanded, as the ramp dropped and Kirk’s partner-in-crime, Julian, staggered out and sat down heavily.\n\n“The camouflage field working?” he asked.\n\n“Franklin! Camo the field!” Powell yelled at the SEAL whose job was to handle the colony’s forcefield. \n\n“On it!”\n\nThe field shimmered, moving from optimal collection mode to a wide-effect digital camo that would, in theory, make the colony very difficult to see from orbit.\n\nJulian stood up. “There’s a ship incoming.” he explained.\n\nThe trooper responsible for the colony’s sensor array - really just the feed from a number of stealthy micro-satellites in geosynchronous orbit - had already grabbed his gear before Powell could turn to shout him into action, and was busy checking it.\n\n“Confirmed.” he called. “One warp signature, incoming at superluminal from outsystem… looks like they’re coming from Celzi space.”\n\nPowell released a frustrated grunt. “Intel said the Alliance was stepping up anti-piracy ops in this sector. If it’s the fucking Russians...” he trailed off, not finishing the thought. If it *was* the Russians, then the whole Cimbrean operation might well be fucked. Moscow’s aligning itself with the Celzi had caused quite the political row back at home where most everybody favoured neutrality in the interstellar conflict. While the Alliance hadn’t been responsible for the Sol quarantine, their condemnation of the enclosure had smacked more of expedient propaganda than actual moral outrage.\n\n“They’re slowing… sublight.” Baker added. “Active ping! We just got scanned.”\n\n“Think they saw anything?”\n\n“Field’s up, camo’s running… At that range, if our gear’s working as advertised, no they didn’t.”\n\n“Good. If this is just a patrol, hopefully they’ll have a look and move on…”\n\nBaker watched his screen for a good minute.\n\n“They’re not.” He decided. “Looks like they’re pulling into low orbit, set to sweep directly over us in… ten mikes.”\n\n“...shit. Okay, get the Skymaster ready.”\n\nJen glanced at the imposing device in the heart of the camp. The “Skymaster” was a repurposed M242 Bushmaster mounted on a complicated gyroscopic base and field emitter array that transformed it into an effective ground-to-orbit weapon. It had been one of the first things the platoon had set up after the forcefield had come online.\n\nAs she watched, it pivoted and swung skywards, aiming into the western sky.\n\n“Nine mikes.” Baker warned. Powell nodded grimly. His face had that same cold, calculating look that Adrian had used to wear in moments of real danger.\n\n“Prepare to active ping.” He ordered. “If we see any sign that they’re hostile, we shoot first and the questions can go fook themselves.”\n\nBaker confirmed the order, then counted down: “Eight thirty.”\n\nJen cleared her throat. “You sure about this?” She asked.\n\n“Sure as I’ll ever be. Baker? Active ping.” \n\nThe sensors specialist nodded, and tapped something on his equipment. He gritted his teeth at what he saw.\n\n“Ah, *shit*, their grav-spike’s up.” he reported\n\nPowell spun and addressed the two men manning the Skymaster. “Gun team! Five rounds, ASX!”\n\n“Five ASX, ready… lock!”\n\n“Fire!”\n\nThe Skymaster thumped. Jen felt it in her chest as the weapon opened a force-field walled tube of vacuum in front of it, into which it fired a round which accelerated away on a warp pulse in a  line of exotic blue radiation. The warp field would collapse scant millimeters from the target’s hull, delivering the round long before the Celzi cruiser could even register that it was under attack. In theory, if the cruiser’s shields were still down while its warp field dissipated, the rounds would strike its hull unimpeded, smashing through the fragile ceramic armour tiles and delivering shaped explosive charges directly to the superstructure.\n\nIf its shields were up… in theory the gun could overwhelm them with sustained fire, but during that time the cruiser might lower its spike and flee, blowing Cimbrean’s cover.\n\nBaker’s report soothed that particular worry. “Target well hit and de-orbiting, but they’re still intact. Communications could still be up.”\n\nPowell set his jaw. “Five more, fire for effect.”\n\n“Five more… Fire!”\n\nThe gun slammed into life again, and Jen felt her heart jump in her chest as five more rounds in as many seconds vanished skywards, pulsing upwards in a streak of blue light.\n\nPowell keyed his radio. “Kirk, get ready to hit orbit an’ fook off, if this all goes to shit we need it reported back to Earth. Jen, you’d best go with him.”\n\n“...Right. Take care of this place, Powell.” Jen said, while Old Jen whimpered objections at her about not abandoning everyone.\n\n“You didn’t even *name* this place!” Powell objected.\n\n“Folctha.” Jen called as she ran. “It’s called Folctha!” \n \nShe jogged behind the slender alien as he cantered across the lawn and scrambled up the *Sanctuary*’s ramp. Julian had sprinted ahead and was already powering up the ship’s kinetics as the door closed.\n\n“We good to go?” He asked.\n\nKirk shook his head, a slow gesture on his long-necked kind. “Not yet. That ship will see us if we take off right now, and its gravity spike is still up, they’ll get a good look at us if we run now. We need to wait until it’s below the horizon.” \n\n“And then?”\n\n“And then we go with plan B I suppose.”\n\n“I hope that’s not the plan B I’m used to…” Old Jen muttered, *sotto voce*. Louder, she asked “What’s plan B?”\n\n“We deploy the system defence field we stole from the Confederacy.” Julian told her.\n\n“An expedient solution, but also a politically awkward one.” Kirk expanded. “It would damage Earth’s reputation and bargaining position. I was instructed that the survival of the colony is more valuable, but…”\n\n“But the fewer pawns we sacrifice the better.” Julian finished.\n\nJen blinked “Somebody stole one of those things for us?” \n\n“Julian did.” Kirk said, a revelation which caused her to re-examine Julian. After his stammering embarrassment at finding her in the bath, she’d pegged him as another Darragh and largely ignored him.\n\n*Stupid of me* she realised, examining him with New Jen’s eye for danger. That earnest, cautious expression had done a good job of hiding the fact that he was fit, strong, and scarred, and clearly a survivor. It was only the slightly pathetic reaction he had to being in the presence of her - of a *woman*, she realised - that had made her dismiss him. Had he been standing with more confidence, she would have had no trouble imagining him stealing hardware like that.\n\nAt least it was a lesson learned harmlessly.\n\n“What’s going on out there, anyway?” She asked, changing the subject.\n___\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418264630", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 87, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "___\n\n**Brick, New Jersey, Earth**\n\n*Did you know, the Corti never dabbled in nuclear fission on anything more than an experimental basis? Three deaths and an event that came alarmingly close to being their own version of Pripyat later, and they abandoned the program and never spoke of it again. I found that interesting. Of course, that was before their eugenics program, and after their intellect had expanded and their compassion had shrivelled, they were well past the point of need to meddle with such comparatively crude science.*\n\n*The Corti who abducted me - do you meditate? You should. I was taken while meditating and did not even notice until I opened my eyes again.*\n\n*Their names were Hvek and Twanri. A mated couple, and as close as the Corti ever come to being head-over-heels in love. Nice enough people, if one overlooked their condescending habit of constantly attempting to impress upon the “lesser species” just how intellectually superior they were. I was not impressed - they had deliberately stolen me to tap me for expertise that they themselves lacked, after all.* \n\n*Oh, don’t get me wrong. Corti schoolchildren would regard the class on radioisotope decay as mundane and boring. But there’s a gulf of difference between academic understanding of what causes nuclear fission to happen, and direct experience and knowledge of what the effects are when it happens uncontrolled. For that, they turned to the human race.* \n\n*We aren’t the only known species to have detonated these weapons, nor to have dabbled in nuclear fission with the safeties off. But we are by far the most intelligent of those races which did so. That’s probably why they spent so much time repeating their obvious mental advantages - insecurity*. \n\n*They chose two of us - myself, and Mikhael, a Ukrainian gentleman who offered guided tours of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. And chose, it must be said, perfectly. You could not have asked for a better pair to give you a complete analysis on both the academic and practical consequences of the aftermath of a nuclear event. Which of course gave us something of a hint as to what we were there to do…*\n\n___\n\nAdams had a secondary role besides manning the forcefield, namely communications, and he called out as something on his own gear beeped.\n\n“They’re hailing.” he reported.\n\nPowell frowned. “Can they escape now?” \n\nBaker shook his head. “No way, that ship’s coming down hard.”\n\n“Fook it. May as well hear the bastards’ last will and fookin’ testaments. Open the line.”\n\nThe voice that came through was clearly Australian and desperate.\n\n“*Attention arseholes! Please stop fucking shooting at us, we are NOT Alliance. I repeat, we are just a pack of poor fucking bastards in honest need of some god damned help.*”\n\nThere was a long, embarrassed pause among the soldiers. Then, Powell leaned forward, took hold of the microphone, and replied:\n\n“Attention ship - Ceasing fire. You are to proceed as follows: Crouch down, tuck your head between your legs, and kiss your arses goodbye. Sorry.”\n\nThere was no response from the radio. The silence on the ground was, eventually, broken by Legsy. “Fucking helpful advice that, sir.” he commented. Several of the men released the laughs they’d been holding back.\n\n“Shut the fook up and get the lads ready to abandon base if we have to.” Powell ordered. “Actually, fook that. Where’s it coming down?”\n\nBaker scratched his head “She’s aiming for... that big lake to the east.”\n\nThe captain glanced at the sensors screen, then grabbed his field binoculars and turned  to face westwards, raising them to his face.\n\nOther heads turned to follow his aim. Some few seconds later, a cloud formation withered and died in the face of incredible heat as the Alliance cruiser wallowed through it.\n\nThe ship was coming in at a shallow angle from low in the western sky, wreathed in smoke and fire as its shields struggled to stay up and ward off the hammering force of atmosphere. As they watched, a flicker and failure robbed the ship of what might have been an engine or something, which peeled off and corkscrewed away toward the south.\n\n“No way is that thing surviving the hit.” somebody opined.\n\n“We’ll check it out anyway, there’s at least one human on board, so we need to ID the body if nowt else.” Powell replied. “Legsy, get the mules and one of the trucks started up, send half the lads out there.”\n\n“Which truck, sir?”\n\n“I don’t fookin’ care! The one with the broken mirror!”\n\nHe keyed his radio. “Oi, Kirk. Hold off on escaping for now. Looks like we’ve got a couple of hours to check and see if owt survived the crash, you may as well unload the colonists.”\n\nThere was a pause, and then the alien’s simulated voice replied with a single professional word: “*Understood.*”\n\nSeconds later, the *Sanctuary* emitted a dull thud that must have been its end of the Jump Array accepting an arrival. It was only the first of the ten that would deliver the first colonists and their equipment and effects to Cimbrean.\n___\n\nTen minutes later, Powell was riding shotgun in one of the Mules as it bounced and skidded across fertile flood plains. The stream that ran through the palace grounds at Folctha met up with a larger river, which in turn flowed out to the inland sea, from which a column of white smoke provided a clear marker as to the final resting place of the downed cruiser. \n\nThe mules were half pickup truck, half quad bike, and quite capable of getting themselves out of damn near anything the terrain might snare them with or, in the worst case, being physically hauled out by some strong men. Their supply of the diesel the little vehicles ran on was limited, but the development plan included finding a local plant species to refine into a biofuel. Besides, if anybody *had* survived the splashdown, the platoon needed to have men on the shore waiting to collect sooner rather than later, and the only way to get down there fast enough was by vehicle.\n\nThey pulled themselves to a loam-spraying halt as the sky flashed brilliantly from the direction of the sea. Every man in the mules and the truck flung themselves overboard and hit the dirt, half expecting a lethal shockwave to rampage up the valley and toss the vehicles flying, the product of some kind of nuclear meltdown or similar cataclysm. What instead arrived, after too many tense heartbeats, was a great echoing thunder of detonation that went on too long and was too gentle at that range to have been anything so apocalyptic.\n\n“The fuck just happened?” One of the SEALs asked, being the first to break the silence.\n\n“Maybe it blew up?” Opined a Canadian SOR trooper.\n\n“That’d put paid to any survivors then.” Powell said. “Better hope not, we’ve still got a human to bag and tag. Mount up, let’s get down there.”\n\nWaves were still lapping the sands and pebbles when they halted on the beach, and not a moment too soon: a trio of what looked like cargo transports of some kind were hovering across the water, propelled by *rowing* of all things.\n\nA dishevelled hulk of a man, all muscles, wild hair, wilder eyes and unkempt beard splashed into the surf and waded ashore. He raised his hands in response to the guns that immediately aimed at him, but smiled.\n\n“G’day”. he said.\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418264964", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 82, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "___\n\n**Brick, New Jersey, Earth.**\n\n*Our first destination - after we had finally calmed Mikhael down and he had agreed not to reduce our abductors to a fine paste - was a class eleven world.* \n\n*I wish I knew its location, or anything more about it than its classification, but it was a pleasant place. Clement warm weather, stunning scenery, gravity just a little lighter than Earth’s, atmospheric pressure just a little higher. I felt quite buoyant - Mikhael complained of the heat. Supposedly, the world was home to a host of terrifying plagues, but neither of us ever got so much as a sniffle. Incompatible with human biology, I suppose. Or maybe Earth’s plagues are just nastier still. Who knows?*\n\n*Have you ever heard a Geiger counter in action? Many people are alarmed by how rapidly and often they click just in response to background radiation. That in itself really ought to be a clue as to how cruel a mother the Earth is, when you think about it. That the basic background level of radiation to which we are entirely accustomed seems excessive even to us when we first learn of it…?*\n\n*...Well, this planet - I suspected that it would only be the first of many we visited, and so I named it “*Prathama*”  - had a background radiation much lower than that of Earth. It was so low, in fact, that Mikhael and I both fretted that the counter was broken, and requested replacements. The replacements corroborated the original, and in hindsight, why WOULD an alien world have the same background radioactivity as Earth? It would hardly be an alien world if it was identical, would it?*\n\n*We had been dropped on this world, and told to search the area. Given who we were and the equipment our “employer” had granted us, it wasn’t hard to put together that we were searching for fallout zones, but what wasn’t clear was why. Deathworlds, after all, are supposed to be uninhabited. Humanity, we are told, is a lone statistical anomaly, the one race to defy the odds.*\n\n*If that were true, and if spacefaring sophonts avoid deathworlds out of sensible caution, then why would there be any kind of evidence of nuclear catarstrophe on the surface of such a world?*\n\n___\n\n**Folctha, Cimbrean**\n\nA cry of “They’re coming back!” echoed across the camp.\n\nSir Jeremy turned to his predecessor as Cimbrean’s colonial governor and extended a hand. “Best of luck, Jen.” he said.\n\n“And you, Sir Jeremy.” she replied, shaking it. “Enjoy the paperwork.”\n\n“You can call me Jeremy.” He allowed. “I’ll make sure to have the bath enclosed and hooked up to the hot water. You’ll always be welcome here.”\n\nShe smiled. “Thanks…” a quick check showed that the truck was picking its way down the hillside. They had only a few minutes until the survivors from the ship reached the camp, and neither Jen nor Kirk had any intention of being identified as having been present. “I’d better run.”\n\n“Before you go…” Sir Jeremy rummaged in his pocket and produced a folded envelope. “This is from the Prime Minister. He would like you to do something more for Earth. I suspect you’ll find it more to your liking than ‘*governoring*’.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“You’ll have your own spaceship for a start. Read it as you go.”\n\n“I’ll do that. See you when I see you, Jeremy.” They shook hands, and she ran, sure-footed across the palace rubble and across the open field up the *Sanctuary*’s ramp, which closed behind her.\n\n“*Just in time.*” Kirk said. “*I was about to leave you.*”\n\n*Sanctuary*’s engines heaved, and she popped up and was gone in a startlingly short space of time, inertial compensation making the whole exercise feel eerily detached from the way the ground retreated and curled at the edges in short order. Jen’s last glimpse of Folctha was when the camo field snapped on below them, obscuring the vehicles just before they entered the camp.\n\nThey paused when Cimbrean itself was nothing more than a distant crescent sliver of blue-white, so small that she could have covered it with a pinhead at arm’s length, and *Sanctuary* pulsed once as Kirk fired something into orbit around the star.\n\n“What was that?” She asked.\n\n“*System defence field.*” Kirk said. “*A little modified. The colonists brought it back from Scotch Creek with them.*”\n\n“Oh… a whole system? Like the one round Earth?”\n\n“Very similar.” Kirk agreed. “Except that we can turn this one off when we want to.”\n\nJen said nothing, and pulled the letter from her pocket.\n\nShe was halfway through re-reading it when Kirk interrupted her thoughts. “*Ready to go FTL.” he informed her. “*Where would you like to go?*”\n\n“Irbzrk.” \n___\n\n“How’re they doing?”\n\nThe colony’s newly-arrived doctor was an American, Dr. Martin Adams, and had undergone intensive training in nonhuman anatomy and medicine as a precaution. He had, to put it mildly, been surprised as all hell to have to practice his skills the instant he arrived. He and Powell had met briefly during the preliminary phases of the colony operation, and he had the intense, competent air of somebody who threw themselves completely into their work.\n\n“One of the vizkittiks died.” he reported. “Not much we could do for her. The rest, well… I’ve set their bones, cleaned and dressed their wounds and made them comfortable, but they just don’t heal as fast as we do. Some of them are going to be in here for a long while. Frankly it’s a good thing we all have those disease-suppression implants or they’d be in serious trouble already.”\n\n“And the Spetsnaz?” Powell asked him.\n\n“Kaminsky’s basically fine. I’ve got his arm plastered, and a big glass of water sorted out the last of that “pixie dust” stuff. There’s nothing I can do for the other guy though. I got an IV in him, but if or when he pulls through is out of my hands, captain. Frankly, he needs to go back to Earth.”\n\n“His only ride just left, too… Alright. Keep me posted. For now I want a word with our POW.”\n\n“He’s over there.” Dr. Adams jerked a thumb to a bed with the curtains drawn. “Knock yourself out.” \n\nKaminsky was sitting up in his cot, looking bored. The man standing guard over the prisoner was a valuable resource kept from doing something more constructive, Powell knew. Hopefully, Kaminsky would turn out to be cooperative and his warder could be returned to a *useful* assignment.\n\nRussian was a language that still formed an important part of the modern British special-forces soldier’s curriculum, but he knew only a few key phrases. Still, it seemed only polite to use them. “*Kак дела*, captain?” he asked. \n\nKaminsky’s English wasn’t perfect and was heavily accented, but was a damn-sight better than Powell’s Russian. The translator implants he had received from the alliance were useless: Powell didn’t have a matching set for them to talk with. Still, he might come in handy as an interpreter for the alien prisoners.\n\n“Better.” The Spetsnaz captain replied. “I could do with vodka though. Several vodkas.”\n\n“You lost men on that ship?” Powell asked him,\n\n“*Da*. Sorry: yes I did. To traps, ambushes, maybe to that fucking foam.” Kaminsky indicated the dormant form of Markovitz, then to an empty cot opposite his own. “Sit down.” he invited.\n\nPowell did so. “So, I want to strike a deal, mate.” he said.\n\nKaminsky looked interested. “What deal?”\n\n“If I HAVE to, I’ll need to asnsign a guard to you at all times, and I’ve got fookin’ precious few men to waste on that duty. You can see how a Russian special forces trooper smack in the middle of my mission is a bit of a sticky wicket.”\n\n“I see that.”\n\n“So… do I have to?”\n\n“What is your offer?” Kaminsky asked, carefully. \n\n“Quid pro quo, mate. A little information, and I might be persuaded you’re going to behave yourself and I can put private Hodder there back to work.”\n\n“Where I’m from, my interrogation would not be so pleasant.” Kaminsky joked.\n\n“Been there, fookin’ done that.” Powell told him. “But I don’t see the need to start wi’ threats and pain when you and I can just come to an officer’s agreement, like.”\n\n“I agree. It is better this way.” Kaminsky said. “But are you asking about the spaceship and how I came to be on it? Or about my Australian friend with the alien mutant juice?”\n\n“Alien mutant juice.” Powell’s tone of voice was a flat repetition, but also a question.\n\n“Just something he said, and my suspicions. I’ll tell first one story, then the other, yes?”\n\nPowell acquiesced with a bobble of his head and a shrug. “Sounds fair.”\n\nHe listened. Kaminsky’s life had rapidly swung for the strange the second he had encountered the now-crashed cruiser, moving from a relative cakewalk to a desperate fight to survive. All things considered, that the man had escaped only with some mild poisoning and a broken ulna to show for it was impressive.\n\nWhether out of soldierly efficiency, Russian brevity or simple terseness from being a slightly hesitant Anglophone, Roman’s account didn’t take long. They sat considering the implications for a while.\n\nFinally, Powell stood up and shook the Spetsnaz officer’s hand. “I have your word you’ll behave?” he said.\n\n“I would like to go home as soon as possible.” Kaminsky confessed. “I think betraying your trust would only delay that.”\n\n“Good enough for me.” Powell said, then deployed some of his own meager Russian again. “*Спасибо за информацию.*”\n\nKaminsky smiled. “*Пожалуйста.*” he said. “Good luck with this Australian, he’s crazy.”\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418265042", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 79, "controversiality": 0}

It looked like working muscle, too, rather than pure steroidal bulk. \n\nHe let the man stew for a few minutes as he sorted out some paperwork, including a quick re-read of Saunders’ file. When he judged that his prisoner was about on the verge of starting to fidget, he looked up and gave him his well-practiced “I really don’t have time to deal with this shit so you’d damn well better impress me” look. \n\nContrary to the usual response, Saunders instead smirked and laughed slightly.\n\n\"I’m not findin' this fookin’ funny!\" Powell snapped, shutting the man up even if the response was more arrogantly sullen than alarmed. \"Do you have any idea what kind of problems you've caused just by being here? If you *are* who I think you are, you're doin’ a shite job being dead!\"\n\n\"And if I *am* who you think I am, you should have a long fucking think before making it known.” Saunders retorted, though why he felt that should be the case was a mystery from Powell’s perspective. “Where's Jennifer Delaney?\"\n\n\"You don’t ask questions,\" Powell told him. \"You answer them.\"\n\nThis earned another insubordinate frown. Frankly, it was amazing the man had made any kind of a career in the military at all. His body language and defiant expression was more rebellious teenager than professional soldier. \"You bastards just shot down my ship-\" He began to protest.\n\nPowell interrupted him, not in the mood to let the prisoner claim the initiative. \"Captain Kaminski tells me it was a pirate vessel, and that you only boarded it once he'd taken control of it,\" He said. \"In fact, he's told me a lot of interesting things about you.\"\n\nSaunders gave a dismissive shrug. \"So I'm the one who stole it most recently. I'm still the guy who crash landed a starship on a planet and walked away, and that's not even close to the most fucking terrifying thing I've done this week.”\n\nPowell had once led a team which infiltrated a Jihadist compound specifically to stab one man and steal his notebook, then exfiltrated with the entire camp hunting for them. That had taken skill, courage and no small amount of daring. Surviving a water landing in a starship, especially a badly damaged one, smacked more of luck, and luck in his experience was not to be relied upon, nor boasted about. “Not fookin’ impressed, mate.” he said.\n\nThis dismissal seemed to score a hit because Saunders shifted forward angrily and raised his voice, apparently oblivious to the five guns that all snapped to aim directly at him, and the way Powell’s hand dropped his holstered sidearm. “I've just been on a merry jaunt through fucking *hell*” he snarled “and all I want is the answer to **One. Goddamned. Question!**\" \n\nPowell let the moment of tension play out, until Saunders calmed down a bit and sat back. The angry shouting approach hadn’t worked, forcing him into a more reciprocal, reasonable approach. \"Please?\" he asked eventually, settling down.\n\nPowell kept his satisfaction from showing, and instead made a show of standing down in turn, as did his men. \"Quid pro quo, then.” he said. “You answer my questions and I'll answer what I can of yours. Something tells me neither of us is going to like the answers.\"\n\n\"No fucking kidding?\" Adrian asked. \"Well, I haven't liked much for as long as I can remember, so why the fuck should I start now? Where's Jennifer Delaney?\"\n\n\"**First**” Powell persisted, “Your name.\" He gave it a moment, then when no answer seemed forthcoming, he decided to say it outright. \"You are Adrian-\"\n\nThe captive interrupted, jerking a thumb towards the soldiers. \"You better trust these fuckers here implicitly if you're going to finish that sentence. Or maybe we can just assume that whatever you were going to say is right?\"\n\nPowell gave him a cool stare. Of *course* he trusted them implicitly. This was a top secret mission, and the men under his command were the best of the best. Not a single one of them was a security liability. \n\nBesides, whatever reasons the man felt he had for needing to keep his secret superhero identity - and Powell wasn’t about to rule out some kind of paranoid delusion - he hadn’t yet revealed what they might be. Powell wasn’t interested in playing “Interstellar Man of Mystery.”\n\n\"....*Saunders*.” he finished. “As for Miss Delaney, you just missed her. She shipped out when we detected your mob comin’ in. \"\n\nThere was a long, bewildered pause, and then the Australian broke down and started laughing. It wasn’t a happy laugh - it was a black cynical one, the laugh of a man who’d just figured out that he was the butt of a sadistic sense of humour.  \"Of course... of course she did!” He exclaimed, somewhere between the laughing and the sobs. “Gone home I bet? No reason to wait for a dead man!\"\n\n\"*Jesus fookin’ Christ…*\" \n\nPowell decided, as the Australian slowly pulled himself together, *not* to correct him on that point. Jen had clearly been holding a torch for this guy, but mental cases like this tended to be a danger to themselves and anybody nearby. Jen was too competent, capable and useful a resource to endanger like that.\n\n\"Kaminski wasn't bloody kidding,\" he declared. \"Is the rest true? The infrared? The... muscles?\"\n\nAdrian nodded as he ran a rough hand through his beard and across his head. \"Yep,\" he said, voice still trembling, \"but I wouldn't fucking recommend it. How are the Russians doing? Quid pro quo, remember?\"\n\nTrue enough. \"Kaminski’s recovered. We have no idea what's wrong with Markovic outside of 'Pixie Dust'. Something to do with the alien fire suppressant?\"\n\n\"Apparently it sends you totally fucking mental before you go catatonic. At least that's what I've gathered from it.” Saunders revealed. “I'd stay away from that shit if I were you.\"\n\n&lt;*+No shit.+*&gt; Powell thought, feeling that his intelligence was being insulted. Who did this idiot think he was dealing with? There wasn’t a soldier on Cimbrean who wasn’t veteran special forces, they didn’t need advice from a crazed resurrectee, they needed the facts, unbiased and plain. Shit like “Don’t breath in the toxic foam” went without saying.\n\nHe kept his cool by changing the subject. \"You're a wanted man on Earth, you know,\" He told him, keeping his tone light and companionable. \"By rights, we're supposed to imprison you and keep you until we can send you back… but.\"\n\nHe looked the Australian up and down. \"I can *smell* the kind of shit you're in, and I'm not going to put this colony and my mission at risk over a dropout who’s legally fookin’ dead.” He said. “D’you know how long *that* paperwork takes? I don’t have the fookin' time nor the inclination, so long as you promise to get the fook out of my hair and never come back. Spread the word there’s nowt but ruins on Cimbrean and I might even be persuaded to see if there’s owt useful you can be doin’ instead of stealin’ pirate ships and chasing after a girl who’s got her shit together way better than you do.\"\n\nThey stared at each other for a few moments, then Adrian unclenched his fists, sighed and nodded. \"Looks like you've still got some broken down old ships. I can probably put a working one together given a bit of time, a week... two at most, and then I'll be out of your hair.\" he offered.\n\n\"Good,\" said Powell. Anything to get the man away from the colony and back out in the wider galaxy where he could do less harm.  \"We'll give you food, clothes and shelter... and a fookin' shave if you want it, but you need to get out of here before you become a problem. And for the moment, *Captain*,” he added, stressing Saunders’ former rank “you are going to give me a full debriefing.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418265139", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 77, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "He listened as the disgrace seated opposite him relented and launched into a characteristically foul-mouthed summary of everything that had happened to him since his abduction.\n\nWhat was clear was that Saunders was completely out of his gourd, and a danger both to himself and to everybody around him. He briefly entertained the thought of just shooting the dangerous prat then and there and giving him a grave somewhere in the Folctha palace grounds. It would certainly have been the most expedient solution, and when it came down to it the SBS had done a lot worse during their history for the sake of the mission than putting down a figurative rabid dog.\n\nIt wasn’t a choice between pragmatism and compassion so much as a choice between conflicting forms of pragmatism, really. In the end, letting him live won out. Getting the word spread that Cimbrean was uninhabited might just put paid to the rumours of a colonial effort that had lured Saunders here in the first place. Not to mention that having the man sighted a long way from here could only increase the colony’s security, next to the trail going cold on its way here. Besides, if he kept taking crazy risks then eventually his luck or tenacity would run out and that would be the end of it.\n\n“The fookin’ *dinosaurs* built a spaceship.” He said, flatly. It wasn’t a question so much as a simple statement of disbelief.\n\n“Yep.” Saunders said it with his apparently trademark “*I couldn’t give a fuck even if somebody else did all the heavy lifting*” attitude, but also with the total assurance of somebody who knew what they were saying was absurd and yet sincerely believed it to be the truth.\n\n“I asked for a fookin’ debriefing, not a flight of fancy.”\n\n“Space dragons, fucking X-files grey aliens, blue giraffes, raccoon people, and, yep, the dinosaurs built a fucking spaceship. Not my fault the universe is totally fucking mental.” Saunders objected.\n\nHe sniffed, and added: “Fucking good spaceship, too.”\n\nPowell sat back and considered as Saunders rambled on at length about saurian robotic terminators, stasis chambers, the trouble with blue fur, statues, collapsing buildings, missile-riding, Vulza-riding and how much he hated fire suppressant, black holes and Darragh Houston. The whole monologue was being recorded for transmission back to Earth. How much of it was true or even plausible wasn’t a matter he intended to waste much time and thought on, but he did notice that while Saunders mentioned something called the “Hierarchy” a couple of times, he didn’t elaborate on who - or what - said Hierarchy might be. \n\nWhen it came up again, he finally had to interrupt. \"Okay, that's the third fookin' time you've mentioned this 'Hierarchy'. Who in the hell are **they** meant to be?\" he demanded.\n\nSaunders had the good grace to look embarrassed. \"Long and short of it? They're the Space Illuminati.\"\n\n“For *fook*’s sake!” Powell exploded to his feet, spun away from the desk and pinched the bridge of his nose as he stood facing the corner for a second, head bowed. “I have no idea why I don’t just assume you’re taking the piss.” he muttered. \n\n\"I know a few things... they're beyond cutting-edge. They've got a fucking army. And they love robots. Oh, and they can copy their brains away.\" \n\n“Greeeaaat.” Powell muttered. He turned and considered things. “Bloody ‘ell, Why in God’s name do I believe you, Saunders?”\n\n\"Don't fucking ask me.” the Australian gave him a wild-eyed shrug. “**I** hardly believe all this shit. But you do have a crashed Hierarchy ship sitting offshore.\"\n\n\"Not like I can do owt with it.\" Powell grumbled as he sat down again. Nobody on his team was even remotely qualified to handle, salvage or work with nonhuman technology. A critical mission oversight, in retrospect. \n\n&lt;+*And here I thought this debriefing was going to make my job LESS fookin' difficult.*+&gt; he mused.\n\nAdrian shrugged. “*You* can’t.” he said.\n\nPowell, distracted by his own thoughts didn’t catch the inflection properly. “Can’t… what now?” he asked\n\n“*You* can’t do anything with it. *I* probably can.” Adrian repeated.\n\n“...My lads and the SEALs could dive that wreck, no problem, but we wouldn’t know the warp engine from the shitter.” Powell said. “You sayin’ you would?”\n\n“I rebuilt a dinosaur spaceship and killed a fleet of fucking arseholes with it.” Saunders boasted, looking as if he was regaining a degree of focus. There was a hint of the once-professional soldier in the way he spoke. “I'm not saying it's recoverable but if it is...\"\n\nPowell considered, scratching his own facial hair. \"...If it is, you might actually turn out to not be a complete fookin' liability after all.\" he acknowledged. \n\nSaunders’ professionalism slipped again, and there was a certain manic glint in his eye that only reinforced Powell’s conviction that he belonged as far away from Cimbrean as possible if the colony was to succeed. “\"I was going to take some hard fucking revenge on these fuckers anyway, so... you know, it's no problem.\" he said.\n\nPowell weighed his options. Unstable though he was, Saunders was the only man to hand who had the knowledge and experience necessary to do anything with the crashed “Hierarchy” ship before the salt water completely ruined it. And if they were as dangerous as he suggested, then his mission demanded at least sweeping the thing for tracking devices, beacons or other potential mission-compromisers, not to mention intelligence of a long-term threat.\n\n“...Fine.” he relented. “You get to dive that wreck. You find any intel we can use and turn it over,and I might even drop the whole \"never come back\" thing. Now, I'm still kickin' you off this planet because I need trouble like you a **long** way from my mission, but if you can prove you're not a complete cock-up and turn up owt that's useful - and rip out and destroy anything that might lead this Hierarchy here... Well, there's the deal.\"\n\n\"Honestly I doubt it even has what I want.” Adrian confessed. “But I'll be sure to look. What about after I’ve left? You got a phone number?\"\n\n“Next best thing.” Powell said. “You know Star Trek?”\n\n“Yeah. My old man had an obsession.” \n\n“Good, then you should remember this. There’s an… agent we use. He handles courier work, messages and odd jobs for us. He’s got an interstellar datanet dropbox, if you have a message for us, send it there and he’ll pass it on. The address is November-Charlie-Charlie one-seven-zero-one. Got that?”\n\n“Got it.” Saunders nodded, the soldier showing again for a second, in the attentive way he gave his undivided attention to the important information.\n\n“You know how to stay secure online?”\n\n“I have a guy who can crack cyber security like an egg.” Adrian reassured him.\n\n“You trust him?”\n\n\"We've seen a lot of shit together, so you know how it is. I know he's not Hierarchy.\"\n\nThat would have been good enough for Powell had the Australian been talking about a fellow human, but only one name in the story he had just told fit the description.\n\n“You don't mean this \"Askit\" bloke, do you? I thought you said he was Corti?\"\n\nTrusting a Corti with valuable information was, as far as the analysts back on Earth had been concerned, about the same thing as trying to carry boiling oil in a colander. The only way it could end was you’d get burned. You only told them secrets if you WANTED those secrets to fall into enemy hands.\n\n\"He is,” Adrian acknowledge “And I've almost never wanted to kill him.\"\n\n\"...Whatever.” Powell sighed. “I guess trustin' *you* with this means trusting whoever you trust in turn. Just don't send in the clear, and use a codename. \"Kirk\", \"Enterprise\" and \"Federation\" are already taken. Got that?\"\n\nAdrian considered, and then an impish grin parted his beard. \"Reckon I might go with Captain Scarlet. Looks like I'm breaking the theme.\"\n\n\"If playing the fookin' special snowflake is what floats your cock, sure. Whatever.\" Powell told him. \"Got anything more to add before I let you bugger off and start building your pet starship?\"\n\n\"Just one thing.” Adrian replied, shifting forward in his seat. “I'm about to start waging my own personal fucking war on an enemy I can't even imagine. If you've got a wish list for souvenirs just let me know.\"\n\nHe wasn’t engaging his brain or else that list should have been obvious, but then again Powell knew the value of repeating things in case something had been overlooked. \"Anything that *proves* they exist and aren't just your imagination.” He said, extending his fingers to list the items he could think of. “Bleeding-edge technology. Alien hard drives, journals, logbooks, computers, that kind of thing. A working cloaking device, or at least one that's not too badly broken. Maps, encryption keys... intel, basically.\"\n\n\"You need a cloaking device?” Saunders asked, sounding faintly incredulous. He waved his arm vaguely towards the tent wall, indicating the unseen crashed starships outside. “You've got a half dozen wrecked Hunter ships lying all over the place.\"\n\n“Bloody lovely.” Powell agreed. “Now if you can point out which *bit* of the fookin' things is the cloaking device, I might consider it a tick in the \"not a complete waste of space\" column.\"\n\nSaunders scowled “Your confidence is fucking overwhelming.” he grumbled. “I'll put it on the list of shit I have to do.\"\n\n\"Saunders:” Powell warned “As far as I’m concerned. the *one* thing that makes you worth the oxygen you're breathing is that you're the only bastard on this planet right now who knows a spaceship's arse from its elbow.” \n\nHe looked Adrian dead in the slightly crazed eye. “Remember that, aye?”\n\nThe intimidation tactics didn’t seem to work: Saunders seemed to take it more as a joke than as a reminder of just how tenuous his position was, and grinned. “I’ll remember.” he promised.\n\n“Right.”\n\nPowell nodded upwards towards the door, dismissing the man. “Fook off.”\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418265168", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 80, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "___\n\n**Brick, New Jersey, Earth.**\n\n*Not that it was easy to tell: The concrete - it was made of hexagonal slabs of poured concrete, rather than asphalt -  had been breached by trees, and the forest that violated the hard-top was just as dense along the road’s length as in the good soil to either side of it. It must have been… oh, a hundred years or more since it had been last maintained. Had we not stopped to examine the dying creature, we might  have just stepped over the concrete road surface, dismissing it as a rock formation.*\n\n*But once you saw the hard straight lines of the carriageway’s edge, and saw the material for what it was, other details made themselves known. The way that little clump of tangled thorny vegetation over THERE had a suspicious hint of rusty metal chassis, and the way that the creepers and vines over THERE seemed to have grown down from some kind of scaffold. That sort of thing. Everything was so green and alive that it all but completely obscured those fingerprints of an industrial civilisation.*\n\n*There are only so many ways to build a car, I suppose. And only so many ways to reliably make it move. Only so many ways to build an internal combustion engine. All fancy and artistry aside, engineering is the art of effecting an efficient solution to a problem, and air resistance is much the same everywhere in the galaxy, as too are the demands of being able to readily carry a reliable and efficient fuel source.*\n\n*The point is… there they were. Cars. Road signs. clear and visible signs that, once upon a time, Prathama had been home to a civilisation every bit as vibrant and technologically proficient as our own was in the latter half of the 20th century.*\n\n*A civilisation that was, it seemed, utterly dead.*\n\n___\n\n**Cimbrean**\n**Date Point: 3Y 8M 1W 3D AV**\n\nLance Corporal Danny Michael watched the Australian shave with the kind of pleasure only possible for a man who’d gone without for a good long while, and the transition between wild-haired spaceman and barely-tanned skinhead was a quick once he got to it. The man, Captain Adrian Saunders of the ADF, was judged by Captain Powell to be of a particularly unstable variety, and so Michael and Marine Paul Richard - his good mate and current off-sider - had been assigned to watch over him in case he tried anything too manic.\n\nSuch as fuckin’ well killing everyone.\n\n\"You've got no fucking idea how good this feels,\" Saunders told them, assuming a great many things in the process. Michael had once been taken captive by Islamists who hadn’t recognised him for a soldier, and had paid the price months later when he’d been able to get himself and the other surviving prisoners free and clear of their shitty little compound. It was amazing how thick hair could grow on a man in the hot desert sun, and shaving it off had felt like coming home.\n\nMichael just shared a knowing glance with Richard; they knew each others’ stories and there wasn’t any need for words in front of a crazy bastard like Saunders. That fucker could think whatever he wanted for all Michael cared.\n\nSaunders turned out to be a little more balanced than Powell had feared; there hadn’t been any outbursts of violence that would have required them to put him down like a mad dog, even if doing so would have allowed them to move into other, far more interesting duties. Most of what Saunders seemed to do was to focus on tearing all the alien shit out of smashed up alien ships, and moving it over to the one that was the least fucked up. He’d started work on repairs once he’d amassed a small mountain of technological garbage, and had spent the next few days turning large holes in the ship’s hull into equally large patches.\n\nEven once he’d completed the work to his own satisfaction, the ship didn’t look anything like spaceworthy. If anything it looked exactly like it’d crashed a second time, and was waiting for someone to come and put it out of its fucking misery. Saunders seemed happy with it, however, and commenced his work on the inside with an enthusiasm Michael recognised as a man doing what he was made for. That was another thing Captain Powell had said to watch for: Saunders knew his way around alien technology, and that gave him the kind of dangerous edge that needed an eye kept on it; you could do a lot with a sharp knife, but if you didn’t watch it you’d cut your fucking finger off and then where would you be?\n\nNine days into their watch - Michael was thankful that they’d only pulled day duty on the bastard - Adrian Saunders was eating a breakfast of branflakes and fruit, sitting amongst a morass of cabling, panels, and all sorts of technological doodads that Michael could have told you sweet fuck all about. Powell walked in, took one look at the huge fuckin’ mess, and shot an angry look at Saunders. \"Day *nine*, and this thing is a complete fookin' mess!\"\n\nUnlike most men, military or otherwise, Saunders was entirely unintimidated by Captain Powell. If anything, he seemed to regard the concept of other people intimidating him as something of a joke, which Michael took as much of an affront that Powell himself did. \"It's a whole shitload better than it was when I started,\" he said, although it didn't look it from the unused junk that was laying everywhere. \"And you'll remember I said a week or *two*. I haven't broken any promises yet.\"\n\nInsubordinate as usual, but Powell had taken to ignoring it. Had it been Michael in his place, he doubted he would have been quite so forgiving. \"I'm told you're still relyin' on *our* generator to power this piece of shite,\" Powell noted, still looking all kinds of pissed off. \"Will this fookin' thing even get into space?\"\n\n“Not without its own generators,” Saunders admitted, taking a big bite out of his fruit and chomping away happily on its crisp flesh. Michael wondered if he did that on purpose in some attempt to further infuriate everybody around him. \"Don't worry, I've got something in mind.\"\n\nThe assurance didn’t make Powell any happier, and if anything his glare grew even darker. \"You fookin' well better, mate, because I've got people asking who the arsehole working on the ship is. It's not lost on everybody that you've turned up alongside a bunch of prisoners, and you're the only one walking around happy as can be. They're wondering why that is!\"\n\nA fair question to Michael’s mind, he’d heard the talk amongst people in his time off and he and Richard both had gotten asked questions about it. Telling the colonists it was secret under ‘operational security’ had worn out its usefulness over the last couple of days, and now there were all sorts of fuckin’ rumours going around.\n\nSaunders took his time and finished the piece of fruit with obvious relish before continuing, although it didn’t seem like he was being so much wilfully annoying as just crazy as fuck. “Well,” he said thoughtfully, \"I'm planning on testing the kinetics tomorrow, and if all goes to plan I'm headed out to sea the day after. These boys of yours like water?\"\n\nMichael experienced the sort of sinking feeling most often attributed to submarinal activities and just being goddamned unlucky, and he could see that this little expedition was most likely going to involve both.\n\n“They go where you go, so long as it’s on this planet,” Powell replied, effectively repeating what he’d said when he’d first assigned Michael and Richard to their duty. “That includes out to sea.”\n\n“They’ll need some wet gear,” Adrian unnecessarily informed them with far more fuckin’ amusement than Michael cared to see. \"You might be able to get by just using some vacuum suits. The Russians had some they might use.\"\n\n\"I'll see it's done,\" Powell replied curtly. \"That all?\"\n\nSaunders hesitated in his response, and turned to check on one of the boxes of components he’d been separating from the others and had actually been taking notes on. He slid it across the floor with an extended leg, pushing it over towards Powell. \"I got you a present,\" he said. \"Now you can be like Kevin Bacon.\"\n\nPowell looked into the box, apparently enjoying the same lack of comprehension about the fuckin’ psycho’s babbling that Michael and Richard experienced on a constant basis. \"What the *fook* has Kevin Bacon got to do with fookin' anything?\"\n\nSaunders had the temerity to sigh, as though he’d expected something more of them. “Hollow man. That’s the cloaking system I promised you.”\n\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418265209", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 74, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "___\n\n**Folctha colony, Cimbrean, The Far Reaches.**\n\n“Alright, girl…” Saunders said to the ship, patting the console in front of him, “now we’re going to see some real cool shit.”\n\nMichael wasn’t sure about that, or about much of anything else right now. Neither he nor Richard felt comfortable flying around on this haphazard mess generously labelled a starship, and even less so given the fuckin’ nutter who was in charge. The huge fuckin’ spaceship ahead of them had been more like the real thing, even if it was half-trashed and mostly sunken beneath the waves, but they hid the impressed expressions well.\n\nSaunders had taken his ship around it, surveying the damage and looking for a half-decent entry point. There was hardly much of a consistent hull remaining, with huge holes decorating the whole thing, and entire sections were missing, but they soon found the top of a gap that Saunders deemed as sufficient for purpose.\n\nGravity shifted in a similar way to the feeling of an elevator in descent, and pushed them downwards into the cerulean depths. From here the fantastic wreckage took on a moodier, haunted appearance, and in spite of his certainty that there was nothing to be found aboard more dangerous than himself, Michael swallowed. “But this is a *spaceship*,” he found himself saying, “not a fuckin’ submarine…”\n\nSaunders shot them a knowing smile. “Spot probably can’t go as deep as a sub, but she *can* probably get us where we need to go.”\n\nMichael ignored the fact that the madman was naming his spaceship and focused on the important issue. “Probably?” he asked, not liking that sort of uncertainty. He might have been prepared for danger, and even death, when coming to an alien world, but he’d really prefer it if his death didn’t involve drowning in a patched together starship that was slowly sinking into an alien ocean.\n\nRichard was less willing to overlook the eccentricity. \"'ang on a moment, did you just call this fookin' thing '*Spot*'?\" he demanded.\n\nSaunders shrugged, looking back towards his console to hopefully focus on whatever crazy shit he was about to do next. Not that Michael *wanted* the fuckin’ maniac to do crazy shit, it just seemed like sort of a given at this point, and he’d rather the requisite amount of attention be paid to make it a success. “Just looks sort of like a fucking huge dog head…” he explained, although Michael didn’t see *how*, “in a certain light.”\n\nAt least Richard didn’t press the point on that, waiting quietly next to Michael with only a small amount of nervous fidgeting. Saunders was focused for several more moments before he turned to glance over at them. “Opening the airlock outer door,” he warned them, illustrating that he wasn’t a complete fuckin’ idiot.\n\nThere was a brief sound of machinery working near the airlock, but nothing that followed it. That, it seemed, was enough to please Saunders. “Kinetic bubble holding.”\n\nMichael shared a glance with Richard, waiting for everything to turn to shit. When it didn’t, Saunders turned to face them properly, lifting up his own helmet in preparation, and grinning at them like the psychotic madman he was. \"I'd put my fucking helmet on now if I were you. I'm about to open the airlock inner door, and I'm not what you might call entirely confident we won't all drown.\"\n\nThey only hesitated for a moment before taking the advice. Now they were underwater, and in his hands, and they had to hope like hell that he knew what he was doing. Not fuckin’ reassuring. As it turned out they were worried for nothing, because the inner door opened to reveal a shimmering wall of water at the edge of the ship.\n\nSaunders rose from his seat, stepped over to it and ran a hand through the water. “Gentlemen,” he said, holding up a dripping hand, “I give you the sea!”\n\nMichael and Richard shared another worried glance, it was never good when the man you needed to keep you alive started making jokes at inappropriate times. Richard was unimpressed enough to tell the fucker what he thought, gesturing to his alien spacesuit as he did so. \"You're fookin' mad if you reckon we're going out there in these!\"\n\nMichael agreed with him though. “This is a *space* suit, mate,” he said. “See a lot of fuckin' space out dere? How d'you think we're supposed to swim in dese?\"\n\nThat just got more crazy from Saunders. “Oh,” he said, waggling his eyebrows, “I wasn’t going to *swim*.”\n\nAt that he collected three stripped down alien hover devices, demonstrating his own for their benefit. He activated it, letting it pull him away, and dived into the ocean with mad laughter. Richard swore, repeatedly, and Michael was quick to join him. They grabbed their respective devices, repeating the demonstrated action, and let them drag them forward into the water beyond.\n\nMichael hit the man with all of his might when they caught him at the entrance of the crashed ship, and was happy to hear the wind leave the stupid arsehole in spite of the water resistance. \"Next time you do somethin' like that it's a knife,\" he warned angrily. \"What's so fuckin' useful down 'ere that you needed to come back?\"\n\nSaunders coughed, putting a hand to his side protectively. “Starship reactor,” he said, “it was still live after we landed…”\n\n“Then why are all the fookin’ lights out?” Richard demanded, raising a very good point, though Michael figured it may be possible that being immersed in an ocean hadn’t helped.\n\n\"I blew them up last time I was here,\" Saunders admitted with an unwarranted casual shrug.\n\nMichael stared at the man, and Richard shook his head in disgust. “You’re just about the worst fookin’ thing a man could put on a spaceship…”\n\nSaunders only shrugged again, apparently fully recovered from his injury, then turned and set off down a burned out corridor lit only by the small red power lights on their makeshift personal propulsion units. \n\nNot a problem, Michael thought, remembering that he’d been in places a lot more fucked up than this burned out alien wreck. Admittedly those had usually been better lit, and never underwater, but they had been full of arseholes with guns so he had that in his favour… probably.\n\nHe looked warily at the dark shapes looming in the debris filled environment, jutting out from beyond any place their meagre light could reach. He shook his head and made quick to follow the madman. At some point the day had to improve.\n\n___\n\n**Scotch Creek Extraterrestrial Research Facility, British Columbia, Canada, Earth**\n\n*The story was identical on Dvitiya, Trtiya, Caturtha, Pamcama and Sastha. We visited six worlds and found the same tragedy waiting for us every time. Six civilisations, all cut down in their prime. Most, their cities were flat fields, identifiable as having once been cities only by the eroded glass and corroded rebar that littered what was otherwise a verdant field.*\n\n*On one, Mikhael and I had to flee for our lives back onto the Corti research ship when the biohazard alarms screamed at us. The buildings were still, to some degree, standing. Hvek later commented that the virus we brought back with us was about on par with the Spanish Flu in terms of virulence and deadliness. Given that the world on which we encountered it was a class ten, I can only assume that it killed… everyone.*\n\n*Can you imagine, Mr. Jenkins, what those poor people must have felt? What the very last of their kind must have been thinking as he coughed his last bloody breath onto his pillow, having survived to watch everyone he loved and his whole world be torn apart by a disease that must have struck them like the wrath of an Asura?*\n\n*I have nightmares.*\n\n*Our tour lasted three years. We visited twelve more worlds. I ceased to name them after encountering that disease. But I did the mathematics.*\n\n*According to conventional wisdom, sapience cannot, and does not, arise on deathworlds.

{"body": "___\n\nThe starship reactor had been a relatively unimpressive thing. Michael had been expecting something like out of Star Trek, but what he got was a big white box, about the size of a small truck, covered in small red and blue indicator lights. As it was the only thing lit in the room he didn’t need Saunders to tell him what it was, but the madman’s burst of happy laughter confirmed it.\n\nRichard looked over at Michael and shook his head worriedly. “How are we supposed to move this fookin’ thing?” he demanded. “It’s the size of a fookin’ lorry!”\n\nSaunders kept working, and soon the majority of the indicator lights shut down. “We don’t need the containment unit,” he explained. “I've already got like five of the fucking things.\"\n\nMichael guessed that wasn’t the same thing as having a functional reactor, a suspicion proven a moment later as the madman drew a two foot white cylinder from the unit; it was covered in a constant outpouring of bubbles from its entire surface, and Saunders passed it over to him without explanation. “Hang onto that for me, mate. I’ve got another four to pull out.”\n\nRichard took the second in hand, inspecting it more closely. \"How come you need all these fookin' things when your ship is a bloody tiny thing compared to this?\"\n\nSaunders removed a third as he answered. “Because unlike the aliens,” he explained with unusual lucidity, “I believe in having some fucking redundancy. Four redundancies in this case.”\n\n“Wait, you only need one of these?” Richard asked, looking between the alien technology and Saunders. “Won’t this be putting too much power through everything?”\n\nThat was a good point, but Saunders didn’t seem concerned. “Yeah, but I already took care of that,” he assured them. “Five times the power, five times the glory.”\n\nThat was less than reassuring, but what was Michael going to do? Saunders was dangerous, but he was also their only way out of a crashed alien starship, and back to base. He pulled the last of them free, setting them aside before wandering over to a small, completely sealed unit that he opened with a utility knife. A moment later he was flashing a grin at them, and hefting his own reactors. “Now,” he said, “let’s go back. We’ve still got two stops to go.”\n\n“Where else are we fookin’ going?” Richard rightly objected. “We’re not supposed to be your fookin’ pack-mules, you know.”\n\nThe madman’s grin widened. “Art of war, mate,” he said. “It’s time for me to get to know my enemy.  We’re going over to the Hierarchy ship.”\n___\n\n*Hvek and Twanri were not bad people. They did not deserve to die. Neither did Mikhael. But in the Hierarchy, we are dealing with the kind of toes that are best left unstepped-on. And we had stepped heavily indeed.*\n\n*Neither of the Corti suspected just how much Mikhael and I could hear, you see. They deactivated their translators when they wished to converse in private, and for the first two years, that approach worked. By the third, well… Corti speech is perfectly comprehensible to the human ear, after all. Aep rhafe newn dte etchlimya ogtup oonb zurtuu. We learned how to listen to them.*\n\n*They spoke at length about this Hierarchy, enthused about how Twanri’s hypothesis was gaining evidence with every excursion. Alas, I never overheard them repeat exactly what that hypothesis was - they must both have been so intimately familiar with it that to speak it aloud would have been a waste of their time. But the essentials were clear. For some reason, within only twenty or thirty years at most after first splitting the atom, every species that has ever accomplished an industrial civilization as a native of a deathworld, has self-destructed, spectacularly.*\n\n*We ourselves came painfully close, as I’m sure you know, but Twanri seemed to take that as proof that, rather than being an inevitable product of deathworld mentalities, perhaps these extinctions were precipitated somehow. She sense the invisible hand of this Hierarchy, gently pushing so many wonderful peoples off the precipice and into the long dark.*\n\n*I dismissed the idea as excessive and outlandish, right up until the moment our ship came under attack.*\n___", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418265289", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 81, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "__\n\n**“Spot”. Cimbrean, The Far Reaches**\n\nSaunders had installed the reactor cylinders as soon as they’d returned to the ship, and even without a passing knowledge in how alien shit worked, Michael could see the difference they made; the movements of the ship were faster and more reactive, while Saunders seemed less inclined to take painstaking lengths to ensure every little movement was the right one. They’d taken a quick trip out across the continent at incredible speeds before arriving in a forest clearing where the only thing of note had been an alien landing pod.\n\nThis, Saunders had explained, was the means by which Jennifer Delaney had reached the planet, but it was stripped of whatever he had been hoping to find. He hadn’t left empty handed, however, and had come away with a piece of tech he’d called the navigational unit.\n\nAfter that they’d returned to the waters near the base, but this time they had remained above the water and Saunders had been content to conduct the dive by himself. The waters here were clearer than by the more recent crash, however, and the remains of a far more broken vessel were scattered on the sea floor below. \n\nMichael squinted to see through the water, trying to get a good view. It was smaller than the previous ship by a long way, and there was more of it missing than remained. \"What's this fuckin' thing then?\"\n\n\"Space Illuminati starship,\" Saunders answered candidly, and shortly noticed the looks this statement received. \"Not making it up.\"\n\nMichael scoffed, but he remembered the interminable briefings back on Earth. The point had stuck that the galaxy was a damned strange place and that humanity’s combined experience of it to date probably wasn’t yet even a scratch on the surface. Next to the space dragons, UFO-nut big-eyed aliens and genuine bug-eyed monsters \n\n\"No shite?\" Richard muttered, his attention returning to the shattered vessel. \"Looks like it's been blown to fookin' 'ell!\"\n\nSaunders flashed the mad grin at him. \"Not all of it, I hope, because otherwise this will be a waste of my fucking time.\"\n\nSaunders dove into the waters a moment later, leaving Michael and Richard to watch him from above, although if it hadn’t been for the small glow of light from the propulsion device they’d have lost sight of him amidst all the ruin.\n\n“Holy shit…” Saunders muttered several minutes into his trip, prompting Michael to demand a report, only to discover that the madman was easily startled by nothing more than a fuckin’ fish; at least he could be entertaining. \n\nWhen he did finally return, it was with a sack full of goodies, and he was eager to try them out. Richard and Michael, still frustratingly dependent on the Australian to get them home, sat patiently while Saunders fiddled with what he’d recovered, plugging in device after device until he finally came to one that caught his attention.\n\nThat one had spoken his name. Saunders had paused, aghast, muttered the word ‘tricks’, and had then commenced a conversation with an alien speaker that included some of what Powell had told them and a shitload more besides, even if they could only understand his half of it. Michael and Richard exchanged a glance. FTL communication was supposedly expensive as all hell and low-bandwidth even for the Corti, which was about the only thing that exonerated Saunders of any suspicion that he might be talking to some kind of handler or agent.\n\nFor all their boredom, both men were career spec-ops, and knew valuable intel when they heard it - they absorbed every word for later reporting to the Captain. They listened for hours before the Australian unplugged the device and returned to the cockpit, whereupon he set course, at long last, for Folctha. His shoulders had tensed and risen and his expression was murder itself.\n\n“We going home?” Michael checked, acutely aware that if Saunders chose now to set the ship to fly off to some godforsaken end of creation pursuing this ‘Hierarchy’, then both he and Richard were along for the ride and unable to fly the ship.\n\nSaunders turned to look at him with a new kind of cold, hard gaze. It was the kind that revealed a perfectly lucid man in full possession of his faculties - however temporarily that might be - and wanting to use them all to kill someone. Michael felt a chill as that hateful gaze landed on him; he had considered Saunders a threat before, though merely a disjointed one that could be dealt with; the lucid man before him was a different beast altogether, one wearing the face of the War himself. It was the first time he’d actually looked like a soldier, to Michael’s eyes, and therefore truly dangerous.\n\n“Yeah,” he confirmed coldly, “So take a fucking seat. I’ve got intel Powell is going to want to hear.”\n___\n\n**Scotch Creek Extraterrestrial Research Facility, British Columbia, Canada, Earth**\n\n*Did you ever encounter Allebenellin, Mister Jenkins? Vile things. Mercenary, callous, venal and stupid. The answer to how a race with such a startling lack of ambition ever accomplished intelligence, let alone how they used tools prior to the invention of their exoskeletons given that they lack limbs, eludes and mystifies me.*\n\n*In any case, we were crippled with the first volley. They boarded soon afterwards, and poor Hvek and Twanri were reduced to jelly by their pulse fire, sprayed across the command deck. These were the biggest ones, so-called “anti-tank” weaponry, and their fire caught Mikhael in the head. The blow killed him: massive fracturing and cerebral haemorrhage.* \n\n*Nevertheless, it gave the worms pause, because where the Corti had simply… splattered... here was a creature so tough that, though dead, he was still pretty much intact. They may even have thought he was still alive, which brought me the few seconds I needed to shout the commands, in Corti, which opened all of the doors and lowered the atmosphere retainment fields even as I shut the hatch of my escape pod.

{"body": "___\n\n**Folctha Colony, Cimbrean, The Far Reaches.**\n\nPowell heard the starship arrive long before Saunders made his usual commotion; the ship had come in fast and powerful, filling the air with a rolling thunder that echoed through the surrounding forests and sent alien birds into alien sky. Saunders was returning in a hurry, so the news probably wasn’t good, and by the time Powell had found him he was holding Lance Corporal Danny Michael in an arm lock and whispering sweet fookin’ nothings into his ear while Corporal Paul Richard just stood around holding his fookin’ dick.\n\nPowell approached the trio, by now a spectacle for the colonists, with a fairly restrained expression of being completely pissed off, striding over into their view as he demanded to know what the fook they thought they were doing.\n\nSaunders released the man as soon as he heard Powell’s voice, turning to face him with a fiercely present look in his eyes. There was focus there, with anger driving it, and Powell realised he’d have to step carefully until it passed. “Looking for you, Powell,” he replied. “Got a spare minute to deal with another lifetime of bullshit?”\n\n“More bad *fookin’*news,” Powell breathed, having expected as much and still finding himself irritated at the man’s glib insubordination in spite of having expected that as well. To calm himself he had to remind himself that this was a man who had stripped down an alien cloaking system and had provided humanity with basic notes on how it seemed to function, thus proving himself useful even if he was as fookin’ shitful as a man could be. “Fookin’ wonderful. Yeah, I’ve got a spare minute.”\n\nThey stepped into the office Powell had reserved for himself, closing the door to hide their conversation away from the colonial rumourmongers; the things that were already circulating were bad enough without the truth getting out there. Powell took his seat, knowing he’d prefer to be seated for what was to come if Saunders was being even half-serious, and looked up at the man. “Start talkin’, Saunders.”\n\nSaunders briefed him. *Properly* briefed him, his voice more level than it ever had been. The story was typically insane - a bat-girl trapped in a ping-pong ball sized computer, and what he’d learned from her. It wasn’t something that Powell would normally have believed, because who would really have thought that some fook’ed up alien version of the Matrix could actually exist? Saunders believed it, though, and more impressively when he glanced at Michael and Richard, they nodded slowly from behind Saunders’ eyeline.\n\nAccepting that also meant that accepting the kind of headache Saunders had been promising; taking a man captive was one thing, but taking his *mind* was quite another, and presented the kind of security risks he’d have preferred stayed in science fiction.\n\nSaunders finished his explanation by stating his intention to leave as soon as he possibly could. “Spot can fly,” he said, apparently having named his ship like he’d have named a dog, “Even if she’s not pretty, and I’ve got things I need to protect.”\n\n“Don’t forget our deal,” Powell reminded him. “Good faith.”\n\nSaunders nodded. “I’m going to need guns. Guns and ammunition.”\n\nThat was more than Powell was willing to simply give away, even in return for Saunders fulfilling their agreement. He’d have to be just as mad as Saunders to start handing over firearms. “I’m not handing over weapons to a crazy man without a good fookin’ reason,” he said. “Quid pro quo, remember?”\n\n“Then I might have something you find useful,” Saunders returned with a smile. “I can build you a scanner that will let you know if hunters are in the system, cloaked or not. Then you won’t be caught with your fucking pants down.”\n\nThat was exactly the sort of thing he should have been offering for free, but Powell held his tongue. There was no need to antagonise the man when simply trading away a single weapon and some ammunition would provide him with more of a return on investment than he had believed possible. The Hunters represented a serious threat to the colony, and any way they could reduce that threat was worth the risk. Besides, had he been in Saunders’ situation he’d have done the same, reserving a bartering chip just in case. He’d have reserved several, in fact, which naturally made him suspect that Saunders had done so too.\n\nIt was becoming clear that, bug-fuck though he might be, Saunders was going to be an asset. Albeit, one that would need careful handling at arms’ length.\n\nThe man may have succeeded in restoring one of the ruined ships to life, but Powell thought he would wait until he produced what he promised. “If you can build us *that*,” Powell promised, “I’ll make sure you get what you asked for.”\n\n___\n\n**Scotch Creek Extraterrestrial Research Facility, British Columbia, Canada, Earth**\n\n*If you’re interested, the escape pod is probably still where I left it, somewhere in the Monongahela national forest. I walked until I found a road, hitch-hiked to Charlottesville. Hvek and Twanri had assured me that I would be amply rewarded for my service, and they had not lied - the Swiss bank account they had made me memorise the details of contained a lavish supply of funds, more than enough to pick a town at random on the map and work my way here by Greyhound.*\n\n*Most went on this apartment, and on reinforcing it. The rest… keeps me alive, so I can tell my story.*\n\n*The only reason I tell it to you now, Mr. Jenkins, is because, as you say, entering this room has probably already doomed you.

{"body": "___\n\n**Folctha colony, Cimbrean, The Far Reaches**\n\nBack on Earth, much thought and theorycrafting had gone into the problem of supplying the soldiers for the possibility of shipboard combat, where a stray bullet could mean fatal decompression, even with the damage control fields. Options had been considered up to and including reviving kinetic pulse weaponry, but with the tactical environment now apparently including things that were similarly tough to humanity - not to mention other humans - that project had been abandoned. Again.\n\nThe fact was, the only weaponry that could reliably hurt humans, or anything that had the ability to stand up to a human in combat, was also dangerous to starships and there was no way around that. \n\n*Unless* - and Legsy was shamelessly self-congratulatory about this - you gave up on relying on the gun to be everything at once, and took a look at the ammo instead. Starships meant corridors. Corridors meant shotguns. Shotguns meant buckshot and slugs for dealing with humans, birdshot for the squishy ones. Problem solved. The smaller pellets of birdshot would have a much lower chance of damaging a starship, but were still devastating to alien flesh, and if you came across anything tougher, you just needed to use different ammo. Problem fucking solved.\n\nThe rest had involved persuading the mission planners to furnish their armory with magazine-fed SPAS-15s, which could rapidly change ammo types in response to a shifting tactical situation, rather than tube-fed M1014s which were a little less flexible. That had been easy once Powell had been convinced to back his towering celtic gun-nut comrade. Predicting the need to possibly arm the civilian colonists, the soldiers had arrived with more than they themselves could possibly use, and “losing” one of the shotguns to “Operational circumstances” seemed only reasonable considering how well Saunders had held up his end of the bargain. It went down on the paperwork as having been dismantled for spare parts, and the ammo was written off to “water damage”.\n\nPowell entered the tent that served as the camp’s armoury in time to hear Legsy ask “Watcha think, boy, reckon that’ll do?” as he handed the gun over. \n\nAdrian Saunders looked like a hundred Christmases had all arrived at once, and held the gun like it was the most wonderful thing he had ever laid hands or eyes on. Then, seeing Powell enter, he tried to sober his expression a little. “I... uh... yeah. Yeah, that'll do.\" he said, unconvincingly. \n\nLegsy grinned, handed over the ammunition and then busied himself with cleaning the Minimi that was his own weapon of choice.\n\n“The new sensors are up.” Powell said. “And a fook of a lot better than the old ones. I might just have been wrong about you being a waste of good calories.”\n\nAdrian dodged the apology. “Jen could have told you that.” He replied. \n\nThe man still nettled Powell, for all that he’d proven his obvious worth as an engineer and an expert in alien technology. He’d obviously started out as a stubborn bastard, and his experiences had only driven him *further* into his intransigent shell, even if he put up a smokescreen of flippant no-fucks-given attitude to cover it.\n\n“Jen thinks you’re dead.” he said. “Not a lot of point going into the skills and talents of a fookin’ dead man, is there?\n\nReally, he should just stop poking. Saunders was badly damaged - best to just get on with it. He exercised some willpower and resolved to stick to the facts from now on and leave his opinions out of it. Saunders might be a danger to the colony, but he’d proven he was a useful risk, and probably not worth antagonising. \n\n“Might have been worth knowing you on top of a fuckload of salvageable alien tech though, wouldn’t it?”\n\nPowell wanted to point out that the only man on the planet - the only man in the whole human race as far as he knew - that could even have identified the technology as *being* still salvageable and in working condition was Adrian himself. Jen had her own set of skills, a sharp mind and was a quick study, but she hadn’t once shown anything more than a working, user-level knowledge of alien technology.\n\nHe stuck to his resolution though and didn’t rise to it.\n\n“Your ship ready?”\n\n“Yep. *Spot*’s all ready to go, provisions are all loaded… Just need to hump the artillery here and I’m done mate.”\n\nPowell didn’t comment that Saunders was holding a bag full of shotgun shells as if it were his cricketing gear, without appearing to be really conscious of it. Even in Cimbrean’s low gravity, that was an indication of the “Alien Mutant Juice” marinating his tissues.\n\n“Good. Right now, according to those fancy sensors you set up, you’ve got a clear sky. No warp signatures within range and that’s… what, a couple parsecs or so?”\n\n“About that.” Saunders agreed.\n\n“So, you’ve got a clear run to get out of here without telling the galaxy about it, and there’s no guarantee that’s going to be true tomorrow. So, would you mind awfully-”\n\n“-fucking off?” Adrian finished, interrupting him with a grin. “Too bad, I’ll miss the food here mate.”\n\nPowell snorted, and extended a hand. After a moment’s hesitation, Saunders shook it.\n\n“Just try not to get killed you crazy fookin’ prick.” he said.\n\nAdrian grinned. “So far so good.” \n\n___\n\n**Scotch Creek Extraterrestrial Research Facility, British Columbia, Canada, Earth**\n\n“…That’s a brutal story, eh?”\n\n“And Terri Boone died after hearing it, Martin.”\n\n“Just playing Devil’s Advocate here, Kevin but… that doesn’t necessarily suggest there’s an alien conspiracy involved.”\n\n“Fuck devil’s advocate. Do you want to go extinct?”\n\n“...No.”\n\n“Neither do I.”\n\nKevin Jenkins put his phone away, expression grim. “If I’m wrong and Singh is just a crazy hermit, oh well. Sorry to have wasted the loonies, man.”\n\nHe leaned forward. “But if I’m right then one of these fuckers could be on Earth right now, looking for an opening. With stakes that high, I think maybe we should take this ‘Hierarchy’ business seriously.” he said. “Don’t you?”\n\n**++End Chapter 13++**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418265358", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 69, "controversiality": 0}

It was easily enough to make a test flight all the way out to check the Celzi escape pod to discover that its FTL drive had been looted but its Alliance navigational databanks remained fully intact, and then back to sweep the wreckage of the Allebenellin heavy troop ship.\n\nThat vessel was smaller than the Hodgepodge by a country mile, having had the better part of a year to sit around it had almost entirely sunk beneath the waves. From a distance it was all but invisible; directly over the wreckage it was possible to see the full extent of the damage through the crystalline waters.\n\nIt didn't look good, but the near complete destruction of the hull meant that gaining access was about as hard as getting into the water. On land the ship would be nearly untraversable, but submerged as it was there would be no issues with worrying whether the broken floor would take their weight.\n\n\"What's this fuckin' thing then?\" Gorge asked, squinting as he peered through the water at the dark shape below.\n\n\"Space Illuminati starship,\" Adrian answered, shrugging when the two men frowned at him. \"Not making it up.\"\n\n\"No shite?\" Cliff muttered, staring at the shattered vessel. \"Looks like it's been blown to fookin' 'ell!\"\n\n*Thank you, Sherlock,* Adrian thought sardonically. *Solved the fucking case once again!*\n\nHe flashed his winning grin at the burly man. \"Not all of it, I hope, because otherwise this will be a waste of my fucking time.\"\n\nHe dived in, leaving the two soldiers to watch his progress from above the water, back where they couldn't do any more damage to the fragile remains. Spot certainly wasn't going anywhere while he was in the water, being fully keyed to require his presence for any kind of piloting action.\n\nThe blasted corpse of the alien ship made for fast progress at least. What had been engineering was basically a large, empty space with a missing reactor and kinetic drive. What it did have was the advanced FTL drive he'd learned about on Cavaras.\n\n\"Holy fuck,\" he muttered as he took it from its casing as though it were a holy object. It was smaller than the regular drive, but sleeker and had the appearance of being ultra high-tech device he'd heard stories about.\n\nHe'd forgotten that his radio was on because the next thing he heard was Gorge's voice. \"Report?\"\n\nAdrian stared at the sacred drive, knowing how useful this kind of technology could be to Earth but at the same time not wanting to give it up. He slipped it into his bag, deciding that in this instance the rest of the human race could go fuck itself; he'd find another later on and Powell could have *that*. \"Just had a fish come out of fucking nowhere,\" he lied, giving the pair of idiots something else to laugh about. \"Startled me.\"\n\nThe disdainful grumbling on their side let him know they bought his story. There were other things worth looking for on this ship, namely an intact computer core and he was pleased to discover that it hadn't been entirely destroyed.\n\nThough its survival must have been a close thing, because the rest of the room, less well protected, was in various states of being a mangled mess or not being there at all.\n\nThen there was the thing that he did not expect; six smaller cores in a vertical rack beside the fist sized primary system.\n\n\"What the fuck are these?\" he wondered under his breath. The unit as a whole was self contained and self powered, not a redundancy and not a subsystem linking to anything on the ship. He grabbed them all, figuring that even if he couldn't open them on the standalone console in Spot, then Askit could solve the mystery at a later time.\n\nHe returned to Spot with his loot, hauling himself aboard as the pair of soldiers parted for him. \"Anythin' int'restin'?\" Gorge asked, gesturing to the full bag.\n\n\"Probably,\" Adrian said as he removed his helmet. \"Let's find out.\"\n\nThey followed him over to the standalone console, the remains of a computer core harvested from the intact half of a blown apart freighter. He hadn't connected it to the main system, having intended it for the exact kind of data theft he was doing now.\n\n\"This is the computer core from the ship,\" he explained. \"Basically it's a computer you plug into the ship and-\"\n\nThey only looked bored so he stopped talking and started working. The core showed signs of being functional, but as expected it was also encrypted, making it one for the Corti hacker. He switched it with the first of the smaller cores and found a very basic operating system.\n\n\"What the fuck *is* this?\" he wondered again, this time loud enough to attract the interest of the two goons. \"It loads... and then file not found...\"\n\nHe frowned and switched it with the next one, and the next one after that. Only the fourth he tried must have had the required file, because it loaded without throwing an error at all. \"Loads with no interface,\" he observed. \"Probably a data backup, but who the fuck knows of what?\"\n\nThe tiny speaker housed in the console broke into life, speaking his name.\n\n\"Adrian?\" it asked, its voice so familiar that Adrian felt the blood drain away from his face.\n\n\"Jesus fucking Christ,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Trix?\"\n\n\n+++++\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418273320", "subreddit": "HFY", "score": 61, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Dude, really. Aspiring gunsmith here as well. I've been wanting to do this sorta deal for a while, but costs are incredibly prohibitive and some models are most assuredly not going to fookin happen. The Shreddifier is a certain no-go, because it's somehow made of broken physics that ignore things like bolt shroud from receiver to barrel. The rounds in it must just teleport from magazine top and charmingly materialize at supersonic speed in the barrel.  \nI've had a serious lust for a Jakobs sniper for the longest time, but that crazy box magazine on it is going to be near impossible to fabricate. Unfortunately, this means we can only really make the Muckamuck style snipers, with the revolver chambers in the receiver, and we'd have to start with a working firearm at first: The Rossi Circuit Judge Carbine. If he starts with that, all he'd really need do is learn some woodcarving or engineer that wicked wingtip shoulder stock Jakobs is in love with, and find a way to machine that groovy fore end. Of course, there's the scope to steam punk the living hell out of, but that should be relatively easy. The difficult part would be in removing that teensy little barrel off the receiver, finding a 26\" barrel for 45 cal with a 1 in 18\" twist, trimming the end off it and threading the outside throat to screw into the receiver. \nSo uh, that might be a touch advanced. If he wanted to start out slow, there's another option to try and see how it comes out. Chiappa makes a shotgun called the Triple Threat, which, I'm dead serious, has three barrels. It's a dead ringer for the Bushwhack series shotguns Jakobs makes. All it needs is some serious filigree engraving, some little strips of picatinny rail here and there, and a better wood stock and fore end. Look these things up, I am not joking.\nFor that whacky stabilizer deal on Hyperion weapons...uh. I'm open to suggestions? I seriously have nothing.\nTorgue anything would be stupidly easy to make. Even the pistols, just get any old pistol anywhere, and dress it up with garish paint and a ton of scrapped CPU heat sink parts. Best give up on the idea of making real gyrojets for it, though. Actual gyrojet rifle and pistol rounds run about $15 each.\nLemme know if you have any other ideas.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418297904", "subreddit": "Borderlands", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

So you could roll up for fish-n-chips lunch, stroll around the harbour, feel the actual seals wot hang around looking for scraps, and then have dinner in O'Connells or The Brass Monkey, maybe even Okra - which is a di-fucking-vine authentic Pakistani restaurant - and then enjoy some live music in O'Connells before wobbling back to catch the last DART back into town at around 1120.\n\nNote: This entire suggested plan gets FUCKED IN THE ARSE if you get off at \"Howth Junction\" instead of \"Howth\". Howth is the last stop on the DART and it is, as mentioned, charming, safe, interesting, ancient with lovely views of the sea. Howth Junction is like the sets from Mad Max after they've been left in the desert for fifteeen years and populated by generations of rats who have learned to hunt humans.

I've genuinely had a bank account since I was 6 years old. \n\nAlso, that's such a fucking absurdly specific scenario you just created. If that happens, yes. Maybe Bitcoin will be a better fit.

{"body": "&gt;Look at every major shift in technology. Rarely do the giants of the old technology become the giants of the new technology. They fight innovation tooth and nail, seeking to milk their cash cow for everything it's worth, until someone else comes along and disrupts them.\n\nThat is wholly ignorant of the facts. Even if it was true, the disruption that arrives can work for the better. For example, Blockbuster could have purchased Netflix. Too late now, and we have a better customer experience because of it.\n\n&gt;Exxon is never going to be a leader in green energy. By the time they are ready to give up on dirty energy, someone else will have assumed that position.\n\nThen build the green company that kills them. Be the change. Yelling and Exxon won't change their minds.\n\n&gt;I imagine people that were born into 9 figure net worths have a slightly different outlook on life than the rest of us.\n\nIndeed, but not all of them are inhuman monsters. And the people funding green energy projects are, you sitting down? Rich people.\n\n&gt; The people that work there are people like you and me, but they just work there. The people that own Exxon are not people like you and me.\n\nI'm not asking you to work in their mailroom. The people that make the industry move are the companies that build their equipment and the scientists that scope out new locations for exploitation. If you were in their position with your passion you could build tools to make the change you want to see. Stop thinking the world is dire and nothing can be fixed. Things change because they must. Its a rule that can't be broken.\n\n&gt;&gt;Also, personally, stop being one of \"those guys,\" dude. I used to be one of \"those guys.\" I used to be like you as well. Someone who believed in gentle reform. I remember Bill Clinton trying to \"speak their language\" describing poorly-educated inner city children as a \"lost resource\".

This is done by taking the x and y term (numbers in front of x and y not x2 y2) dividing it by 2 and squaring it and adding it to the other side so you get x2-10x+25+y2-20y+100=0. now break it up. x2-10x+25=0 and y2-20y+100=0. Trinomial factor it (draw an x put the last number on the top and the middle number on the bottom from each equation) now you want two numbers to put in the side of the x they will be the same number and must multiply to equal the top number and add to be the bottom number so for the x one i used used -5 (-52=25 and -5+-5=-10) and for the y i used -10 (-102=100 and -10+-10=-20) so those work now to write it in factored from its simply (x-5)2+(y-10)2=0 so now just take the opposite of the number in the ( ) for the answers so x=5 and y=10 because (5-5)2+(10-10)2=0 and to check you can plug it into the original equation to find that when x=5 and y=10 it will equal -125 as the original equations says so now x+y=5+10 which equals 15.

A 14 year old neighbor got me to suck his cock and then started fucking me in the ass on a regular basis. As I remember he had a very small dick; mine was already bigger than his. I was already self-conscious about the size of my dick. In school gym the guys would comment on how my dick was much larger than theirs and I thought something was wrong with me. I even came home and told my father about it. He would just smile and assure me that everything was OK. We continued fooling around and loved the feel of his dick in my ass but that all ended soon when his mother got home one day and caught him balls deep in my young ass. She sent me home and told me to never come back, and since her son was much older, never revealed anything to my parents. Since I seemed to enjoy having my ass being plowed I should have known that I was destined to have this happen again.\nMany years passed by and I was sent to an all boys military school. Some of you may think, wow, what a fantasy, but in truth, they were so strict that the thought of having any hanky panky filled me with the greatest fear that I didn’t even dare think about it. Guys that got caught having sex were immediately kicked out. That is until my senior year; I had advanced in rank up to company commander and one of my duties was making spot bed checks to make sure no one was up to no good. It was alumni weekend and a lot of the previous year’s graduates had come back to show off their long hair and mustaches. I decided that night that I needed to make a bed check. So I put on a pair of fatigue pants, and in my bare feet, began my sneaky rounds of the barrack’s hallways. Every room had a glass window in the door, officers got to have a curtain that had to be raised during study periods and at night. The very first room I came to and snapped on the flashlight, wow! There was one of my friends with a cock up his ass and it was one of the alumnus’ cock. It was only weeks from graduation and the “deer in the headlight” look these two gave me was hilarious in retrospect. They both tried to scamper and make excuses and when they realized they had been caught red handed, or should I say red dicked, they began to beg me to forget about it and would do anything I asked not to report them.\nI should stop at this point and tell you that I am blonde haired with hazel eyes and my dick developed into a nice thick 8 inches. At the time I was a diver on the swim team and weighed about 155 lbs.; in other words, a twink. I had had just a few experiences with girls, mostly making out with the girls they shipped in from the “All Girls” schools for dances. Summers I always worked and my dates never let me get farther than heavy petting. The sight of these two guys naked, one with his cock still glistening with ass juice, and the thought of what they had been doing, filled me with lust. For some reason I threw caution to the wind and proceeded to walk over and pull down my pants. “Blow me and I won’t tell”, I said. The sight of these two at it had gotten me harder than I could imagine and when they saw my cock, both of their mouths fell open.\nI didn’t have to say anything; they knew what the deal was going to be. They both crawled over to me and then looked at each other and grinned right before the alumnus downed my cock to the balls. “Fuck”, I said; I hadn’t had anyone suck me before and my first time was down some guy’s throat. I thought I was going to cum right there. My knees buckled and my eyes rolled back from the intense pleasure. He came up for air and the alumnus looked up into my eyes, and without releasing my cock, grinned. My friend looked at him and said, “I think he’s hooked.” The alumnus started a nice slow deep blowjob that had my balls pulled all the way up in my body. That’s when my friend got up off the floor and stood next to me and started talking dirty to me. “You like having that big ole cock sucked, don’t ya? I bet no girl has sucked you like that”, he said seductively in my ear. I wasn’t going to tell him that it was the first blowjob I had ever had, I just moaned an “Hmm Hmm.” He was naked and had maneuvered himself where is hard cock was touching my hand. I was overcome with lust and couldn’t help myself; I had to touch it. It was around 6 inches but it bent strangely to the right. It was so smooth and felt so good and he just kept saying, “That’s it, you like this don’t you?” I couldn’t answer; I just squeezed him harder and moaned.” He then grabbed me by the shoulders and said that we needed to be more comfortable and started maneuvering us over to the bunk. He pushed me down onto the bed and the alumnus picked up where he had left off. I was really ready to blow my load when I felt something against my lips that distracted me. I opened my eyes and there was my friend’s cock right in front of my face. I didn’t hesitate and let him slide into my mouth. I thought I had died and gone to heaven; I had so much of a rush that all I could think of was why I had not done this before. The feeling of this cock sliding across my tongue put me in heaven. He was leaking massive amounts of precum and it tasted wonderful. Although I had been just about to blow my load, my concentration shifted to giving the first adult blowjob of my life and wanted nothing more than to make it one of his best. He let out a moan along with, “You’ve done this before!” I stopped and told him, “Not since I was 9.” He said, “Well you’re a natural.” He grabbed my hand and pulled it around to his ass and told me to fuck him with my fingers. I tried one finger, and since the alumnus’s dick had just been there, it slid right in, so I added another. He moaned and said, “That’s it, fuck my ass good you little cocksucker.” I hesitated for a moment and thought, “cocksucker, I’m no cocksucker”, in that automatic teenage reaction. Then I realized there’s a cock all the way in your mouth and all you can think about is making him cum, so what does that make you? Cocksucker I guess. My thoughts were soon interrupted, “I’m gonna blow and I want you to swallow it.” I just nodded my head and kept sucking for all I was worth. I didn’t know what had come over me; there was nothing in the world I wanted more than for him to fill my mouth with his cum. I didn’t have to wait long. I felt his cock swell in my mouth and then four or five jets started hitting my tongue and throat. I tried my best to swallow it all but I gagged and some spurted out the side of my mouth and down his cock. That was all it took for me, I had the biggest monster orgasm of my life. I think my prostrate inverted, I came so hard. The alumnus didn’t stop he just took it all. I was in heaven when they both slid up next to me. My friend looked at me and grinned and said, “Welcome to the club. There are more of us than you realize.” I just grinned and said, “More of this, I can’t wait.”\nAbout that time we heard a door open to the outside of the barracks. We all scrambled to get ourselves back together. The alumnus jumped up on the window sill, turned to give an Errol Flynn salute, and out the window he went. I went back out in the hall and turned the corner and ran straight into one of the faculty. He was on duty and had heard some strange noises from one of the open windows in my barracks and had come to check things out. I bet he heard noise, I thought. I thought quickly and stammered that I heard it as well and had come to investigate and had found nothing unusual. He told me to go on back to bed then, so I turned to walk away with my heart pounding and my knees shaking. I couldn’t believe we had almost been caught; a couple of minutes sooner and we would have been so involved we would have heard nothing. I crawled into bed and tried to calm down and as soon as I did, I thought of nothing more that what I had happened. I got hard again and masturbated to another cum, and for the first time, scooped up my own cum and licked it from my fingers. I knew I was hooked and couldn’t wait for the next time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418580207", "subreddit": "montageparodies", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

The source material (not just *Atlas Shrugged*) is fookin' dense and mostly unreadable, and the character (Ayn Rand, that is) is deeply unlikable so it's hard to find the good points that are also necessary to make a satire. \n\nRand admired the psychopathic killer [William Hickman](http://michaelprescott.freeservers.com/romancing-the-stone-cold.html), cheated on her husband with Nathaniel Branden, retaliated in a thermonuclear way against Branden himself once he left the Objectivist movement, led said movement into a cult-like status, and was perceived in general as a major asshole.\n\nSatire is meant to ridicule and bring the satirised \"back to earth\", exposing them as human and fallible. It's very hard to do that with Ayn Rand, at least in a humorous way. And the more Rand is perceived as a sort of messiah, the more her mystique grows (in words of Nathaniel Branden himself!), the harder it'll be to expose the hurt, damaged, lonely human being which was inside Rand.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418674893", "subreddit": "TrueReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

A 14 year old neighbor got me to suck his cock and then started fucking me in the ass on a regular basis. As I remember he had a very small dick; mine was already bigger than his. I was already self-conscious about the size of my dick. In school gym the guys would comment on how my dick was much larger than theirs and I thought something was wrong with me. I even came home and told my father about it. He would just smile and assure me that everything was OK. We continued fooling around and loved the feel of his dick in my ass but that all ended soon when his mother got home one day and caught him balls deep in my young ass. She sent me home and told me to never come back, and since her son was much older, never revealed anything to my parents. Since I seemed to enjoy having my ass being plowed I should have known that I was destined to have this happen again. Many years passed by and I was sent to an all boys military school. Some of you may think, wow, what a fantasy, but in truth, they were so strict that the thought of having any hanky panky filled me with the greatest fear that I didn’t even dare think about it. Guys that got caught having sex were immediately kicked out. That is until my senior year; I had advanced in rank up to company commander and one of my duties was making spot bed checks to make sure no one was up to no good. It was alumni weekend and a lot of the previous year’s graduates had come back to show off their long hair and mustaches. I decided that night that I needed to make a bed check. So I put on a pair of fatigue pants, and in my bare feet, began my sneaky rounds of the barrack’s hallways. Every room had a glass window in the door, officers got to have a curtain that had to be raised during study periods and at night. The very first room I came to and snapped on the flashlight, wow! There was one of my friends with a cock up his ass and it was one of the alumnus’ cock. It was only weeks from graduation and the “deer in the headlight” look these two gave me was hilarious in retrospect. They both tried to scamper and make excuses and when they realized they had been caught red handed, or should I say red dicked, they began to beg me to forget about it and would do anything I asked not to report them. I should stop at this point and tell you that I am blonde haired with hazel eyes and my dick developed into a nice thick 8 inches. At the time I was a diver on the swim team and weighed about 155 lbs.; in other words, a twink. I had had just a few experiences with girls, mostly making out with the girls they shipped in from the “All Girls” schools for dances. Summers I always worked and my dates never let me get farther than heavy petting. The sight of these two guys naked, one with his cock still glistening with ass juice, and the thought of what they had been doing, filled me with lust. For some reason I threw caution to the wind and proceeded to walk over and pull down my pants. “Blow me and I won’t tell”, I said. The sight of these two at it had gotten me harder than I could imagine and when they saw my cock, both of their mouths fell open. I didn’t have to say anything; they knew what the deal was going to be. They both crawled over to me and then looked at each other and grinned right before the alumnus downed my cock to the balls. “Fuck”, I said; I hadn’t had anyone suck me before and my first time was down some guy’s throat. I thought I was going to cum right there. My knees buckled and my eyes rolled back from the intense pleasure. He came up for air and the alumnus looked up into my eyes, and without releasing my cock, grinned. My friend looked at him and said, “I think he’s hooked.” The alumnus started a nice slow deep blowjob that had my balls pulled all the way up in my body. That’s when my friend got up off the floor and stood next to me and started talking dirty to me. “You like having that big ole cock sucked, don’t ya? I bet no girl has sucked you like that”, he said seductively in my ear. I wasn’t going to tell him that it was the first blowjob I had ever had, I just moaned an “Hmm Hmm.” He was naked and had maneuvered himself where is hard cock was touching my hand. I was overcome with lust and couldn’t help myself; I had to touch it. It was around 6 inches but it bent strangely to the right. It was so smooth and felt so good and he just kept saying, “That’s it, you like this don’t you?” I couldn’t answer; I just squeezed him harder and moaned.” He then grabbed me by the shoulders and said that we needed to be more comfortable and started maneuvering us over to the bunk. He pushed me down onto the bed and the alumnus picked up where he had left off. I was really ready to blow my load when I felt something against my lips that distracted me. I opened my eyes and there was my friend’s cock right in front of my face. I didn’t hesitate and let him slide into my mouth. I thought I had died and gone to heaven; I had so much of a rush that all I could think of was why I had not done this before. The feeling of this cock sliding across my tongue put me in heaven. He was leaking massive amounts of precum and it tasted wonderful. Although I had been just about to blow my load, my concentration shifted to giving the first adult blowjob of my life and wanted nothing more than to make it one of his best. He let out a moan along with, “You’ve done this before!” I stopped and told him, “Not since I was 9.” He said, “Well you’re a natural.” He grabbed my hand and pulled it around to his ass and told me to fuck him with my fingers. I tried one finger, and since the alumnus’s dick had just been there, it slid right in, so I added another. He moaned and said, “That’s it, fuck my ass good you little cocksucker.” I hesitated for a moment and thought, “cocksucker, I’m no cocksucker”, in that automatic teenage reaction. Then I realized there’s a cock all the way in your mouth and all you can think about is making him cum, so what does that make you? Cocksucker I guess. My thoughts were soon interrupted, “I’m gonna blow and I want you to swallow it.” I just nodded my head and kept sucking for all I was worth. I didn’t know what had come over me; there was nothing in the world I wanted more than for him to fill my mouth with his cum. I didn’t have to wait long. I felt his cock swell in my mouth and then four or five jets started hitting my tongue and throat. I tried my best to swallow it all but I gagged and some spurted out the side of my mouth and down his cock. That was all it took for me, I had the biggest monster orgasm of my life. I think my prostrate inverted, I came so hard. The alumnus didn’t stop he just took it all. I was in heaven when they both slid up next to me. My friend looked at me and grinned and said, “Welcome to the club. There are more of us than you realize.” I just grinned and said, “More of this, I can’t wait.” About that time we heard a door open to the outside of the barracks. We all scrambled to get ourselves back together. The alumnus jumped up on the window sill, turned to give an Errol Flynn salute, and out the window he went. I went back out in the hall and turned the corner and ran straight into one of the faculty. He was on duty and had heard some strange noises from one of the open windows in my barracks and had come to check things out. I bet he heard noise, I thought. I thought quickly and stammered that I heard it as well and had come to investigate and had found nothing unusual. He told me to go on back to bed then, so I turned to walk away with my heart pounding and my knees shaking. I couldn’t believe we had almost been caught; a couple of minutes sooner and we would have been so involved we would have heard nothing. I crawled into bed and tried to calm down and as soon as I did, I thought of nothing more that what I had happened. I got hard again and masturbated to another cum, and for the first time, scooped up my own cum and licked it from my fingers. I knew I was hooked and couldn’t wait for the next time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418819216", "subreddit": "ChivalryGame", "score": -12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It depends on the class.  There are a few distinct situations I can think of but they are always in a subjective class, especially the type where worldly knowledge can be relevant and there's room for interpretation in how to approach the topics (philosophy, sociology, psychology, literature and to a lesser extent history).\n\n1.  The **I ask really obscure questions** person. You're discussing some topic and a student asks an obscure question that requires a nuanced understanding of the topic.  He/She is not asking because s/he sincerely wants an answer, but because s/he wants to impress the teacher by showing that *they* have a nuanced understanding of the topic well enough to ask the obscure/nuanced question.\n\n2.  The **tells my life story** person.  \"As a mother/father/parent....\" \"As a [x]...\" The person uses their own experience to frame the topic at hand whether it's relevant or not.  First of all, the tangent this person goes on is almost never relevant to the topic, and second the whole point of their story is to make themselves feel/look better.  \"As a mother, when my child was sick with fever, I went to the store in the blistering cold to get medicine while barefoot and pregnant with my second child... and is that really so different from how France treated America during the American Revolutionary war?\" oO Wot M8? This person wants you to applaud them for being a good [x], and doesn't really care how their experience relates to the topic. \n\n3. The **Just doesn't get it** person.  This person just doesn't get it. They aren't showing off, but they waste a fucking ton of time and are just as annoying as the previous two.  This person will sit there and come up with a million \"but what if...?\" scenarios to complicate a very simple problem because they just don't get the point of the lecture or topic at hand.  Example: The point of the *Trolley Problem* in Philosophy is to remove bias and evaluate your intuitions over a simple problem (is it every right to use someone as a means to an end?).  If you say \"well what if the one man you push on the tracks is a doctor, and the 5 in the cave are literally 5 hitlers?\"  or \"what if the cave you redirect the train to has 1 innocent child who grows up to cure cancer and the cave with 5 has 5 terrorists?\" That muddies the problem. It adds unnecessary biases.  It completely ruins the *point* of the thought problem (to evaluate your intuitions on a simple question about redirecting or causing harm to achieve an ends)!\n\nAll of these people waste a LOT of time in a lecture.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418999944", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Can you please just shut up about genres for one single moment?\n\nSure.\n\n&gt; You aren't the genre overlord. You don't know every single genre ever.\n\nU wot\n\n&gt; Heck, you've even admitted that you're not good at genres like trap and future bass! So obviously, you've got your own labelling flaws.\n\nYeah. Not good *yet*. I 'm 14. I'm still learning.\n\n&gt; How about you look back and see what else you have mislabelled, because I guarantee this: You're not perfect with genres.\n\nI don't claim to be.\n\n&gt; You're far from it.\n\nNot really. I'm pretty damn good.\n\n&gt; Sure, you're better than me at some genres (i.e. future house vs deep house), but trust me, I know some stuff.\n\nIf you admit that I'm better at that then why were you so stubborn claiming that \"no this track would be deep hau5\" a while ago?\n\n&gt; First off, you nitpick the tiniest details. This is really what you sound like to some:\n\n&gt; \"There wasn't a beat right there... IT'S BIG ROOM! You're wrong if you think otherwise! WRONG!\"\n\nWhen do I sound like this? The lack of one beat in one measure would *never* define a genre. Saying things like this makes *you* look ridiculous.\n\n&gt; That leads me to my second point... you're hypocritical in your genres. You usually use the modern definitions of genres, such as for electro house, complextro, future house and the like. Meanwhile, you use the classical/no longer correct definition for progressive house and big room.\n\nNo. Please stop. I think you're confusing \"modern\" with \"popular\" and it's completely wrong. Any modern electro house, future house, complextro tracks would be considered such if they were made in the respective genre's early days. \n\n&gt; Sure, big room might have meant what people call progressive house today... a few years ago. But it doesn't mean that now!\n\nTerms change, and I can't deny that. The correctness of those is what really matters.\n\n&gt; Saying that one should use the classical definition even though it's not correct anymore is like saying that one should go about their day nude because the first people were nude. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd yet there are nudists who have these exact beliefs.\n\n&gt; If you're going to define genres by modern definitions... good! That's what you should be defining them by! If you're going to be defining genres by classical definitions... okay, I guess, but it's kinda out-of-date. But you can't do both.\n\nThere's some sort of logical fallacy here but I don't know what.\n\n&gt; By the way, if you define trance by modern definitions, it should be apparent that Crossroad is trance. If you define trance by classical definitions, it should be apparent that Messiah is trance. It can't be that both are wrong.\n\nNeither Crossroad nor Messiah can be considered trance by any definition of trance. Saying things like this makes you look dumb or just uneducated about trance music.\n\n&gt; Anyway, all-in-all, I think you'd be a bit better off here if you stuck to modern definitions... and even better, try to figure out why they labelled it that way rather than why it isn't that genre. Okay? I'm really wanting to help you become less of a nuisance to many people.\n\nI know why people label it as such; that's why it's important to figure out whether it's correct or not.\n\nIf you want to help me be less of a nuisance try to fix my personality, not completely fuck up meanings of genres.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419360597", "subreddit": "Monstercat", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Great, I'm stuck waiting for my girlfriend anyway, might as well bash a stranger for a few minutes to continue the cycle of ridiculousness.  \n  \n&gt;90 percent of blacks stopped and frisked were law-abiding, tax-paying citizens who had their time wasted and their piece threatened.  \n  \nCitation needed. You can't tell him not to selectively listen to facts if you are going to selectively believe uncited averages as fact.  \n  \n&gt;Moreover, your parsing of statistics is dreadfully sloppy because it implicates all blacks...  \n  \nHis parsing? Did you mean Michelle Conlin's parsing? The article didn't mention overlap of the same people counting in the statistics, the article actually didn't mention any kind of math or rules for the statistics it throws around, which is pretty typical in clickbait like this, so I'm curious how you know that the numbers are based on overlapping people vs each person counting uniquely as one. More assumption, so long as it supports your position, right?  \n  \n&gt;hardened gang members--most of whom are fed through a revolving-door criminal justice system for no particularly good reason  \n  \nLook at all the buzzwords you know! Interesting position to take here. So you are saying that gang members are fed through the justice system for no reason? Does that mean they should be left on the street? or left in prison? I thought people who were picked up for low level crime served short time as a means of both punishment and a chance to rehabilitate, seems like a pretty good reason to me. Plus I thought part of your problem was all the people being picked up for crimes they didn't commit, so which is it?  \n  \n&gt;So, are you willing to acknowledge reality  \n  \nPlease, inform us, what is reality? Is reality that more predominantly minority areas have more crime, and there for have more investigations and more suspects, meaning that more minorities will end up in the 'suspect' statistics? No surprise here. Does this mean that the justice system is racist? No. Does this mean that cops are racist? Well, they might be, but nothing in this article proves that. How many people of other races did she ask? What parts of town did she ask in? Facts inform and direct solutions, not conjecture and rhetoric.  \n  \nGrammar is different from spelling, and spelling is different from using the correct words. When you are swapping full words like 'peace' for piece, you didn't mistype something from being tired, you actually didn't know how to spell the word, or even what word you were typing. \n  \nIt's hardly pedantic to be thrown by completely incorrect words being used in a sadly over generalizing counterpoint rounded out by \"are you willing to accept reality\".

{"body": "I can see that my main point is lost on you, and I won't belabor it ;/.\n\nAs for the \"grammar is useless and arbitrary\" debate... The argument that you're making regarding one's ability to 'speak grammar' assumes that spoken and written word are somehow equivalent beyond just their functional goal. They are not, but even if they were you don't speak commas ... are you willing to argue that commas in written language don't  sometimes clarify what would otherwise be totally ambiguous?\n\nLook, I 100% get your point and I'm certainly torn at times. I'll often say that the point of language is to communicate and so as long as your chosen form of communication is understood it's acceptable while simultaneously shuddering at things like \"ur gr8 at that.\" I think that you're making the same argument I'd generally make about misspellings, but here's the thing ... in most cases you're functionally correct (as in, in most cases grammar doesn't change meaning) but that ignores a big part of the picture which is context. Context is actually influenced by *how* one communicates and what skills one demonstrates in doing so. I think things like \"u wot m8\" speak to us both in terms of content and in terms of the form which influences the context. Inherently it draws arguments around elitism and \"pseudo-intellectual pedant(ry),\" but do you really believe that \"u wot m8\" and \"you what mate\" are equivalent (regardless of if they *sound* the same when spoken)? Now, I know that's not a grammatical argument, but the point I'm illustrating is that form and function are BOTH important in that they both influence how one's message is perceived. Tell me that you don't harbor any judgement based on what society has taught you is correct vs incorrect. Do you *hear* someone sagging their pants the same as someone wearing a tuxedo? Be honest! Context matters, and how someone chooses to communicate (according to the rules, ignoring the rules, or being ignorant of the rules) is part of context. I think this point is well illustrated by your willingness to place a bunch of negative interpretations on folks that insist grammar is important. To you, it says: \"pseudo-intellectual pedant\" which almost certainly influences how you hear and interpret that person ... right?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419458306", "subreddit": "iamverysmart", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

People not acting like selfish assholes when they're not even wired to do so and they're not encouraged to be greedy?

In addition, independent self-construals **among the upper class (22) may shape feelings of entitlement and inattention to the consequences of one's actions on others** (23). A reduced concern for others’ evaluations (24) and increased goal-focus (25) could further instigate unethical tendencies among upper-class individuals. Together, these factors may give rise to a set of culturally shared norms among upper-class individuals that facilitates unethical behavior.](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/11/4086.full)\n\nHow could that possibly be?\n\n***\n&gt; You really think that the majority of people even give a fuck about you at all?\n\nFun facts:\n\n* Trust in others is greater in societies with more economic equality ([src](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/inequality/Seminar/Papers/Rothstein1.pdf)).\n\n* Socioeconomic class has a highly predictive negative correlation with ethical behavior and a positive correlation with greed ([src](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/11/4086.full))\n\n* Reduced violent crime is predicted to induce higher social efficacy ([src](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5328/918.full)) and violent crime is a function of socioeconmic status ([src](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf))\n\nNot me personally because most don't know I exist, but perhaps the ethereal other I'm part of that is \"humanity\". And they most likely would if socioeconomic conditions allowed them to.\n\n***\n\n&gt; I can never ever ever ever see anything mostly left, especially communism, ever working in a population bigger than an decently populated city, much less an entire nation.\n\nCommunists, especially anarcho-communists, are internationalists, and the latter are staunchly anti-nationalist. Marx and Engels said it best - \"the working men have no country.\"\n\nMinutiae aside, this weak argument can be falsified with concrete examples.\n\n* Much of the Mexican state of Chiapas is under directly democratic control of the people with the defense of the Zapatista Army for National Liberation ([EZLN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation)) since 1994.\n\n* If industrial society is your fancy, take a gander at the national network of [fábricas recuperadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management#The_f.C3.A1bricas_recuperadas_movement) in Argentina. Other nations have high concentrations of recovered workplaces, including Spain and Greece.\n\n* The Free Software Movement, international in scope, is one of the best examples of a gift economy I can point to.\n\nAnd note, all these movements emerged rather quickly due to groundswell to meet the needs of their working classes within the pressures of global capitalism. *This* is important to remember. The deck is stacked against them, yet they survive.\n\n&gt; Sooo many people have different views and desires.\n\nMost people are liberals of some form and like representative democracy. Radicals on either side have their ups and downs, but this is a hold-out from multiple revolutions which ended in representative democracy over the past two centuries starting with the American and French revolutions.\n\nAlso, in the sociophysics field of opinion dynamics, it's demonstrated that you only need [about 20% of individuals](http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0504017.pdf) to be committed to an opinion for majority consensus to eventually (but rather swiftly come) in general, and [only 10%](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033215) are needed in some specific, densely-connected social networks. So another revolution isn't too difficult.\n\n***\n\n&gt;  It's the way everyone thinks, i.e., trying everything and anything to get what you want. That's how it has always been and will always be. You are fooling yourself if you think otherwise.\n\nI refer you to the material I laid out earlier.\n\n***\n\n&gt; u wot m8\n\nMate, you said greed is what drive the world. I'm pretty sure that includes human societies.\n\n***\n\n&gt; So everyone has to have the same mindset as you in order to move forward? They need to cooperate and share there work with everyone else? And any one who opposes is wrong?\n\nWhen did I *ever* say this?\n\n&gt; [You are greedy whether you realize it or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWsx1X8PV_A)\n\nThere's so much wrong with this.\n\n* Ford benefited from managerial studies before him and capital accumulated over hundreds of years. Einstein benefited from all of physics, especially the works of Rutherford and Lorenz.\n\n* Capitalism by the early 20th century in Europe and the United States was protectionist, and all of the West saw increasing state intervention during and after the Second World War. However, the post-colonial Global South has had free trade - then and now.\n\n* State intervention in the marketplace isn't communism, it's just [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism). I'd imagine Soviet commissars were *very* greedy.\n\nFriedman, in this video, ignores the systemic plight of the Global South to paint a pretty, Western picture.\n\n***\n\n&gt; Life and society don't work without greed and competition.\n\nI refer you to the answer I gave earlier: *This is an example of something people do a lot - they derive universal claims about the world that only are true due to particular circumstances.*\n\n***\n\nI've exhausted over 6000 characters at this point.

And I would be, but I don't have a 720p screen. \n\nI don't even know what you're trying to say with this. I'm talking specifically about upcoming and recent games and primarily Bloodborne. Bloodborne **will** be played on screens that support 1080p and 4k. If it's rendered at 720p instead of 1080p, then yes, it **will** look worse, *especially* on a 1080p display. Yes, some games can look nice in low resolutions. Third person action games are not such games.\n\n&gt;I don't see how pong or retro looking games or older 3D games should not be played on high resolution screens since I think the argument \"it looks ugly/is unplayable\" has no value.\n\nWot m8? My entire argument is NOT that games SHOULDN'T be played on high resolution displays, my argument is that if you lower the resolution or framerate enough, it DOES become unplayable. You're drawing comparisons to old and outdated hardware and software and trying to tell me it's the same as new releases. That's bullshit. Games are games no matter when they're played, sure, but that doesn't excuse shitty hardware or lazy programming (I'm looking at you AC:U). If games for next-gen and PC were made next year and rendered at 240x160 resolution and you tried to play them on your 60 inch TV, you'd be pretty pissed. If you played it on your gameboy advance, fine, you'd be satisfied, but that's not what I'm talking about.

There were too many to identify his own works amongst them, but if this was the fool tasked with destroying his One Ring, then he'd brought it straight to him.

Mike, a skinny but sturdy looking chap,  shrugged his shoulders and swat at it, but he missed.  \"Get it! Get it! Bugs freak me out!', cried Molly. Getting annoyed by the fly as much as by Molly. Mike upped his fly crushing game.  After three wild swings he nailed the fly and Molly in her eye.  Molly was not a small girl and did not take anything from anyone, ever.  \"whhhaarrgh!  What the fuck is your problem, asshole?\" shrieked Molly.  \"I'm just doing what you told me to do jackass,\" growled Mike.  She threw her red wine onto his white shirt and grabbed the bottle and hit him square in the face.   Mike howled in pain as the bottle had broken his nose and sprayed blood all over the table and onto the couple next to them.  The gentleman, a tall dark, and handsome type,  had seen Mike hit Molly and was approaching.  He stops temporarily, flicks the blood form this cuffs, and proceeds to grab Mike as he screams, \"You wot, mate?\"   He starts to shake Mike like a piece of chicken in a flour bag.  Molly grabs her steak knife and stick it right into the gentleman's back as he drops Mike and goes to his knees.  Mike sprawls off of the floor and knees the gentleman in the face and knocks him out cold.  Mike starts screaming at the top of his lungs, \" Fuck you, Captain Save-A-Ho!\"  as he delivers blow after blow with his heel to the gentleman's head in a jack hammer like fashion.  All in the commotion, the lady who looks like a goddess walking with mortals,  with whom he was eating dinner with casually walks behind the mesmerized Molly.   The lady whispers, \" You should have trusted your instincts,\"   Molly and slits her throat with a razor. Molly drops to the floor unnoticed as the lady glides smoothly  behind Mike  and drops him too.  With his time coming to an end quickly, and gasps and with the air left in his lungs, he asks  the lady in a barely audible rumble, \"Wh-who *chhh* are y-you? \"  She smiles ever so faintly and says, \" My name is Gillette.

{"body": "Iceiceice comfirmed that RTZ is pissed at Fear for knocking out Zai, but Zai impregnated a girl that he dated with his super viking semen. This whole thing was also comfirmed by ixmike 2 random other streamers, 4 sailors, 2 jehova's witnesses and a cableguy that witnessed the impregnation. Zai was shouting ''FUS RO DAH, I will show you valhala'', as Fear got taunted by his Viking battleroar which lead to fist fight of epic proportions but Zai has lost all his energy due to impregnation focus . Meanwhile Babaevsky somehow senses this cataclysmic event and starts flaming Fear telephaticly(on team speak) as Fear is beating the beard out of Zai's chin. Fear's fury knows no bounds but he somehow manages to calm himself before poping a blood vessel as two valkyries lift zai to BjorkBjork(Sweeden) where he will slumber and feast to regain his mighty viking str.  As serenity drops upon Fear he realises that he might has made a mistake. He is left in the darkness of his own house, alone.. What happend? Fear seems confused.. Why did any of this happen? He rests on his desk confused and trembling.\nTurns out that the girl has been impregnated by some mysterious person who masterminds this whole event with his sharp as a ''dager'' intelect. This epiphany of great sadness comes to Universe, the all knowing one as he comfronts the Sithlord peterpandam with the words.\n''u did wot m8, why shag feer's grill'' . Ppd is silent as he sits on his golden throne of observer wards. Black cowl sits on his head as he gestures the ''All knowing one'' to come closer. Universe cant recognise his comrade anymore as he clearly slipped into madness. Ppd is silent. Universe activates his haste rune and starts running to the mid lane to tell Babevsky about this. But something happens light steps in the room as Babaevsky teleports between ppd and Universe.\n''Fear beat Zai into Odin's sleep. I dont think we can attend in vegas'' Babaev cries.\n''ppd did dis Babaev'' slowly says Universe ''this is his doing, he impregnated Lina, but we all know she is not 'core' material anyway.''  Babevsky starts crying. Everyone is silent.  As anger overcomes Babaevsky he tries to attack ppd, but he forgets that he is protected byy master drafter's aura of +3 armor. Ppd finaly tries to communicate with his 'past' brother's. \n\"I liek Lina'' he says. ''Fear does not deserve her... This is my last grand throw'' . \n\nAnd this is why EG is shuffling players.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420020738", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 169, "controversiality": 0}
