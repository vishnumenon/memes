Which you still have yet to show me.\n\n&gt; that's not a stereotype, that's literally not in indian tradition/culture.\n\nYes you are stereotyping indians, I never said you were stereotyping their culture, I said you were stereotyping the RACE.

{"body": "A stale, overused formula combined with terrible PR run by what I can only assume have the mental capacity of a goldfish. Their games are becoming more and more predictable each year, and with every subsequent release you notice a clear drop in quality. \n\nAside from their software releases, Ubisoft has just been making unfathomably idiotic mistakes topped with even worse PR. I can't even properly put into words how badly Ubi's PR department (if they even have one, at this point I honestly don't even know) has screwed up in this past year alone.\n\n*Watch Dogs* was viewed by many as the spear head of the eighth generation and the poster child for what the new consoles could do. It became apparent upon release that it was all an illusion, and that Ubisoft had pulled the wool over everyone's eyes with flashy visuals that did not represent the final product in order to goad them into spending their money without knowing what the actual product would be like. That's just scummy, but not a move exclusive to Ubisoft.\n\nThen we find out the \"E3\" settings were on the PC version all along, and Ubisoft purposely handicapped that port so console gamers wouldn't feel bad about purchasing an inferior machine. You could say it wasn't all the way there, and that modder \"The Worse\" had to do some work. Yeah, he did. But that's one guy. Ubisoft had the settings, they had the manpower, and they even had extra months to implement it. To honestly believe they didn't purposely handicap their own game is just wilful ignorance.\n\nBut that's not even the best part! Just days later, Major Nelson dropped this gem: \"So even out of the box, even day one, we just stuck the code on the new consoles and we were able to dial it all the way up. So as a console player you’re already getting by far the best version we can ship.\"\n\nHow can he seriously say that after gamers can see clear as day they purposely kneecapped the PC version of their game? To make a statement like that so close to such a controversy is nothing short of sabotage, it's so damn stupid.\n\nFast forward to now. I'm skipping over some stuff (\"we can't implement female characters\") but not too long ago, we got Unity. *Assassin's Creed: Unity* represents the full devolution of a franchise through annualisation, and it's probably only downhill from there.\n\nHowever, that's not even the biggest issue. They continue to outright lie to their consumers. We've already seen that Ubisoft is willing to sabotage their own product to placate ill-informed consumers, so imagine our shock when Unity is locked to 900p/30fps to, and I quote: \"avoid all the debates and stuff\". Yep. They purposely held their own game back in a significant way because... of people complaining on message boards and forums? I'm sure it has nothing to do with you being unable, right? I mean, if that were the case, all you'd have to do is include framerate lock option, just like Naughty Dog has done with *The Last of Us: Remastered*. Then, of course, they have the unbelievable nerve to say they never handicapped all versions of the game to achieve some false sense of parity. \n\nU wot m8? You \"locked\" the game to avoid debates, then you say you never handicapped your game? It's one or the other. This is a clear cut example of Ubisoft being caught in a bold faced lie. Ubisoft is a game development monolith. They know how to make a game, they just don't want to do it right. Remember Ready at Dawn's asinine statement that they **intentionally** chose 30FPS over 60FPS (because we totally could, we swear) to make their game more \"cinematic\"? The same thing is happening here. The current generation isn't meeting expectations, the developers simply don't have the tech to keep up with the massive gap between Xbone, PS4 and PC respectively, and they're trying to cover it up by pretending like an objective technical inferiority is somehow an artistic choice. No it's not. You know the difference between 30 and 60. You don't want your customers to know.\n\nTake a look at the statements made in this article: http://www.techradar.com/us/news/gaming/viva-la-resoluci-n-assassin-s-creed-dev-thinks-industry-is-dropping-60-fps-standard-1268241\n\nNearly every statement is either an outright falsehood or bold faced lie. Comparisons to *The Hobbit* are just useless misdirection; movies and games have different framerates because they are not the same medium. In an animated video game, the higher the framerate, the better. It really is as simple as that. He claims 60 is hard to reach, which is just pathetic. You can have twice the framerate on a PC for the same cost as an Xbone. He's creating a false dichotomy by saying 30FPS allows them to crank everything else up to \"maximum\", but they've already gone on record as saying they explicitly did not crank up their game to maximum on purpose.\n\nDoes anyone really think for a second this guy believes what he's saying? They're smarter than that. They don't want their consumers to be, because a smart consumer would be very bad for Ubisoft's current business model.\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR What did they do? They lied straight to our faces, tried to cover it up with more lies, and are now trying to hold an entire industry back by dragging everyone down to their level. Looking at what they've said and done, it's hard to honestly see why anyone wouldn't be extremely pissed off or at the very least, sickened to such a point they'd want to avoid their products altogether.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420156181", "subreddit": "truegaming", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

ISPs are not throttling Riot, because the game probably takes about 5-10 kilobytes per second to play, if those kilobytes were throttled, everyone would have massive ping issues, not small spikes.\n\nYou have to go through a massive amount of hops to get to Riot's server from here. The more hops you have, the more chances you have to lose packets. If a route has high congestion, the chance is even higher. This is why some ISPs reroute your packets through a longer route; otherwise the whole thing would fall apart. Even electricity has issues like this, this is why you build proper infrastructure and transformers to not blow up shit with differing voltage. But you need cash to do that.\n\nRiot, instead of investing money in a solution that works, are pointing fingers at ISPs and telling them to fix it themselves. If anything, it has to do with Riot being so stubborn that they are extremely reticent to moving the servers anywhere else than towards the Pacific Ocean.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420174754", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

They need to make better big green creatures. (I actually still want my 'green Akroma' with vigilance, reach, hexproof, trample, and deathtouch, but Genesis Hydra and Hornet Queen are pretty good, I guess.)\n\n* They need to reprint [Master of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1534)! It would be so great for my wolf deck! (No it wouldn't. The card is terrible, but I have a copy anyway.)\n\n* I'm trying to make an X-Men themed deck for my friend for Christmas, and all the Cyclops cards are terrible! (Seriously, with Eye Gouge in standard, they really should have printed a ridiculous, pushed Legendary Cyclops.)\n\n* WotC bought D&amp;D, and 15 years later they still haven't had even a one-off crossover product. 2014 was the 40th anniversary of D&amp;D. There should have been something for we players who like both games.\n\n* Wild Mongrel is a hound. Should be a wolf.\n\n* Onslaught block wizard tribal was too feeble in the face of Starstorm and goblin rush.\n\n* Kamigawa block at least brought us ninjas. But I would have liked to have some more. (I hope that after Sarkhan brings dragons back to Tarkir, he takes the Mardu and planeswalks them to invade Kamigawa en masse, Mongol-horde-style.)\n\n* Ooh, Lorwyn has Wren's-Run Packmaster! Thank you WotC! Wolf tribal kinda works. Now we just need it to be Standard viable.\n\n* Seriously, Zendikar was practically a D&amp;D crossover itself. The Eberron setting even has a crazy continent called Xen'drik. Hell, now I want to run an adventuring party through Zendikar to find the Eye of Ugin.\n\n* Oh, and, um, mana screw sucks.

Well At least until Draenei was nerfed because honestly it was ludicrous. But I mean trolls doing 10-15% more dps because troll was like... wot m8? Levels of stupidity. \n\nI didn't know that about ToGC because I actually haven't cleared it on my horde toon yet, wow that's just bad design overall.\n\nBut how about the horde symbols posted in the shrine of the seven stars eh? They took out most of them in 5.2 but there's 1-2 that are still there. They also fixed the bug in the bank at 5.2 where there was just a visible hole through the floor on the treasure pile that you couldn't get into. Then compare the ambient and backgrounds of SoSS to So2M there's like bookcases and statues and water features everywhere in the horde shrine. The alliance has just enough stretched over to almost compensate for the room size.\n\nI'd've liked Siege of Orgrimmar if we were raiding the Horde not the TRUE HORDE. I actually disliked just about everything from SoO. Copy pasta models everywhere, out for a year, makes the Horde players feel bad in an expack that sucked for alliance. Resulting in both sides feeling like shit at the end.\n\nEnd cinematic in SoO, every single horde leader and just humans with a dash of ~~dwarf~~ Nightelf for alliance. The part where you can talk to the leaders didn't even have every alliance leader. They were just not included entirely, like they didn't even help out with SoO and said \"meh we got other stuff to do.\" Like Draenei and Worgen were entirely excluded from SoO. Also Jaina goes insane.\n\nPersonally I think racials should just be off for any kind of structured pvp, it only makes sense. Also DAE remember 20 second will of the forsaken.

{"body": "&gt;Ah but horde had the best PvE racials from vanilla to now. Alliance racials were no where near horde racials in PvE. Well At least until Draenei was nerfed because honestly it was ludicrous. But I mean trolls doing 10-15% more dps because troll was like... wot m8? Levels of stupidity.\n\nWhich is a valid point, and just as stupid. But they tried to help with that this expac, but I don't remember them doing 10-15% more DPS other than on ToT, which was more of an oversight type of thing with certain bosses due to their 4% increased damage buff. \n\n&gt;But how about the horde symbols posted in the shrine of the seven stars eh? They took out most of them in 5.2 but there's 1-2 that are still there. \n\nThat's just Blizzard being lazy and copy/pasting the two shrines. They didn't put the horde symbols first. They just copy/pasted the two places.\n\n&gt;Then compare the ambient and backgrounds of SoSS to So2M there's like bookcases and statues and water features everywhere in the horde shrine. The alliance has just enough stretched over to almost compensate for the room size.\n\nI just logged onto both my horde and ally 90s in Shrine to compare. None of that is true really. Both Horde and Ally shrines are basically equal, with a few small differences. For instance, the \"water\" you're talking about is a single fountain inside the second level, where the alliance has a little shrine with incense and more people standing in front. Both details are there. The books and what not are the same for both sides. Shrine of SoS and 2M are basically the exact same thing just swapped. \n\n&gt;I'd've liked Siege of Orgrimmar if we were raiding the Horde not the TRUE HORDE. I actually disliked just about everything from SoO. Copy pasta models everywhere, out for a year, makes the Horde players feel bad in an expack that sucked for alliance. Resulting in both sides feeling like shit at the end.\n\nWhatever your opinion on it in that, the fact still is there that we literally raided the horde capital city. \n\n&gt;End cinematic in SoO, every single horde leader and just humans with a dash of dwarf Nightelf for alliance. The part where you can talk to the leaders didn't even have every alliance leader. \n\nIt's because the Horde was in org, and it was falling apart from the inside out. They could've included more alliance heads yes, but it wasn't 100% needed. The Horde was because they made a new warchief, and were taking down their old one. The other Alliance leaders, Velen and Genn, don't really leave their places either, as Velen is a peace keeper, and Genn is just kind of outside everything. The Horde leaders didn't even really say anything. \n\nAnd while the horde leaders WERE there, the Alliance is literally discussing *dismantling the Horde right then and there.* Basically saying \"you can fuck them right now\" but tries to make Varian out to be captain righteous by having him let them go. \n\n&gt;Personally I think racials should just be off for any kind of structured pvp, it only makes sense. Also DAE remember 20 second will of the forsaken. O_O\n\nAs do most pvpers. But until Blizzard actually does this, the complaint stands. I even think Alliance and Horde should be allowed to fight together in an Arena. Make it lore related by having them \"fight for the ogres\" or something.

I like it because it has *more* content, and is a lot less clunky. As far as the legs broken bug, I only get that in the fire station tower, and will admit, it is annoying, but back in mod days, you used to break your legs simply by opening doors the wrong way (Remember the swing gates?), and we didn't have splints back then. You had to crawl to the hospital, hope you had a makarov or something by then, break the glass, then get a morphine. Because you opened a door wrong.

{"body": "I actually disagree personally. I found the combat to basically be WoW with lightsabers but missing the incredible feedback (Plus the boring talent system) that WoW has (Come on, Jedi and Sith Warrior is basically WoW's warrior, they even have charge, heroic strike and rage mechanics), and the dialogue options to be even -more- binary than Mass Effect's.\n\nStory time; I wanted to play a not-so-evil bounty hunter. But the game frequently forces me to either be a complete holier-than-thou goody two shoes or an absolute prick. For example in an early mission I was told by a woman to stop her husband taking away her son, as she wanted him to be a sith but he did not. On finding the father and son I would have -liked- to convince him that letting his son train to be sith would be beneficial, y'know, get what the mother wants without going off the end... which is what the game wanted me to do. It gave me the option of either lying to the mother and letting them go free OR to straight up kill the father and kidnap their son.... u wot? Really?\n\nAnd this repeats over and over for the entire game. The class quests are -somewhat- better but the side missions are 9/10 like the example above. At times I even have instances where what is clearly a pair of non-evil choices (Give meds back to soldiers or give to people who need it)  still somehow get funneled into good or evil (Apparently giving the dying people the meds counts as evil for some reason, wtf).\n\nThen we have group missions in the world. This would be fine... if I could use the world chat, surprise, you can't unless you pay up (At least until the tenth lv iirc). Sure it's only temporary but it made things a royal pain.\n\nSure, it's a free single-player RPG, but at times it's a pretty damn poor one in my opinion.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420376695", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Canada was hit the lightest. Compulsory French education from Grades 4-9 meant that most people were still able to communicate with each other. Sadly, the entire country suddenly turning Francophone fed the egos and smug attitudes of the Québécois even more, as if they weren't insufferable already. However, it was a small price to pay for the survival of the country.\n\nAmerica, on the other hand, quickly divided itself. On the east coast, segregated communities quickly sprang up. The vast pool of immigrants and their descendants meant that almost everybody spoke a second language, from German to Chinese. The east coast was divided, but still somewhat functional. On the west coast, Chinese and Spanish quickly took hold. Almost everyone spoke one or the other, and it was this part of North America that weathered \"the silencing\" the best. And the Midwest? Well, a bunch of newly made strangers and a bunch of guns. You can guess what happened there.\n\nWhen \"the silencing\" hit, many Irishmen already spoke fluent Gaelic and many more eventually learned. The same happened to the welsh, although in the initial chaos of the silencing, many had apparently tripped pants down and fallen into sheep. Almost all of Southern England stopped functioning, with exception to the immigrants who spoke their mother tongues. They have still not fully recovered and may never do so. As for northern England and Scotland, the most peculiar thing happened. Apparently \"u wot m8\", \" 'av a go lad\", and \" o'il hook u rite in the gabber m8 I swaer on me mum\" didn't count as English.

{"body": "I started as a noob and fought my way to 4k+ in the old days after this new all hero challenge came i completed it on rank to increase my knowledge about all heros (I know its my own fault but i wanted to train in a more compeditive environment) and dropped to 3,4k. I tryed really hard o rise up again but it seems that I can not rise cause I'm not 2k above this pool to carry a feeding team but good enough to be rated as team strongest player to carry the team. but im losing like duck... its not fair o lose collective mmr in my opinion. cause if your unlucky like me your dropping wih the bad players even if you doing good....you wont be able to play in a better environment to improve.\n\nmy observation: 1. I'm 85~% blue or pink when I solo and aren't mach up with a stack on the team that im at. so i believe its sure not about random nor mmr wise but about performance at last game and some extra hidden mmr pool to determine a balancing. (I dont think its random when Im that often blue or pink) 2. If I perform poor 1-2 games im dropping from blue/pink to lower 3. the better i perform in a game the worse my teammates get in the next one. keep in account that all player are at same mmr!\n\nmy approach to rise as top player in team: -play carry: you got 3 more carries + mid; or you got mostly feeding cores beside you. play mid: you got mostly feeding cores beside you while you mostly be on paar with the opponent mid. play offlane: you got feeding cores beside you. play support: your game is lost if not the next best player taking the main cores or you are the solo support cause second went semi-carry jungle\n\nthe worst part is you cant mostly play any cores as best player cause they are allways picked first by lowest one and you cant ultilise your potential. even if you are a support player you wotn have much fun to support those who do so bad and wotn listen to you.\n\nthe proplem im facing in this pool: let determin blue is best und orange is worst in team. -the lowest players allways (instant) pick main cores(mid and carry) but they cant do proper lasthits or deny. they get overhelmet by opponent they are facing. -they have ultra ego and wont listen to anything you say, you can be as nice as you like they dont listen. example: me to second support: pls help me buy support stuff. he:no. me: at last pls go on some disabel items like euls. he: no i need dagon. - next thing i notice in this pool is that whatever role my mates have they go for dmg items. never saw any kind of disables or buying smoke themself. - when you play carry and face invis hereos you need to buy detection yourself cause the supports are rushing acane boots - witch lead us to they contest they lasthit of carry instat of go pulling camps, harass, zone out or go gang. - they have no knowledge about positioning or prio to focus - they do not understand your decisions - they chasing enemy until they are easy prey and die. - they allways want to fight even if they lost 3 teamfights in a row. - they have no knowledge about counter and weakness. - no map awareness - and attempt to run solo and o me the enemy got mostly the better cut about there mates.\n\nvalve should realy rethink about this matchup approach! things need to change! maybe they can rate the performance at the game or let it as it is but add a thumb up/down for others (who arent int your party) to rate your performance and add/degrease extra mmr. the proplem with the collective mmr is that those who do bad dont feel responsible for the lost and they dont care about their behavior and might feed the enemy on purpose cause they are pissed and lsoe the game that migth have been able to be won. if we had individual mmr gain/lose people might behave themself and reflect on their errors and try a better approach. like wont play core if they know there are better cores in team or just listen to the team to act as one. collective mmr its like beeing anonym - you dont care what you do and what you say cause they wont know who you are. have individual mmr is like - they know your identity and you behave yourself cause you dont want bad lights shining on you and match up with the worst.\n\npls uprate for valve to notice we want changes, at last I do!\n\n**no copy pasterino**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420471495", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm pretty sure your vision of the game is wrong. And that's very good news for you.\n\nLet me explain, you seem to understand dota, the items and farming, etc ... From HoN you probably have better reflexes than 99% of Dota players, and solid farming mechanics. \n\nOn the other hand, let's be honest, most of your build are complete shit. And I say that because, if you manage to win with that ... you would stomp with the correct items.\n\nFor example, your necro headress to dagon ... what ? \nOne of the most easy build on necro is to just rush meka, and become a healing machine, also meka resolves your problem of armor in early game. Don't hesitate to go teamplay on necro, meka, urn, bloodstone, are efficient items on this hero to help in teamfight, survive and push. Also they all give tanking, which is the best way on necro to carry. Snowballing with a dagon is an option, but honestly it just relies on a skill gap between you and some players of the enemy team, and that's never a good idea in the long run.\n\nAnd overall, you seem, like many players, to care way too much about having many items, and especially doing a lot of damage.\nYou do gimmicky items often, like travel, dagon or eul, when those are often situationnal or mid-lategame items, and in most cases you're missing HP or just a bkb. \n\nLet's take some concrete examples,\n\n\n- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1141231346 You should have a wand for sure here, and have went bkb instead of lifeleach and all your other stuff. I mean it's cool to have lifeleach, but just being harder to kill and able to take out one target (like silencer) is important with DK. Also BKB prevents PA from blinking on you, it's pretty big. On this hero, confort is often suicide, lifeleach and such is cool, but you can rarely rush it. I advice treads-wand-drums and then to addapt on him. I've a decent winrate with him if you wanna check my builds http://www.dotabuff.com/players/5901147/matches?date=&amp;faction=&amp;hero=dragon-knight&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;duration=\n\n- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1141173372 Doom is a hero that needs to adapt, and even if vlad is cool, often you want to get something making you really usefull. Here, just replacing that with a dagger could have changed everything, since you could have just blinked and doom silencer straight. Since I believe he must have been a big Issue in fight. With one less hero and no silence to fuck  WR or Skywrath, you could have gotten more in early game.\n\n-  http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1126317829 Maelstrom first is shit, period. Maelstrom isn't a bad item, mjolnir is often great as a 3rd or 4th item. But first, it bring nothing you need, on most heroes. Wr can benefit a lot from just phase boots, a wand (here you have bottle so wand isn't that important but I  like it on her) , and a force staff or a meka, and your hero would have been much more potent in fights. You seem to focus on yourself when you clearly are the one that should make \"supporting\" stuff.\n\n- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1048062688 You should have a bkb or a HoT here, the fact you didn't do any tanking or protecting is very wrong, I mean against their team you need a bkb for sure, otherwise you're dead. No matter if some of theit ultis go through, in bkb you're much harder to kill, even while disabled,  than with a butterfly and 1200 hp.\n\nAnd, honestly, in many of your wins you could have done different items and just STOMP\n\n- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1126419058 Get meka and bloodstone or aghs and you would have won way quicker\n\n- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1118606161 Never do eul on leshrac, rush bloodstone or aghs if you wanna damage, force staff or meka if you wanna support. Also I don't understand why you have travel and eul and no bloodstone. Leshrac is a pusher-teamfighter, not a racing car. Also what the hell with your skill build. Maxx diabolict edict or don't take it at all, one level in early is far from efficient in terms of mana. Maxxing your stun in early is also important to have the max radius.\n\n- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1081114281 Vlad first on alche ? Get a bkb, get a dagger, get a shadow blade, get a mekasm ... the hero can have insane impact in early with the right items, NOT vlad. Again, confortable but non needed. And really, if you want armor just do a mekasm, it can have insane impact at your level, when people never make any +hp, since you'll heal big portions of their life at once. Even medaillon can be great on him, medaillon + urn can be a decent way of supporting early and still have stats that are cool for you. Then you can get bkb and then mjolnir, and have a very decent hero who still had nice impact eatly on. Edit - Also, you didn't take your stun before level 8 ? you wot mate ? Take one level in greed MAX before level 7 or 8, if you get dagger or shadow blade you need to get 2 or 3 points in stun, but even then, you always need a point early on, this spell is very strong, especially compared to greed ...\n\n\nI won't go further because there's already a lot. Don't mind the attacks, it's mostly sarcasm, I  honestly think you're a decent player who can improve a lot, just work on your items and skill builds, try to be more teamplay or teamfight oriented, also change your gameplay based on that, and you'll have much more sucess.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420479742", "subreddit": "learndota2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

There coulda been more character stuff, sure, but it did *so much more* so well. It looks and moves beautifully and has an actual soundtrack that helps tell the story, which I can say about approximately one Marvel film ( I havent seen GotG though. )\n\nI dont think a lot of critics were fair to this thing. They faulted it because Nerd Clark didnt show up til the end, or Lois's hair is red, or that a movie about alien Supermen in battle has internally consistent levels of 'destruction' or any number of other inane objections I've seen which only betray the fact that a generation would not let the thing be itself independently from Donner/Lester's films. \n\nMoS is a *good start*. It's got some of the most exquisite Superman moments [caught on screen yet.]( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jSjI7gwuKtg) They brought a viscerality to Superman that hasn't been seen before. Put an Oscar-winning screenwriter in the mix and you have the reasons why Mikeahya's optimistic about BvS.\n\nEdit : Yall can dv me all ya want - wait and see. BvS only needs *build* on the foundation already set. Make that same movie, something that moves and looks and sounds as beautiful as MoS with a bit more spark and wit in the script - and throw in the Batman - and it will be a cracker.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420515471", "subreddit": "movies", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

To be tangled by the tiniest of feelings. The old tiger never looked away from Moe's eyes. To Moe, the tiger's eyes looked so human. \n\nEven more than his older brothers. \n\nMoe gripped the tranquilizer dart on the thickly furred neck, fingers twitching with hesitation. Could he pull?\n\n\"Look at him. Just a fucking cat. Remember when we cut our first cat, Eenie?\" Meanie's teeth flashed in the dark.\n\nEenie stood up as he wiped his hands on the struggling tiger's frame. \"Yeah we did her good.\"\n\n\"Her?\" Meanie said, confused.\n\n\"Well, didn't matter which hole there, eh? Just a *fucking* cat.\" Eenie laughed like a hyena.\n\nMoe looked down at the zoo's concrete floor. A moment passed before Miny roughly grasped his little brother's arm. \"We weren't there...we were too young.\"\n\nThe tiger then looked at Miny.\n\n\"'Ey, you wanna have first push at...wotcha wanna call it, Meanie?\"\n\nMeanie unzipped his trousers. \"Don't matter since it won't speak more than the last one.\"\n\nEenie cocked his head, confused. \"Last? Oh, ya mean the bird back at Wegman's.\"\n\n\"No, that was ages ago. It was the tight cunt in...oh, fuck. It was today at this fooking zoo. Jesus, even 'er mouth was tight. Tighter! Haha!!\" Meanie giggled harder than ever.\n\n\"Cried all the way to the market, Meanie.\" Eenia smiled with his jaundiced teeth. \"Pig that she was. For a fat cunt, she was smaller than I thought...\"\n\nThe tiger whimpered softly as it inched its majestic head towards Moe. The young teenager whimpered back, hesitantly reaching out but only feeling its soft fur once it reached back. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nMiny shushed his little brother.\n\n\"Wot was that--Miny?\"\n\nMoe continued petting the tiger's purring head. The rumble from the tiger felt like irresistible energy in his veins. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nEenie exchanged glances with his next youngest brother. \"For wot?\"\n\n\"This.\" Moe yanked the dart out and stabbed it into Eenie's neck, but didn't stop there. His arm pulled up as hard as it could to reach his ear. It didn't work. Eenie slammed his meaty fist into Moe's face.\n\nMeanie tried grabbing his little brother's arm but was stopped...by Miny. \n\n\"The foo-\"\n\nThe ring of an iron bar sang throughout the air. And then again. And again. And again until there was one less breath in the room. Miny then turned his attention to his remaining brothers...or more specifically his oldest brother Eenie. \"You let my brother go!\"\n\nEenie struggled against Miny's thick arm on his throat. The oldest and cruelest rasped, \"I...am...your...\"\n\nA sudden crack. \"No, you're not.\"\n\nThe two last men of their line laid on the floor, surrounded by the still warm corpses of what was left of their kin. They breathed in heavy unison as the weary tiger did.\n\nThe two stood up, soaked in blood and sweat. The elderly cat did as well.\n\n\"Looks like we all got our toes back.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420683933", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I accidentally @'ed someone else, which is how you and I got in a conversation. \n\nYou proceeded to make a pastebin of this \"harassment\", conveniently only being able to screenshot my tweets and not all of yours responding to me.

Take a chill pill. Also remember those two different times you accused me of misgendering you, and tried to start a massive witchhunt against me, calling me a giant shitlord? Only to realise it was **blatantly** fucking obviously I had never done so? Oh right.\n\nRegarding the pronouns- for all I know, the person who sent that tweet about you (not at you, I should mention), may have known you from TF- where everyone was under the impression you did not have pronoun preferences, and were fine with he/him pronouns (which is what you had told them). Regardless, I could have mentioned something, and I actually did mention it to them elsewhere, iirc.\n\nThe rest of your shit is just as absurd and baseless, and I need to go iron some shirts now, so cheers.\n\nEdit: also, calling anita sarkeesian a \"swerf\" is the most fucking ridiculous \"concern troll\" bullshit I think I've ever heard [rest of this sentence edited per mod advice, those damned fascists].\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420692713", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Heard the thickest scouse accents on the bus to the stadium (could barely understand anything except \"fookin\" which was pretty much every other word...) but it was all good.  Stayed overnight at a guest house, and took the train back to London the next day.  Anyway, thanks for the advice on getting tickets - it really helped.

{"body": "You suddenly wake up to find yourself in a kitchen of superior quality. Gordon Ramsey is sitting afar, but watching with eagle eyes that could pierce through steal. You look up from your empty skillet to find a kitchen full of contestants, hurriedly attempting to throw together their masterpiece to please the master chef. You spot the timer sitting on the wall with only two minutes left. *Quality over quantity?* I think to myself. I quickly throw open a cupboard and my only question has been answered. Perched upon the edge of the shelf sits a glowing box of frosted flakes. You read the brand name. *Piggly Wiggly Frosted Flakes? What the hell is Piggly Wiggly?* You look at the clock and see one minutes and twenty-eight seconds left. You quickly shut your thoughts out and focus on the task at hand. You grab ten bowls and fill them with the frosted flakes and pour milk into each bowl. With ten seconds left you hurriedly throw spoons in each bowl, only getting six spoons in the eight bowls before the timer stops. As soon as you take a step back you realize you forgot to cook the fish you forgot you even put in the bowls in the first place. Gordon stands up and slowly walks over to your presentation. He takes a spoonful of fish and plops it in his mouth. Disgust fills his face and he spits it out. Using a spoon and a fork, he slowly cuts open the fish to reveal the completely raw insides. He looks up at you with angry eyes, slowly raises one hand, and you get on your knees and beg him to reconsider. Without a pause, Gordon lowers his hand at lightning speed and yells at the top of his lungs \"IT'S RAAAAAAAAAW\" as he slams his palm into the fish. Fish goes flying in every direction, but he's not finished yet. He moves onto each bowl smacking fish around and you stay on your knees and lie to him \"I-it was su-su-suposed to be sa-sa-sashimi.\" Tears start streaming down your face as Gordon takes out a raw fish from his sleeve, cuts it into sashimi in half a second, and looks you dead in the eyes. \"THIS IS HOW SASHIMI IS FOCKIN' DONE MATE, YOU WOT? DO YOU EVEN OWN A FIVE STAR RESTAURANT YOU FOCKIN SAP?\" You lie down on the ground bawling your eyes out as Gordon stands on the counter, stomping fish guts into your face.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420827550", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

They are such individuals, and very strongly written. \n\nI have said it before,  and I'll keep on saying it this game has really solidified my hope for the franchise.  It was a good game series with a decently epic hook previously, but the level of immersion the writers were able to create is wonderful, and I am the typical, jaded video game nerd - it's very hard for a game to pique my interest for any amount of time. (Just need way fewer side fetch quests next time around, too much fluff/filler, the actual mission quests and some of the more meaningful and story driven side quests are much more satisfactory. )\n\nBut, I digress, Mass Effect is a great series as well for mostly different reasons than Dragon Age (however, Mako makes my genitals itch, they get better after the first, swear on me mum, m8).

{"body": "Everything we believed up until now had been wrong. War wasn't a dick measuring contest over who had the bigger guns. It's a battle of wits now, which is proven by whatever the fuck just happened yesterday.\n\n**24 HOURS PRIOR**\n\n\"Hey, who is that guy? Is he walking up there unarmed?\"\n\n\"Must be Helen Keller's son, cuz he can't see or hear that there's a fuckin' war going on!\"\n\nAn artillery shell dropped near the squad's position, forcing them into cover. \"Shit!\" I exclaimed. \"Status report!\" \"I'm good!\" \"Fuck, my leg!\" There wasn't a third response. One of my men was injured and another one dead. I was going to go retrieve that guy, but now I can't mobilize enough men to ensure safety. I looked over the mound to see that the guy had reached the president's estate. What the fuck was he doing?\n\nOnce he reached 200 feet range, snipers were trained on him. He dropped everything he had on him to show them he wasn't armed and had no intentions to do anything stupid, besides walking up to Putin's fucking home. \"I want to speak with the president!\" he yelled. The snipers laughed and exchanged something in Russian. \"Are you stupid? We're not just going to have him walk out here in broad daylight. How many snipers you got trained on this building?\" one asked. \"None. The only opposition here is that squad of 4, which is now about 2, and they won't be trying anything. They're kind of low on men.\" he stated. Cheeky cunt. \"I've already proven I'm not armed, so let's get him out here.\" \n\nThe snipers conversed some more, and then one spoke through his radio. A few seconds later, Putin came over the building's intercom and said, \"I'm not stupid enough to come out there. State what you want, and I'll decide if you live.\" The man then spoke a phrase that would echo throughout the world for centuries to come. \"Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, your mother is such a slut, she started a social revolution that allowed everyone to have a share of that ass!\" The intercom made a thumping noise, as if the radio had been dropped. Then, we heard footsteps, a box opening, and a gunshot, in that order. The snipers rushed inside to see what had happened. Half a minute later, they came out. Their faces were sullen and defeated. The lead one declared, \"The President is dead. The burn was simply too sick, so he ended the pain. Expect a treaty meeting soon.\" They walked back inside. The man in front of the building turned around and walked away, whistling \"God Bless America\" while we stared at him in pure awe. After he was gone, I looked back at the one man that was still in good condition. \"What in God's holy fucking name just happened?\" He said, \"I'm not sure, but I caught it all on camera.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420925122", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Nerd Haus is where we play League of Legends (alternating between being the most amazing game in the world and OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS STUPID I'M UNINSTALLING). We make fun of each other and occasionally do giveaways and viewer games. We get salty af and yell obscenities. We feed our friends pentakills. We are 2Lanez and saxopedo, a married couple who never fights outside of League. We play normals rather than ranked; we play to have fun and to illustrate the fact that you don't have to be Diamond to have a good time. Along with our Stream Team, we spend our evenings on the Fields of Justice. \n\n2Lanez: \nHe mains jungle with Trundle, Udyr, and Shaco. He loves the split push tactic and taking towers while the enemy team is chasing his ADC. He used to main ADC but playing with his wife has lowered his tolerance for laning with another human being. He enjoys making stupid puns. No, like seriously stupid puns that you know you shouldn't laugh at, but you can't help it. And he thinks he's Trick2G. \n\nSaxopedo: \nShe mains support with Leona, and occasionally Morgana or Janna or Thresh or...basically any support. But Leona's her girl. She loves to start fights and get in peoples' faces. Please, please don't ask her to ADC. Sometimes, if she REALLY HAS TO, she'll go top or mid. She enjoys long walks on the beach and talking smack to everyone, regardless of team alignment. \n“U WOT M8? Fite me irl I fockin dare ya.” \n\n2Lanez is the main host of the stream. Yes, he's pretty. No, you can't have his number. On Fridays, saxo takes over for the BOT SPOTLIGHT (which means you get to see how mean she really is to her ADC). \n\nYou can find us at http://www.twitch.tv/nerdhaus, Mondays through Saturdays, usually starting at 6:30 PM MST. TONIGHT we start at 7 PM. You can also check us out at www.youtube.com/nerdhausNA\n\nWe hope you'll stop by for an evening!

{"body": "I read these.\n\n&gt;Quellian's comments:\n\n&gt;The problem is, who is Anita to say that the use of tropes is bad? She is a nobody with a second rate education in Women's studies, and all of this is LITERALLY just her opinion. Well, opinions are fine, and she is welcome to have one. But she is not a psychologist, nor a statistician, nor does she have the extensive amount of original, peer reviewed, statistically sound research that would allow her to point at an entire part of our society and say that it's bad. What I want to see is scientific research that proves that the use of these tropes is somehow detrimental to either women or the gaming community itself.\n\n&gt;And really, does this not accurately describe a large part of the SJW movement itself? People, who may have the greatest of intentions, are either using opinions gathered from anecdotal evidence, or do not understand scientific method and therefore rely on bad statistics and poor research to come up with rules for appropriate social conduct by which others are expected to abide. GamerGate, so far, has been the only group strong enough to call SJWs out on their crap, and we're not going anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;apinkgayelephant's comments:\n\n&gt;Ok Ok Ok, Ill walk you through this easily so you can lose your delusions of grandeur.\n\n&gt;Everyone understands this is Anita Sarkeesian's opinion. Nobody reasonable is missing that context. She is making friends in the industry because people agree with her opinions. The idea that media influences the audience is not new, it's the founding principle of propaganda.\n\n&gt;There is no SJW movement. You're running into a bunch of progressives talking on the internet. Any influence on the powers that be are because they agree with people on how to go about social issues. There are extremists and assholes who use social justice as a cover, but they're few and far between. There's a reason the SJW = skeleton jokes get made. Because you're attacking something tied to a stick that sits in the middle of a corn field.\n\n&gt;And last but not least, GamerGate has barely any power. GamerGate is fucking weak sauce. You're like 5,000 whiny chucklefucks at best. There's no real power there. You got websites to repost and fix up their ethics policies that still have nothing to do with the initial outrage. woop. dee. doo. If GamerGate were a literal sauce, it'd be a water bottle of pond water dumped on dry pasta. That's how weak of a sauce GG is.\n\nSo Quellian, while I agree with your ideas, you can't comport yourself in hostile territory  \"call SJWs out on their crap\" striking first and not expect backlash as you got.  There was a lot of \"hey wot m8 fite me\" in your initial post it seems to me.  \n\nI would recommend not using the SJW label at all in there.  Personally I refer to social justice as a cult very often because I see the core philosophies as cultish when they run into racism enabling genetic fallacies like patriarchy and privilege, much like the Bible is full of fallacy I feel this promotes a cult or religious like movement.\n\nSo where I might use a statement like SJWs here with proGG, in neutral territory I might say something like \"the social justice cult\" or \"those who practice the social justice cult teachings.\"  There are ways to word things to get your point across without indiscriminately slapping everyone with a label is my point and without the passive aggressiveness.  While pinkgayelephant let himself be aggravated over a minor label unduly and hit you back twice as hard, you did Ad Hom first basically with a large side of passive aggressiveness.\n\nI'm finding in favor of the anti-gamer mod here.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420958653", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I just heard through the grapevine that somewhere out there on the spooky Internet is already something similar on /r/tattoos top posts.. Such conspiracy? Maybe? Maybe not? does it go deeper? &gt;:] keep tuned folks. FYI 'No rats allowed'\n\nEdit 4 - after what felt like years of extensive research resulting in getting mugged and stabbed by a gang of horny midgets / losing my identity / having my Ferrari stolen (plez not the Ferrari plezzzzz ;''( / my girlfriend getting super mad cause I dropped her guinea pig thing again or something, 10% of half the time it just acts all smug and shit running for hours/days at a time boasting all about his \"GAINS\" &amp;amp;amp;amp; \"STAMINATE\" pfffft. fucking gains! Fucking stamina! Fuck you guinea RAT! and that's the point at which the insignificant bastard makes me angry so I 'drop it' ;) and it's like really worthy of a giggle. Will upload video one day wait till you see this cheeky cunts face I swear.. and also got some real gnarly Doritio™ cravings that would of resulted in death if not cared to, moms the best &amp;amp;amp;lt;3 love mom (nacho cheese flavor though of course) thanks mom &amp;amp;amp;lt;3 anyway after all that - I have made it back to my typewriter and once again sent off my edit for this post with my pet ferret, ETA on reddit is very quick (3-4 weeks from Australia) I laced his cat food with some meth to speed up the slow ferret rat thing.\n\nEdit 5 - ferret rat came back in a shoebox?? contents included:\n1 x dead, very anorexic and scared looking ferret rat!! OH MAN, he was actually cool, we smoked together :( what a shitty year so far.\n1 x analogue watch, Gold in color Doesn't seem to function / work probably filthy rat in disguise and the time was at stopped on 12.14 ? Hm. Quickly traded that haunted rat in at cash converters for another ferret rat!! Yay 2015 okay year so far! \nAnd 1 x sticky note that reads LE REDDIT xD DID THIS. I. I . No. There's no way, the LE REDDIT ARMY! what the fuck guys, opinions? I'm so suicidal right now I'm not gonna sleep this is unbelievable. GAHH NOOOOT THE LEE REDDDIT ARMY!\n\nEdit 6 - SOMETHING IS GOING ON AND ITS FISHY AS\n\nEdit 7 -  WHOLLY CANOLLI  |  &gt;.&gt; | o.o the paranoia is kicking in, hearts beating slight to fast to be able to enjoy my mountain Jew (mom got it with the Doritos™ ages ago just for me, she knows me so well - you know fairy godmother outta Cinderella? That's actually my mom but all my wishes are just Doritos™ and Mountain Dew (nacho cheese only please) otherwise she gets in trouble. Bad trouble, but she learned. anyway just took 7 Panadol to help with the sadness and how spooky the year already is... AGHH you got me, I haven't been 100% truthful to you reddit, I know that note specifically had your name on it but. I just can't buy it, the box itself was for crocs and I know for fucking sure reddit don't wear no stupid ugly rat crocs.. Still creepy but I think maybe ~whispers 4chan did it. I think I'm gonna be assassinated for all the evil sins I've done and they figured me out!... That's enough for this edit I need to cry out some dew and drink it again to maintain my brain strength or it won't be long before they find me with their not as strong brain strength. Over and out\n\nEdit 8 - actually using this edit to edit like a normal editor would edit. my Mexican dad / not Albanian trandad told me to write that? don't know why, he just hasn't been part of anything even a little a fun very recently (like last 400 years) and actually his such a prick he made sure my last 18 years of life were so bad I was practically a slave, maybe his a rat! FUCKING RATS!! Oh darn it I'm tearing blood from my eyes again.\n\nEdit 9 - reel edits this time cos it's getting hard to read, can u believe I don't have a job, all the rats took them is what my dads say.

Just as if you took an item in a store to the counter and realized it was defective you would not pay, you can do the same which a restaurant where they have failed to meet their end of the contract i.e. edible food as described on the menu. All that being said you do get cheeky cunts who eat the meal without complaint, did not send the items back, and then try to not pay at the end on purpose for no reason this is a crime in nearly every jurisdiction. \n\nIn relation to the not allowed to not tip, quite frankly take your head out of your ass if you are a server. A tip is supposed to be for good service, I'll accept in the US it is now for adequate service as well.

{"body": "Gonna disagree with someaussieguy. Learning to cope with this sort of feeling *without* cauterizing the wound and burning all relevant bridges is a useful skill, and a big part of becoming a better person.\n\nI had a crush on a girl throughout my two years at sixth form college (that's ages 16 to 18, for anyone not in the UK), because she was pretty and very nice without being sickly sweet or boring because of it. Lots of energy and passion, so I kind of fixated on her and started imagining she was somebody she wasn't. She certainly knew I was crushing on her, but apparently after the first year or so she thought I'd got over it and moved on because I started behaving like a normal human being instead of a love-sick teenager. \n\nEnded up asking her after two fookin years of crushing and she was shocked that I still felt that way. Hurt like hell when she turned me down, so I struggled with that for a few weeks. Coped with it and moved on, fortunately, and I'm glad I discovered I can do that; it makes your thinking about relationships in general much clearer, knowing that it'll hurt for some time, but you'll recover.\n\nHow to manage that... I don't know what I did. I guess I spent a lot of time in those couple of weeks getting very, very upset, but kept on truckin'. Don't try and push the feeling away, because that's just lying about it and bottling it up, which isn't healthy. Confront it, confront what you think she's like and then look at the evidence of what she's *actually* like. Hopefully you'll spot the differences between reality and your idealised form, and that'll help.\n\nBest of luck, anyway.

Dante is at bare minimum faster than lightning in DMC1 and much faster later, is nigh-unkillable thanks to the regen, has more versatility in his weapons and styles, and has curbstomped a planetary level threat. Zoro has the advantage of haki, which will be big. He has more strength feats, but Dante's only real strength feat is blocking a punch from a demon the size of Oars while in human form, which I believe is in Zoro's ballpark.\n\nI think in round 1, Zoro's haki might give him the advantage if he can manage to get around dante's many kinds of gun. The problem is that if Zoro stabs dante, dante will laugh in his face and stab him back.

He has tanked meteors in Majinn form, and on top of the general increase in physical stats he can now fly. His dreadnought form makes him nigh-invulnerable (there's a no-limits fallacy here, but DMC4's final boss's ultimate energy attack can just be stood inside of while in dreadnought with no damage whatsoever, so it's pretty significant). Generally speaking in DMC, his 'basic' devil trigger will bitchslap anyone who manages to get the upper hand on regular Dante, so I'm inclined to think that this would let him beat Zoro without much trouble.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421194831", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're entitled to your opinion, but I'd encourage you to read the article without bias. I honestly think you're coming to conclusions that the author hasn't pointed to.\n\nThe first point he makes is that the templating syntax is familiar to people who have worked with something like ASP or JSP and goes on to mention weather.com moved to Angular largely because their back end java developers were able to easily transition to it. He then includes that the clients he's worked with have switched to angular for the same reasons. He's not claiming this as a problem, but this does later tie into the larger problem he's pointing out with the article.\n\nHe then goes on to explain that because of the syntax the only way angular can parse its `{{}}` statements is by parsing the entire DOM (including text nodes and attribute values). He then goes on to say that this alone isn't a deal breaker performance wise, however that decisions like this echo throughout angulars design decisions and goes on to link to a few other articles demonstrating these additional performance issues. (after all why he would do the same research someone else has and give them no credit? it would detract from his point, I really don't think this is circlejerking)\n\nSo, at this point we have a framework that appeals to devs because of it's similarity to languages they use in the back end, but this similarity is causing big performance issues. Now he goes on to explain why Angular hasn't caught on as well as he imagined it would with front end devs (angular best practice vs javascript best practice, the previously mentioned performance issues that back end devs don't notice). This causes a problem trying to hire front end angular devs.\n\n\nSo to recap,\n\n * Provides anecdotal evidence that the big switch factor for angular is similarity to back end languages and supported by big name Google\n * Suggests performance is poor, provides other articles to back up claim\n * It's hard to find front end devs wanting to work with angular (anecdotal, only one piece of \"evidence\" supporting this)\n\nThis problems lead into Google announcing 2.0 to resolve performance issues, which is inherently getting rid of the familiarity for back end devs which is according to the above a large reason for switching to Angular.\n\nHe then leads into the thought that this will kill Angular off; 2.x will require a rewrite (equal in burden to switch to a new framework entirely) but this time 2.x will not have the same level of familiarity for back end devs, which is where angular succeeds in enterprise IT. Additionally, enterprise IT management went with Angular to avoid these sweeping framework changes; they don't want to rewrite already working pages.\n\nSo going point by point with you\n\n&gt; The few factual points (performance) are hidden in a circlejerkesque quotefest.\n\nWhy write about what's already been published, which was the complaint in your first post? He's merely providing evidence from others of Angular performance issues.\n\n&gt; The rest of it is mumbojumbo about frontenders and corporate IT without at any point clarifying or even atempting to characterize what these categories mean,\n\nThe article is directed towards people in IT, so I would assume anyone this article is targeted for understands the difference between a front end dev and a back end dev and I'd also assume they know what enterprise means. This is merely setting the stage for why people go to angular (back end devs are familiar with it and it's backed by a big stable company so there shouldn't be big sweeping rewrites that cost time and money).\n\n&gt; or offering any factual evidence that the corporate IT influence on Angular is even the root of the performance problems.\n\nThis isn't ever suggested, to quote the article \"in addition to appealing to their managers, Angular appeals to Java developers. ... In itself this is not a problem: people should just use whatever framework ties in with their coding style.\" He's simply setting the stage.\n\n&gt; Finally, the article offers no solution or alternative\n\nThat's not the point; he's simply stating the big overarching problem with Angular he sees and the catch 22 it finds itself in.\n\n&gt; dishing out a subliminal jab at the aforementioned unspecified corporate IT users \"Either Angular 2.0 will still suck or it will become awesome and corporate IT users will not understand it\"\n\nI honestly think you're taking this personally -- surely you can agree that the 2.0 rewrite is a radical change from what there is now and will cost a similar amount of man hours as switching to an entirely new framework. He's simply suggesting that the rewrite is likely going to be aimed more towards front end devs (which goes against a large portion of why Angular has been chosen) and by Angular simply doing a rewrite and inevitably stopping support of 1.x makes enterprise IT managers go back on why they chose it as well. It's not saying back end devs can't understand these changes, but if it's going to require just as much work to switch to an entirely new framework what's the incentive for them to go with Angular 2.x?\n\n&gt; So in summary, the author doesn't like structured frameworks, because he is too frontendy for them.\n\nu wot m8", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421255620", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Totally unnecessary change. Brotherhood selling out Gendry was just a cheap twist to get Mel more boob time.\n\nI think they did a fantastic job with season 1.

{"body": "&gt; For example I get told that Ohayoo (おはよお) is really Ohayou (おはよう), same with Arigatoo(ありがとお) (ありがとう).\n\nWell first, I would suggest using what the Kana says in the book, not the romaji. The Romaji that Genki uses is what is called Kunrei-Shiki, and basically it shows you phonetically how it is pronounced, rather than in a direction 1-to-1 corrospondence of the Kana, where おう makes a lengthened \"oo\" sound rather than dipthonging \"ou\". However, the book definitely also writes おはよう and ありがとう as such. The romaji disappears after chapter 2 anyway, so I wouldn't worry about that too much.\n\nはじめまして is more or less a set expression that means something along the lines of \"nice to meet you\". I don't see where the book really differs in this regard.\n\nAs far as わたし, it's not that it is an inherently feminine word, but that it is the polite \"I\" and women tradiotionally have been expected to speak more formally. So really saying you'd sound femine if you said わたし is a bit much, it is more that ぼく sounds a bit less polite / mascule. \n\nAlso, just keep in mind that Niconico is going to be less polite and have more slang (just in general), which may sometimes be at odds with what you are learning.

{"body": "I agree with DM's not allowing the vigor item- we generally play 3.5 in a fashion where we want to do less bookkeeping, and those items are a perfect fit for not bookkeeping hitpoints after a certain time post-combat, if an hour passes you're full. If we had normal speed sessions, they'd be out.\n\nHealing comes in 2 kinds: in-combat burst, and out-combat \"back to full\" hp. The first has to be as big as possible for as few action as possible, the second has to cost as few per hp as possible, while healing most of the hitpoints that will be lost.\n\n3 times 2d8 per day is better as any other kind of healing not on a continous item, and they're cheap, and more importantly, don't run out like a wand. This means that for out of combat healing they are great.\n \nSecondly, in-combat healing. No-one needs in-combat healing in 95% of cases unless they would fall over. Enter the healing belt. 4d8 is better healing then anything you can get for 750 gp, burst wise. It also doesn't cost any action on your side, so being the most effective action-wise there is: you GAIN actions. Or better yet, your codzilla gains another standard action, with which he can flame strike/entangle/whatever makes enemies cry. Preventing enemies from attacking is better in combat then trying to fix stuff afterward.\n\nThe belts are also a LOT cheaper then the 1000 gp and 5th lvl spell slot for revivify, or the 5000 gp for actual raise dead, where he also loses a level. Again,the anti-downed effect doesn't even require an action to use, let alone raise dead's ridiculous cast time.\n\n Over the long run, every one of our party members has gotten a healing belt ever since we got one at random, they sustain you so well we had several campaigns without healers- just some break enchantment/ remove disease/poison support.\n\nyou wot? str and con boosts are some of the worst items to put in valuable item slots.\n You can pump your AC if that's your game, or get great utility items, or get items that add new functions to things you already have, or better bonusses to the areas you want them to be in, instead of low bonusses that apply to a few things. \n\nBut healing you can stick a lot of belts on each other for cheap (1,5*750 per extra belt), giving you great out of combat healing and  death prevention for an unmatched price.\n 2d8 3/day and 4d8 burst on downed doesnt sound so good on higher levels, but what about 7 belts stapled, 2d8 21/day? and a burst heal of 28d8 when you would die WILL full heal you. All this for about 7k market price, a whole 1000 gp cheaper as a +2 weapon! And  they even increased the base crafting cost for them if you craft them, so you only save 250 gp per belt, showing that even the designers realized it was strong.\n\nI mean, it's not the answer to everything, but it's cheap and strong.\n\nHealers are not really a thing that's needed, just a few \"no sir stop that\" spells, some consistent healing, both of which can be bought with cash. That leaves an entire character open to do something more useful then healing, and feats and character levels are worth a LOT more then some gold. \nOf course, if someone makes a healer because they want to play one, sure. Saves the party some cash. But i would expect them to do quite a few things that are not healing.\n\nTL;DR heal belt efficient as fuck for healing, money is cheaper then feats and character levels. Proactive reduction of enemy actions is also better then healing, but sometimes you gotta heal- but spend money on that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421423029", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Not good not bad.\n\n&gt; escape being his damage is actually downside it's not like you know every champ has the same idea behind them? (fizz lissandra) \n\nFizz if he maxes his E (which he should do) has a 8 second CD on it which is extremely low given how good of a escape it is.  Fizz also has extremely frustrating trading potential with his q+w then e out combo at level 3.  \n\nFor Liss she mainly uses her E as a finishing move when she goes in to ult.  For the most part Liss sits back and pokes you down before going all in which means her e is going to be up most of the time which means the window in which she doesn't have a escape is way smaller then Zed's.\n\nZed usually maxes his escape last (which means the CD on it is going to be way longer), relies on his escape for trading unlike Liss and to a lesser extent Fizz and also his CD is longer especially given that Fizz's E and Liss's E both have bigger ranges.\n\n&gt;those come quick to mind and I should not have to build a specific item just to not die every 80 seconds to one champion on their team\n\nZhonya's hourglass is item you build second on most AP's anyway and is a very strong item.  It isn't like you're building a shit item that's only designed to counter Zed.  Not only that but one of it's components (Seeker's Armguard) is very very strong lane items against Zed and you should build it in lane against Zed.\n\nI see nothing wrong with that.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421444622", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We are 2Lanez and saxopedo, a married couple who never fights outside of League.

{"body": "**Alone in the Dark**\n\nIt all happened after sunset. A lone rider arrived at the gates, with an arrow sticking from his thigh. According to the him, a group of reavers had descended to his village, burning everything that crossed his path. The sentinels confirmed his story shortly after, spotting fire after fire on the eastern border of their lands. Every new fire seemed to be closer to Harvest Hall. *They're coming for us*, understood Tristan, and started thinking of a way to save his family from the crushing defeat they were about to suffer.\n\nKnowing that they would not have any chance to fight, Tristan decided he'd at least save his family. He had his siblings and his mother brought in front of him and explained their plan to them.\n\n\"Matthos, Steffon\", he said. \"Take the fastest horses you can find and ride west until you reach our uncle's host. We need them back as soon as possible\" Matthos and Steffon ran away, and Tristan turned his attention to his sisters and his mother. \"Argella, Sarella, mother\", he said. \"Dress yourselves with the dirtiest rags you can find and lock yourselves inside the jail cells. You'll be safe there.\"\n\n\"What about you?\", asked his mother. \"I'm not going anywhere until you promise me you'll be safe.\"\n\n*\"Don't worry, mother. I have a plan\", said Tristan, looking into his mother's eyes. \"Trust me.\"\n\nDespite having absolutely no clue about his next movment, Cassandra seemed to trust his son. After embracing him she rushed back into the cells. Hoping he'd find enough men to resist until his uncle came back, Tristan headed to the barracks, where the few soldiers that had not gone with his uncle at Nightsong were distributing weapons and armor to anyone that was able to lend a hand. *Kids, old men, women and cripples, most of them armed with pitchforks and scythes*, thought Tristan. *We're going to get slaughtered if we fight.* Nevertheless, he had to try. \n\nHe climbed the wall with the archers, and saw a bunch of torches approaching the walls. *They're not that much*, he thought to himself. *If we can hold them outside until Borrous returns we should be safe*. In an attempt to scare them away, he grabbed a longbow, lit a fire arrow and shot it towards the torches, falling short. As a response, someone from what appeared to be the middle of the formation shot a fire arrow, which soared in the sky and hit one of the banners on top of the wall, lighting it on fire. *Seven hells,* thought Tristan. *There's no way we win against that.* Hoping that his wits would save him where his strength could not, Tristan started shouting at the darkness until he got a response.\n\n\"Who are you and what do you want?\"\n\n\"Your Lord's fookin' skull!\", shouted a voice. \"Give it to us or we'll take it by force after burning this place to the ground with all of you inside!\"\n\n*Liars*, thought Tristan. *Even if I got killed and someone threw my head down the walls, you'd claim it's not the right head in order to rape and pillage more.* He turned to watch his meager army, and by the looks on their faces they seemed to think the same he did. *But I'm not going to let them burn my house.* Tristan fell silent, trying to think a good plan, until he saw a fire on the west for the second time that day. *The beacon again? what the fuck?*\n\n----\n\n[Meta] Part 3 (Steffon &amp; Matthos' wild ride + end of the story) coming tomorrow.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421521864", "subreddit": "woiafpowers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I guess the next important thing for German history is over a hundred years after Otto. Otto's dynasty died out so now the Salians were on the throne. And in 1075 the Emperor was Henry IV. Now, at that time it was the feudal age which meant the Emperor had vassals administering the lands. And some of those vassals were bishops, archbishops and other members of the clergy. Now, they are bound by their vows so they don't have children (or at least shouldn't, the Borgia proved a few centuries later you still can). So every time a bishop died they needed to replace him. Who? Well, that's precisely the problem.\n\nThe Emperor thought they were his vassals so it'd be in his power to appoint them. The Pope thought they're part of the Church and he fucking controls the Church. So the Pope sent Henry a letter saying he could no longer appoint bishops (known as investiture) and since he was the Pope only he had the authority to give somebody the Imperial Crown but more importantly, take it away from him. Henry got that letter and basically replied with \"Go fuck yourself, fucking fuckface\", calling the Pope by his birthname \"Hildebrand\" instead of Gregory. And then this controversy finally came into action when the bishop of Milan died and both Henry and Gregory appointed a different successor simultaneously.\n\nPope Gregory surely didn't like that and did all he had in his power to discredit Henry, excommunicating him (big fuckind deal at that time!), saying he is no longer legitimate King (much less so Emperor) and...finally...*finally* it's happening! FINALLY! He addressed the letter not to Imperator Augustus, not to Rex Romanorum, not to any title the Kings had at that time. No, he addressed it to the \"Rex Teutonicum\" to discredit him as a foreigner, as \"something different\" after germanic tribes the Romans encountered a thousand years earlier. And since he wrote in Latin, because Pope, one might argue that \"Teutonicum\" translates to \"German\" as in modern day Italian \"tedesco\". So finally, we have evidence of somebody being called German...as an insult. But still, German.\n\nBut back to our German King Henry. He already had trouble with rebellions and now the fucking Pope called him a fucking phoney. Which just gives the nobility a reason to rebel against him. So Henry has to back down, otherwise he'd lose his fucking Empire over this. But how? The Pope knows the power he has, if he just ignores Henry he can get rid of him and get another, more pope-friendly and less powerful (therefore needing the approval of the Pope to keep his realm stable) king. Which sounds way better than forgiving Henry. So, how does Henry save his reign? He walks to Canossa, a city in northern Italy where the Pope currently resides, and is dressed in only a simple shirt, like a beggar. And it was winter so it was cold and snowy. And Henry didn't even wear shoes. So apparently he sat outside of the Pope's residence for two days, begging him to absolve his sins. And now the Pope is in trouble.\n\nBecause, he's the fucking Pope. Which means when somebody asks for their sins to be absolved, especially when he shows his willingness to change by being dressed like a beggar and fasting, even though he's a fucking King, he has to do that or fail his duty as a Pope. So Gregory has to back down, let Henry in, share communion with him (must have been the most awkward communion ever) and make sure he neither freezes nor starves to death. So now Henry is no longer excommunicated, can be king again and solve his trouble with the Pope, right? Well, nope. While he was down in Italy freezing his ass off to keep his kingship his dukes rebelled against him and set up a claimant to his throne. Shit. Just froze your testicles off for nothing, not good. So on a horse and back to Germany, fighting rebellions! Fucking Pope.\n\nBut now Henry was a member of the Church again and the Pope acknowledged him as King again. So the rebellion runs into trouble and has to retreat into Saxony, the only part of the Empire they have control over. So this rebellion should be done shortly, right? Well, no. Pope Gregory strikes again, saying the claimant against Henry should actually be the rightful King. Which probably lead to Henry saying something to the extent of \"You wot m8?\" and every clergyman who thought this was an issue about theology with the investiture instead of personal hatred had a similar reaction. So suddenly Gregory maneuvered himself in a corner, congratulations for being stupid. But regardless of Gregory the rebels were strong enough to face Henry in battle and...won. They won a fucking battle against the fucking Emperor. But...whoops, the claimant to the throne lost his hand and got wounded. And died the day after the battle. Shit. Now we have a rebellion without a claimant, this sucks. Let's pack our backs, we're going...ah nope, found another guy who wants to be King and the Pope likes him, perfect!\n\nBut that second rebellion was fairly small and the new Duke of Swabia (the claimant in the first rebellion was Duke of Swabia, got stripped of his title and Henry appointed this new one) fought it successfully because Henry had a more important problem. Gregory just supported another claimant to his throne for the second time. And that's not great. So...what do you do if you don't like the Pope? You make your own Pope! And now that you've got your own Pope that dude in Rome isn't a Pope! So you can march against him and fucking kick his ass! This is soooo easy. So after some complications the Imperial Army conquered Rome, stripped Gregory of his papacy and put their own guy, Clement on the Papacy. But then the Papacy changed again to some anti-Imperial guy, the Empire was in war again, the Papacy changed back to another dude who liked the Emperor...\n\nThis carried on for a few decades and it fucking sucked. Henry was already gone, deposed by his son Henry (fuck this shit, the first Henry was number 4, his son is number 5...) but this shit carried on. So Henry V and the current Pope made an agreement, the Concordat of Worms, which basically decided that the Emperor can not appoint bishops but the clergy elects them theirselves while the Pope allowed imperial envoys to be present at that election (*cough* vote for *cough cough*) and the bishops to be vassals of the Emperor and having to fulfill their duties as vassals like sending troops when needed. But more importantly: The Emperor shall not appoint anti-Popes and the Pope should not appoint anti-Kings.\n\nAnd maybe more importantly: They technically just set up sovereignity. The Church may appoint bishops, yes. But those bishops have to follow the rule of their Emperor, instead of what the Pope tells them.

I had to ask myself what does he know.  IF you were the programmer, you wouldn't be posing such a question to ME unless you'd skipped your schizophrenia medication for the last while.

The opportunity for any elucidation was met with indignant rejection, as if some personal argument had been started, which, again, considering the venue and the average historical behavior of likely participants, is not improbable.

I wish the built-in screenshot (hold power down + power button) took uncompressed screenshots, but for whatever reason it doesn't. The [puush.me ](http://puush.me/) app may be compressing it a little for upload as well. I couldn't say.*\n\n-----\n\n&gt;Isn't much ui there to look at\n\nThat's because that's a screenshot of the text editor in advanced mode (similar to RES \"Big Editor\") or even Reddit's \"Live Preview\" box.

The quick icons at the bottom are very convenient and I'd be shocked if Reddit News didn't have them in a future update (beta for a reason). For the time being, it hasn't bothered me any, but I could see it being a pain to switch to.\n\nAlso note that there a ton of really useful things related to navigation that I can't show simply with screenshots.

{"body": "Hi /u/mamtic and welcome to /r/kundalini.   \n\n&gt;Are these just standard meditation feelings, or is this a sign of kundalini?   \n\nBased on what you wote, this is the activity of Prana, and probably not Kundalini.  \n\n&gt;Sometimes during meditation I begin to feel these tingly sensations through parts of my body. Sometimes the sensations turn into strong pain or pleasure. Sometimes I feel a strange head rush and a feeling of my point of view expanding out my body.  \n\nThese are all very typical and normal experiences. There's nothing worrisome going on here. That includes your chest orgasm experience in your post history.   \n\n&gt;I don't like doing yoga. I don't like doing anything other than concentration on my breathe during meditation. The reason is because my discipline and resolve and awareness is still weak, and the only object I'm somewhat competent and fluent with is my breathe.  \n\nYou speak of addictions (not to substances), of laziness etc. You might find some positive influences within the /r/getdisciplined and related subs.  \n\nConcentration is considered the starting point. The second step is to move the focus point of concentration around and observe. Take note. Notice. Get it?  You may find certain thoughts have a relationship to specific areas of your body, as an example. That can become a language to you, but if you remain in that first step of concentration, you never will cope well with more advanced situations.  \n\n*JUST* doing concentration is often frowned upon my many schools for it's commonly unsmooth evolutionary path. You might want to consider a few other meditative forms like Metta (Lovingkindness) and Insight/Vippasana. Concentration is the foundation skill, though. It is step one. If you cannot concentrate, you'll have a bit of trouble with the Insight. Explore the tremendous  resources for meditation at /r/meditation/wiki/faq , on line at free places like dharmaunderground, the taobums, and many others.   \n\n&gt;My goal is currently just to develop concentration to the point of reaching the jhanas, and it doesn't involve kundalini at all. So I am just ignoring these sensations and returning to my object(breathe). By doing this, would I be stunting my opportunities to awaken kundalini?   \n\nYes and no. You'd be stunting the broad vocabulary of experience that might be useful to an ongoing growth and evolutionary path. You may or may not skirt around Kundalini - there's no certain way to tell.  \n\nReaching ambitously for jhanas with what comes across as a rigid stubborn methodology will almost certainly yield a nasty outcome. Balance is essential. Some of your post history *does* point beyond concentration towards mindfulness. Hmmm. You also speak of an attraction to \"superpowers\" based on an Autobiography of a Yogi. But you combine this with an \"I don't like yoga\", yet those yogas (not just hatha!) were and are ESSENTIAL to inspiring superpowers in a safe wise way.  That's a bit like saying that you want the health benefits of vegetables, but you only eat meat and potatos. Tricky combination. What is the motivation behind this?   \n\nTo reach for superpowers *without* a balanced and wise approach will naturally lead to repeated mistakes that will harm you and possibly others. Are you wiser than that, or are you being a dumbass? Hard to tell within your text. It's like those FAIL videos on YT: \"Hey guys! Watch this.\". There are no Darwin awards for spiritual seekers.  \n\nWith your narrow path approach, if Kundalini did arise (it *could*) you would be *rather* ill-prepared. This is not something to fear. Rather it is something to inspire a more balanced pursuit of Eastern methods. Devotion and dedication have always been a strong aspect of these practices. Devotion should melt through your claimed laziness. If it doesn't, you're missing the mark comehow.  \n\nHope that helps you a bit.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421712124", "subreddit": "kundalini", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll share a couple with you.\n\nSo growing up in the UK in the latter part of the 90's, an 1/8th of weed was between £15 and £20 (about $20-$25). It was 'orange bud' skunk weed - the only type that seemed to be available to me - and was considered an upgrade from the soap-bar or slate hash we used to get which really did seem like compressed dirt. The weed looked like it had been compressed or squashed a bit as the buds were dense, so definitely imported.\n\nThe stone was mellow, not absolutely killer, and you could easily finish an 8th in a day if you had nothing to do. Most importantly it tasted ok, citrus and a bit sweet, which was a huge improvement on the crappy hash that we scored before.\n\nIn the early 2000's, I met a guy who got me literally some of the best trees I've ever had in my life. Huge, sticky open buds with THC crystals visible all over it. In the sunlight it literally glittered. It also stank to high heaven, and the onset of the stone was faster, it lasted longer and was definitely a more incapacitating high and I probably wouldn't be as active, but still could function. Bear in mind that in the UK most weed was imported at that time (at least within the market I was in), so this was novel and exotic. I also got arrested with a full 8th on me, and the police were kind of dazzled by it - at the station everyone crowded around to look at it and smell it, and they were just incredulous - one of the fuckers even asked me if it was even weed. I spent the day in the cells and I'm sure they nipped a bud for themselves the cheeky cunts.\n\nFast forward a few years and my first trip to Amsterdam. Be me, walk into coffeeshop and say \"I want the strongest, the dankest and most peng shit you have please sir, and 3g of it.\" and the guy laughed at me and asked if I was sure. I said \"well of course. If I wanted your bog standard shit, I'd have stayed at home\". By this time I thought I was Mr Weed, I could smoke any shit. Anyway, I make a big doobie and me and my girlfriend happily toot away on it. 5 minutes later we were so stoned we could barely stay awake. I put the same amount in I would normally, and it just kicked our arses. We had bought a porno earlier with the intention of watching it getting frisky (yeah yeah TMI), so put it on thinking it'd inspire us to stay awake. It was 4pm, we laid down... then woke up at 4am wondering what the fuck had happened.\n\nThose are my stories about weed of increasing quality. Nowadays I get some well-cured, nice smelling stuff - but actually wouldn't choose the dynamite shit any more. I like to be able to do stuff. If I wanted to knock myself out I'd take benzos or something!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421748981", "subreddit": "Drugs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "She has dozens of business deals going on for her and keeping the pear market out of ponyville. Fluttershy has a monopoly on cleaning up poop so incase there's a stampede of pigs that mess up ponyvile, we know who to call. Fluttershy gained an ounce of confidence when her friends were near death. All of which had the confidence to embark on a journey, climb a mountain, and actually enter a dragon's lair without freezing up like a retarded goat and pissing themselves. After that moment, she lost that confidence so that's not exactly valuable compared to being confident any other time. Christ I mean Rarity tried to seduce a dragon, RD straight up hit a dragon, and Twilight actually tried to reason with something she wasn't totally sure could be reasoned with. Saying AJ mindlessly flaunts her strength? Holy shit you scrub, that's her job. To be strong. Fluttershy can barely lift two bunnies, let alone struggle under sharing the weight of Twilight. Twilight's skinny as fuck anyway. I could bench press her and still have the endurance to stack things on spike. Not just any unicorn can pick up that many apples mind you. Rarity wasn't doing shit compared to Twilight. She can't even haul a day's worth of diamonds back to her house. She gets some pleb like spike to do that work. We're talking about Celestria's motherfuckin' student here who became a freakin' damn princess. Mudponies are well known for having green thumbs anyway. Look at my bitch Rosebud for example. Best fuckin' roses a cheeky cunt could ask for. Those shits smell like fuckin' sweet pony plot anyway. Gives me a hard on from across the room! Fucking Carrot Top is my god damn idol. Fuckin' carrots are the hallmark of a fuckin' town! This bitch showers ponies with them like dollar bills. Earth ponies clearly have a talent with agriculture so I don't see what you're trying to tell me. Applejack is my mother fuckin' waifu she makes me hype as shit I wish my haunches were tight as hers you know what I'm saying? She has a bomb ass hat that goes with anything. I mean jesus christ she has a killer fashion sense. I'd buy overalls styled by her anyday. Plus she's a bomb ass cook. She fuckin' knows her way 'round a god damn apple. Plus she's so helpful, even when she goes to the mother fuckin' grand galloping galla she volunteers to help out with the god damn hedges. Shutterbye just scares all the fuckin' animals and crashes the damn party. Fuckin' filly has no god damn manners. What kind of pony has a yellow coat anyway? Yellow manes is where it's at. Pink is a fuckin' dumb color with the exception of Pinkie Pie that crazy cunt. I love me some bomb ass cup cakes I mean holy shit life of the party right there.

COME LOOK FOOKIN POLICE!  I'm out now but was a navy police for 10 years and I'm hear to tell you this. No one can deny that there are bad cops in the world but the vast majority are good normal people. You have no idea how scary it is to be in that position. I've never had to use my weapon but I've had to un-holster it twice and your brain is screaming.  At that moment your brain goes \"black\" and you lose a lot of your higher functioning.  It's the reason cops empty whole magazines into shooters. You know if you have to shoot this guy you will be analyzed under a microscope in an investigation and the department will take your weapon and you will be treated like you fucked up even if you didn't.  Better hope you can articulate why you had to really damn well. In both instances where I drew my weapon I did it because I was almost certain I might die right now but if I had to fire it, I probably would have hesitated out of fear and be dead now. Luckily it never came down to that.  If you tell someone with violent crimes in their past SPECIFICALLY SHOOTINGS in a felony stop to show you their hands and you see them going under seats and in glove compartment, there's a damn good chance he's coming out with a gun and you can die that day. I want to see my wife and kids again. This isn't a regular traffic stop this is a felony stop. Very specific orders are given to prevent violent felons from getting the drop on you and shooting you.

The biggest thing to keep in mind is PSP has TONS of double track trail, and most of it is pretty easy to get lost on. \n\nThe majority of the trail is double track, the two trails I highlighted are the single track that you are going to be looking for. The back parking area on the left has a double track trail that will take you right to nearly all of the single track, green, blue, and red. There's a ton of it and it all starts and ends at the same place. \n\nThe other piece of single track is the one off the Algonquian Camp road. It's a gravel road off the paved road and I seriously mean that the entrance to the single track isn't well labeled. I think there is a small blue square on a stick, maybe. This single track loop is huge. It's mostly blue with some intense sections and a few red shoots you can take off of it. \n\nThe flowy single track trail in the back is sort of confusing to get to, it's over the boat ramp bridge and up up up up a bunch of climbing and then you finally reach the 5 fork and there it is. They've only finished one that's a pretty short loop, but if you plan on spending the whole weekend up here you should at least try to check it out. You'll also be able to see some of the progress they're making on the rest of the trails.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask, I spend an enormous amount of time at PSP. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421968031", "subreddit": "RVAbikes", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Still, I knew the Kingdome was a tough joint to win in but I felt good being up 2-0 in the series with the last 3 to play in Seattle.  (Remember the original WC format gave home field \"advantage\" to the home team in the form of a 2-3 format. Pretty weird.). \n\nAnyway, watching game 5 I was in my dorm at Rutgers going insane.  I couldn't watch anymore so I got in my car to listen on the radio because John Sterling and Michael Kaye were my good luck charms since the 94 season when we were looking good for the elusive playoffs before the motherfooking strike happened.  \n\nAnyway, I aimlessly drove my car north on Route 1 in Jersey listening to the game, which went on and on.  I got to around Newark and decided to turn around. So I headed south down Route 1 back past Ol' Rutgers and wound up in Princeton when this happened.

{"body": "&gt;food in LA\n&gt;Cheaper\n\nu wot m8? Food in Korea is ridiculously cheap. I find that food from ones own country abroad tastes very special and unique, to the extent of tasting better. Like, I am from the UK, which is famous for Fish and chips, but the best Fish and Chips I've ever had was in New Zealand. I think the same principle applies here, the ingredients won't be much different, but they will have a Uniqueness to them from being sourced elsewhere. However I don't agree with you saying they \"admit\" to it being better, as that implies that it is definitively better and that Korean natives are just lying, which is simply not true. Korea has a lot of regional dishes scattered across the country, but most Koreans tend to only live in Seoul and don't get to experience it all. I would agree that some could argue LA Korean food is as good as and for some examples better than Seoul's Korean food, but there's an extent. It'd be like me saying that the \"American BBQ\" in the UK was better than in the states, because I went to a state with similar BBQ style to the UK, when in-facts it changes from location to location and through traditional and regional dishes. Food and travelling go hand in hand and I honestly am commited to spending a life-time exploring it as much as possible.

They've \n\n&gt;Stasis is relatively straightforward, touch a piece of ice, and make parts or all of you utterly invincible, but also immovable. Whatever you stasis gets a silvery, icy sheen. You choose how long the stasis will last, when you activate it, so with a big chunk of ice, you could stasis yourself for years. You can’t affect clothing or anything you’re holding, limiting turning thin string into an impossibly sharp blade. \n\n\"Parts of yourself\" mean you can still create impossibly sharp blades. Stasis a single cell thick layer of your epidermis, or a single hair if dead parts of your body are allowed, and you still get an impossibly sharp blade. You could create thousands of 30μm-thin needles by Stasising alternating rows of skin cells.\n\nAs a more macabre option, dying people could turn their bodies into 3D printers, Stasising sections of body parts with arbitrary shapes. Morbid obesity would help with the size limits, and of course the head can be preserved so it's not a costly sacrifice in a Utilitarian sense.\n\n&gt;If you stasis all of yourself, you will become immovable by anything, even gravity, but you won’t be able to see what’s happening.\n\n\"Immovable by gravity\": unconstrained by the clutches of the sun, earth, galaxy, or supercluster components, you immediately fly off into space at thousands of kilometers per second.\n\nThis needs clarification.\n\n&gt;so for many generation, when someone is about to die, they instead are taken to the wall, and stasis themselves for ten thousand years or so,\n\nThis is going to be awkward in ten thousand years when the first octogenarians thaw and are immediately crushed to death by later generations.\n\n&gt;making it incapable of changing temperature\n\nYou wot m8. This is either superconductivity, a perfect insulator, or a cheap source of energy. If it perfectly reflects all heat at the point where it receives it, use it as perfect insulation: furnaces, clothes, etc. If it perfectly reflects all heat it receives, evenly distributed over its surface, coat a thin, very long memory shard with insulating materials (easy to create with ridiculously sharp human skin-knives in the form of a grating), heat it at one end to cause heating at the other end, allowing for long-distance communications. If it always feels the same temperature regardless of heat sources, place it in an environment with a different temperature (e.g. outside) and harvest energy from the heat exchange. Export it to the tropics for refrigeration.\n\nAlso: these memory shards add with the Stasis cannons to make perfect pneumatic cannons. Place 1 L of memory ice in the back end of a Stasis barrel, which has one tiny hole in the back. Have someone stand against the back of the Stasis barrel, touching the memory ice through the hole. Have them Stasis their body, except for a cubic micrometer around the hole and whatever else is necessary to be safe. Have them enter the memory ice, and wait there until the memory ice will completely sublimate upon leaving. Then, have them leave. 1000L of sublimated steam propels the projectile forward, having nowhere else to go because it is completely surrounded by infinitely strong materials.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422054475", "subreddit": "rational", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Nerd Haus is where we play League of Legends (alternating between being the most amazing game in the world and OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS STUPID I'M UNINSTALLING). We make fun of each other and occasionally do giveaways and viewer games. We get salty af and yell obscenities. We feed our friends pentakills. We are 2Lanez and saxopedo, a married couple who never fights outside of League. We play normals rather than ranked; we play to have fun and to illustrate the fact that you don't have to be Diamond to have a good time. Along with our Stream Team (Amster, Apti, Alan, Tactical-senpai, and occasionally some others) we spend our evenings on the Fields of Justice. \n\n[2Lanez:](http://youtu.be/1wu_kb7TB5c) \nHe mains jungle with Trundle, Udyr, and Shaco. He loves the split push tactic and taking towers while the enemy team is chasing his ADC. He used to main ADC but playing with his wife has lowered his tolerance for laning with another human being. He enjoys making stupid puns. No, like seriously stupid puns that you know you shouldn't laugh at, but you can't help it. And he thinks he's Trick2G. \n\n[Saxopedo:](http://youtu.be/Re-KvtxWwRE)\nShe mains support with Leona, and occasionally Morgana or Janna or Thresh or...basically any support. But Leona's her girl. She loves to start fights and get in peoples' faces. Please, please don't ask her to ADC. Sometimes, if she REALLY HAS TO, she'll go top or mid. She enjoys long walks on the beach and talking smack to everyone, regardless of team alignment. \n“U WOT M8? Fite me irl I fockin dare ya.” \n\n2Lanez is the main host of the stream. Yes, he's pretty. No, you can't have his number. On Fridays, Saxo takes over for the BOT SPOTLIGHT (which means you get to see how mean she really is to her ADC). \n\nYou can find us at [The Nerd Haus](http://www.twitch.tv/nerdhaus), Mondays through Saturdays, starting at 6:30 PM MST. You can also check out our [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/nerdhausna) or our [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/nerdhausna). \n\nWe hope you'll stop by for an evening!

The benefit from fielding large numbers of drones in the Predator class would be marginal. \n\nIt all has to do with doctrine.

{"body": "Not in Canada, but I could make an account and use it.\n\nHere is my joke:\n\nThis story happened a while ago in Dublin, and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale, its said to be true!\n\nJohn Bradford, a Dublin University student, was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm. \n\nThe night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door.. only to realise there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on \n\nThe car started moving slowly. John looked at the road ahead and saw a bend approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the bend, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the window and turned the wheel. John, paralysed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him. \n\nShortly thereafter John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength, he jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just had. \n\nA silence enveloped the pub when everybody realised he was crying and.... wasn't drunk. \n\nSuddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath. Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other... \n\n'Look Paddy.....there's that fooking idiot that got in the car while we were pushing it!'", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422343878", "subreddit": "RandomActsOfGaming", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

What was the base price of oil incorporated into the budget in 2008 and in 2014-2015?\n\n\"By this logic, the US government should have been downgraded to junk status because of \"quasi-sovereign\" debt in the banks and Fanny and Freddie in 2008, because in addition to the debt clock, we're now going to add the debts of everyone that is 'too big to fail' to the list and assign sovereign ratings just on that.\"\n\nPlease do me a favor and list all the American quasi-sovereign ratings that are underpinned by implied support from US. Most of large corporates and large banks (with the exception of foreign subs) enjoy this in Russia. Is direct borrowing from the FED by an oil company (like Rosneft did repeatedly in Dec 14 and Jan 15) a normal day in the US? Rating agencies have methodology. For supported and unsupported ratings, you know.\n\nI seriously doubt all the stuff that you wrote about yourself, so what? You repeatedly state the same strange things (rating = default probability) which you fail to substantiate at all and instead refer me to the basic stuff in investopedia. That's not how a respectable expert discussion is carried out.\n\nPS Why do you think that everyone who knows what CFA is sells \"crappy\" mutual funds if you do not do this yourself?

{"body": "&gt; Egypt? You really think that Egypt was black? I'm sorry, but that is simply not the case.\n\n\nThey were not black, they were North African. But I never claimed they were black I claimed they were African. And the only time Egypt was ever white was under the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was long after the peak of Egyptian civilization. \n\n&gt; Carthage also was not black, their original homeland was around today's Lebanon.\n\nActually, it was around Tunasia. \n\n&gt; Descendants of Mohammed? Yeah...once again... With yemeni, persians, and turks to add their architecture and culture.\n\n\nI'm not sure you understand that Africa is more than just a single country in sub-saharan Africa. Also, you seem to have conveniently ignored that dozen or so other non-North African civilizations. Or did you just hope I wouldn't notice? \n\n&gt; Pretty sure it was Danzig or war. Poland refused to give the German cities/people back to Germany.\n\nYeah, how dare they refuse to be invaded and annexed? \n\n&gt; On the Gleiwitz incident.\nhttp://carolynyeager.net/gleiwitz-%E2%80%9Cfalse-flag%E2%80%9D-incident-pure-fiction\n\nI love the claims in that article, such as that apparently the person never existed, despite having quite obvious records that he did. Not only this, but I find it amusing that according to this sub, everything is a false flag, except apparently when it doesn't suit their views.\n\n&gt; No, just read the newspapers I brought up again until it sinks in, they claimed that 6 million Jews were being exterminated, you try to explain the context but it's wrong/lies.\n\nI read them, and that's why I said what I did. Next I suppose you'll link me that \"Judea declares war on Germany\" headline and claim that it means there was an actual declaration of war.\n\n\n&gt; Yes, segregation through geographic separation. Whites deserve to have our living space and to preserve our way of life/culture that we built up and protected through wars.\n\nNot really, no.\n\n&gt; U wot m8? Citations and sources plz, like I give.\n\nWhat part of *According to Merriam-Webster*, did you not see? \n\n&gt; Yeah like these children did? http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/rotherham-child-grooming-scandal-tearing-4508666\n\nYou've already linked that. I can and will bet you money that for every time you claim a non-white race doing something like this, I can link you an example of a white person doing something equally unacceptable. \n\n&gt; Or this 19 year old Zac Evans who was hacked to death by a machete wielding \"immigrant\"\n\nWow, *two whole events*. This *clearly* proves that all immigrants are evil.\n\n&gt; That's right, the United States (US) was founded by whites, and had White only immigration and citizenship laws. Jewish Anti Defamation League pushed to change this and it's been a miserable change.\n\nExcept that like I said, there were already people living there. Secondly, there were far looser immigration laws far before 1965. I'm still unsure why you seem convinced that the US was only white before 1965.\n\n&gt; We used to be over 90% of the United States, now we are close to under 60% and will be a minority in some decades in the future. \n\nAnd?\n\n&gt; How is that NOT ethnic cleansing?\n\nBecause anyone who's not 3 years old realizes it's not ethnic cleansing.\n\n&gt; We are too busy and working too much to have the birth rates we used to, while non-whites are paid benefits to breed. (Housing, additional child tax credit, medicaid, food stamps, social security without working)\n\nBecause white people are not allowed access to any of those things? \n\n&gt; That's what diversity is at the end of the day, a cost burden on the ethnic whites and a toll in blood through this savage violence even against our children.\n\nYou're telling me that it's the \"White man's burden\"? Nice try. And frankly, when it comes to being a burden on society, I'd be willing to rank you as being far more of a burden than anyone from those races you seem to despise.\n\n&gt; Also please, DO go on about these ILLUSTRIOUS \"African empires\", it's been hilarious.\n\nI did.

He threatened to retire when the team wouldn't renegotiate his deal (that had 2 years left on it) and acted like he should have the same clout as a 3 time NFL MVP.\n\nIf anything - Walker's ignominous exit from Green Bay should have been the first evidence of how much of fookin wizard Ted Thompson is. Locker room malcontent tears his ACL, then has only one year left on his rookie deal, and is somehow traded for a SECOND ROUND DRAFT PICK (that then turned into Greg Jennings!)\n\nEventually, the Raiders paid him $21 million dollars for 15 receptions over two seasons. One of the worst contracts the Raiders ever gave out - and that's saying something.\n\nTL;DR: Glad to see Walker is doing fine.

{"body": "~WOTLK~\nI recommend dalaran-wow.\n\nKeep in mind it's progressive so instead of going into ICC you will be going into Naxx. This gives you WOTLK with a slight change of pace. If you don't like the x1 (x3 with refer-a-friend) then I totally understand but if you are looking for a new place to call your WOTLK home I highly recommend dalaran.\n\nI'm going to paste my experience that I had written in another thread because I believe it has some information.\n\nI had 2 geared 80's on molten. I only donated for a faction change and as a result I effectively lost everything.\nThey give your coins back and I can make free 80's to replace my toons but the gear is all gone.\n\nAs a result I looked into Dalaran-WoW and have been playing there for a couple of days now. I am very happy with what I have seen so far.\n\nDalaran apparently has better raid scripts. I pm'd a guy who was running naxx and he said the boss fights were flawless. He couldn't think of a bug off the top of his head. That's really it as far as my knowledge on endgame scripts go. There are plenty of videos out there you can find to research that more.\n\nDalaran has presented me with a totally different experience from molten and I'm going to attempt to illustrate how.\n\nThere seems to be (from my experience) a much higher concentration of native english speakers. For some this isn't a big deal but it bothered me on molten.\n\nThe community seems to be a lot nicer. I have ran into a lot more friendly people on dalaran than on molten. This is subjective and I am biased, keep that in mind.\n\nMy friend and I (we used the refer-a-friend system to get x3 experience) have noticed a drastic decrease in bugged starter zone quests. I think I have found 1 bugged quest so far and I've done 70 or so quests. There is a quality to the questing on dalaran-wow and I really appreciate it.\n\nThe 1x leveling experience (mostly x3 since I am using the refer-a-friend bosot) is actually something I am enjoying even though I said I would never do it again. It really presents a stop and smell the roses type experience and allows you to enjoy the game more. The 14x leveling experience really felt rushed and wasn't that fun. I got to the end result faster but honestly leveling can be fun too, especially dungeon grinding using rdf with a premade group.\n\nWe have had hell obtaining enough gold to buy skills and mounts but we have both been able to pull it off and it has been a rewarding experience. Molten has 14x exp so you don't really quest you just do 1 quest per zone and move on. I like actually questing and enjoying the old world. The upped money drops on molten and the inflated economy make money a non-issue which seemed cool but now that I'm living the poor life.. I kind of enjoy it. It makes everything a calculated struggle.\n\nI am leveling a healer and have been running dungeons all day (level 18-26) and had nearly back to back rdf queue's. Part of my day has been running with the same few guys so your results may vary. Due to molten going down there is a huge influx of lower level players and it is entirely possible to use the Random dungeon finder to enjoy some old dungeons such as VC, SFK, WC ect.\n\nOverall I'm super happy that I made the move and hope my experience may sway you one way or the other.\nIf you decide to check out dalaran, I play alliance (I know..) I would love to invite you to the leveling guild I was invited to. 20+ active people on around the clock and a guild bank with some starter greens and such in it.\n\nI would also recommend if you could, using the refer-a-friend with 2 accounts + dual boxing to get the x3 experience.

If you're using Heavy armour do not use a chest piece untill you have at least 75 skill in it, the casting penalty even with perks is far too heavy early on without the fortify magic school enchants.\n\nStart with  gloves and boots first and wear cloth chest and head, something like the Vanilla vigilants. You'll probably want to buy yourself an amulet of Mara from riften for 200g and save up for an adept or apprentice restoration robe from the College, training in alchemy is a great way to pay for this. Also the blessing of Mara is also brilliant as it grants fortify restoration 10%, it will also grant +50 health if you do the Agent of Mara Quest. Blessing of Arkay will grant 75% magicka regen if you've read 75 books in total and will grant +75 health when you've slain 250 undead (takes fooking ages unless you have the Draugr invasion mod)\n\nIt will take a while but you can a build up a fortify restoration jewelry set if you keep checking the clothing merchants in solitude and Riften, sometimes the court mages will carry something it's bascially down to luck really. You can find a Master level restoration robe during the Vermena quest but that requires investment illusion to mess with the orcs and acolytes minds since you're not using weapons and can't have your follower in with you.\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422717013", "subreddit": "skyrimrequiem", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I actually had to use it once when we went out with his mother, her friend (a cop), and his cousins who were visiting from Ireland and wanted to see american clubs (boyfriend and his girlfriend now married too). I was dancing with a guy when he tried to get touchy and \"no\" was apparently not registering with this dude. My, now husband, stepped in and diverted the attention with a \"Hey I'm back with your drink *here hold my beer*\". The guy swung my husband around in frustration and some words began to fly. The disbelief was when it was not one guy my husband swung around to but 3 guys. Now suddenly I get pushed aside by his BIG stocky Irish cousin looking for a brawl to start. Me and his mother luckily waved a couple bouncers down and they grabbed the 5 of them JUST as fists were about to fly. They let my husband and his cousin go when we told them that I called for help. When we walked out the guy was sitting on the edge of a curb with cop standing behind him. I had to laugh after because the whole ride back his cousin was drunkenly complaining how he wanted to see if american fights were \"fookin pussy slap fights or real fights\" I don't think I ever laughed so hard or forget the way he said it too.\n\nThe story is actually a lot longer a more was involved in that crazy night but that was the only part relating to the conversation on signals.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422743713", "subreddit": "BabyBumps", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
