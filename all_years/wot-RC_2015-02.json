Never the less the fun hasn't ended yet. \n\n**Episode 57**\n\n* The three Ninja's are coming together *teehee*\n* People are beginning to realize the true nature of the Fuhrer\n* The guy who created the Fuhrer?\n* Those dolls trained exactly like Bradley by their style of fighting\n* \"Shit I passed out\" You got cut up man, you can stay down for awhile, don't want you to die.\n* NO OLD MAN\n* Lan fan where are you\n* \"A king exists for his people\" and his people exist for him ;_;\n* King Bradley didn't even bat an eye lid\n* No don't talk like you're both going to die ;_;\n* Here is everyone struggling to kill any of them and then there is Hawkeye just killing them left and right\n* Aww yeah they met in the middle. It was no coincidence, the ship gods ordained it.\n* Satsuki doesn't know it but if she had been asked that question with the knowledge that the mohawk bear is dead...she would still give the same answer ;_;\n* It's happening!!!\n* We were promised and FMAB has delivered\n* Figured it wouldn't matter where they were so long as they were in the city\n* Didn't see the fifth sacrifice but people assured me it had already been established that Mustang was the fifth so not really expecting a surprise.\n\n**Episode 58**\n\n* Huh mustang didn't go with them, although evil doctor man did assure us that he would go eventually, wonder why the delay\n* Like falling into water will hurt him\n* Spartans, prepare for glory ;_;\n* Greed would be a good contender for best sin actually\n* Hughes ;_;\n* She is totally going to find Wrath in water before brutally slicing him to death\n* Satsuki being a hardass\n* WOAH WHAT THE HELL HAS HE DONE TO HOHENHEIM\n* Absorbing Hohenheim is sure to work against him later\n* Will Al be getting his body back? *HYPE*\n* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n* FUVDGKGSGFDHFDJDJGS\n* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n* ;_; \n* What...what am I supposed to do with my life now? Is it even worth living anymore?\n* FUCKING USE SPACE MAGIC OR SOMETHING MUSTANG! IF YOU LET HER DIE I QUIT!\n* SAY YES YOU BASTARD\n* WHO CARES ABOUT THE COUNTRY?!? HAWKEYE IS WORTH TWO COUNTRIES\n* \"I will\" DAMN FUCKING RIGHT\n\n**Episode 59**\n\n* Um? She is kind of bleeding out here whilst you monologue guys...\n* MAYMAY YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING YOU CAN USE HEALY MAGIC, RIGHT??!\n* That Philos stone getting kicked around everywhere is like something straight out a comedy show\n* MAYMAY CHOOSE CAREFULLY RIGHT NOW. DON'T MAKE ME JUMP THROUGH THE SCREEN AND KICK YOUR ASS, IMMORTAL OR NOT\n* God damn [don't ever do that to me again ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/WrS6cGM.png) my heart can only take so much\n* Oh great, *he*, is here. Convenient. \n* Gracia it's time to show up.\n* Madam President would also be a good character to show up here, unlikely though...\n* Well how they trapped Mustang was pretty awesome. So with Wrath no longer able to regenerate he will be the one to die in order for him to go through the gate? or is the doctor enough?\n* OH SO NOW YOU BAIT HAWKEYE DYING BUT THEN SWITCH IT WITH MUSTANG? FU\n* Pride is just going to eat you my friend. He is a hungry motherfucker\n* Maybe not then\n* WHAT? HE CAN NEVER SEE HAWKEYES FACE AGAIN? HOW WILL HE BE ABLE TO SEE HER IN THE WEDDING DRESS? AAAAAAGGGRRRHHHHHH FU FMAB\n* Truth is a meticulous bastard. It seems like he almost wants Father to succeed \n* For Armestris!\n* Fir Ishval!\n* For my brother!\n* Oh is he going to have to give up his body in order to return to Ed?\n* So he is coming back in armour. Problem I see is that his body is rejecting his soul a lot now. I don't know if it will last until/after the final confrontation. Human Al seemed to know that which is why he looked so defeated imo. \n* Well he explains that it is because Al was the necessary 5th sacrifice. A fair point. Then again MayMay could have just been forced through it like Mustang so maybe he's thinking a bit of both\n\n**Episode 60**\n\n* Nothing like a good side character ship to fill the intermission\n* \"Eye of Heaven, gateway of Earth\"- Seems as though we will get the country sized circle this episode\n* '[1v1 rust scrub](http://i.imgur.com/5Xu8e6I.png). I'll rek u, swer on me mum' \n* 'Quit using hacks noob'\n* Scar is some kind of genius and I've yet to figure out why\n* RECONSTRUCTION IN YO FACE\n* Time for some duel of fates!\n* Hughes family better not get devoured FYI\n* \"The centre of the world belongs to me\" Greed is too good\n* I want to see this massive eye\n* HOOOOOOOOOOLY it's even crazier than I imagined. \n* NOOOOO don't kill everyone ;_;\n* Winry ;___________;\n* There is going to be a way to prevent these peeps from properly dying, I'm sure\n* WOAH HE IS HUGE\n* By the looks of it, you already are a part of him, bro\n* Well every exploded, 10/10 great story, when is the next rewatch?\n\nAh that cliffhanger wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Still want to see the conclusion but at least it wasn't some end like Winry/Hawkeye/May/Fan clutching Eds/Mustangs/Alphonse/Ling's dying body. \n\nTomorrow is the last day. I'm hoping for tons of ship focused fanservice, the ending is second only to this. \n\nMake me proud FMAB, you asshole.

That mus' mean you can't have no more than tree maybe four shots left.\" the thief stated inquisitively.\n\n\"You'd be Yankee fahkin Doodle ta' tink I ain't got more bullets, now get da fuck out of here or I'm killin' the both of ya's.\" I responded quickly. \n\n\"Okay boy o, were hoofin' it.\" I saw them walk off into the distance heart racing praying that it did not get worse than that unpleasant exchange. Picking up my lantern and cautious all the while slowly moving towards to where they were to see the mess they'd made. I momentarily took my eyes off the direction they had left looking down at a grave the day shift had dug moving my light closer to it. \n\nIt was not the corpse of a human I'd ever seen, the inside of the pine box was filled with goo and what lay there was more similar to a giant bat. I was transfixed by the sight of it dropping my guard when one of the grave robbers ran at me from the shadows with a shovel. Numbness, darkness, but not dead, the last thing I remembered was falling into the hole with that thing.   \n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422937723", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Cheshire and I first met through Sintralin, as he pointed out. At the time I was deeply involved with Papa_Pound and knew that we were going to break Clone's vault in order to to free myself in Odiingrad. For whatever reason, most likely he was bored of sitting in his own corner of the map, Cheshirelulcat decided to tag along. We kept his secret until he proved him idiocy for the first time, when he decided he would tell several untrustworthy people that he was raiding on an alternate account.\n\nThanks for the ad hominem. \n\n&gt;After the schism in that group, he was invited to come live at the Iceheart Citadel (or whatever the Hell it's called) with the rest of us. He declined to move an account there, yet still argued for voting rights, which I fought to earn him. I lost that battle, unfortunately. From hereon out we had minimal contact with him, as he'd rather manipulate Mount Augustans than sit with people who called him a true friend. He took this a step further when he offered people who are -- at least in-game -- our enemy, Titan, a private creative server, despite us having asked several times, including ten minutes beforehand only to be refused.\n\nI tried to separate my time between the two groups as appropriately as possible. Sorry I wasn't on your beck and call 24/7, I had a job and other social obligations, as well as familial problems. I didn't really care about voting rights, that was more of a joke, like calling the city \"catville\" (lol). I never offered anyone a private server, I've only got one which is being used for a Babylon build right now. \n\n&gt;Normally I would have been fine with this, except he added on to it \"you guys will never accomplish anything. Papa is the only person on the server with the capability to do something, and you'll only be jealous of him\". That pissed me off. Quite a bit.\n\nNever said anything like this, please do not put words in my mouth. I expressed my opinion that I do not think WP will win this in the short run, no matter what people do. I never said you'll only be jealous of him either, literally nothing in there is true. And if it made you mad, you should've told me. \n\n&gt;While he can say I don't value friendships and use friends as a tool to further my own lucrative gains, I can say the exact same as demonstrated by himself. He threw away a long friendship with multiple people when he decided to throw his lots in with people trying to eradicate his friend group. That's not cool, and I don't think that should go unpunished\"\n\n???? I haven't done this. Sorry for being friends with people you dislike. Who punishes their friends for shit? uwot m8? If you think I've done something, **tell me**. I asked you many times what was wrong and you refused to answer me, and instead spouted stonato-esque cryptic ass bullshit.\n\n&gt;As it was no real secret, I let Clone know that Cheshire was giving them a private server, which is a grey area when it comes to legality, as it affects the game on the server, yet does not take place on the server itself. Clone said it would be dealt with accordingly if I supplied him with the proof, which does still exist. I instead said I'll just watch him and assume he'll stop it eventually, and decided a better punishment for him would be just to scare him and upset him.\n\nFirst of all, I did not supply a private server to Papa or Hantzu or \"the bad guys\", they've all been playing on my survival server (which you threatened to DDOS by the way, I don't know what that would accomplish) with mount augusters, we've been having a blast. Second, who spies on their own friends and reports to someone else? What the fuck? \n\n&gt;I didn't and still don't want him to be stopped from playing as he is not doing anything directly in game, and the fact that this is between him and myself. While it's cruel and unusual, that I did to him served to show him that you can't turn your backs on old friends and support their enemies without any sort of retaliation. The incessant \"ha you're useless and altbanned\" and \"yeah you're a fucking retard for attacking titan\"pisses far more people than just me off, and it's more than appropriate that someone finally hurts him for it.\n\nIt's not just between me and you anymore. It's gotten to the point where you (at least claim) intentionally deceive other people, absolutely blatantly, to get them to do what you want. You literally admitted it to me. Who the fuck does that man? Who punishes their friends?  ha you're useless and altbanned?  I only said that about an hour ago after you'd already threatened me and my friends. \n\nPlease, there's already evidence against you. Just stop. You are making yourself look worse man.

Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna \"get some\" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:\"/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]KalikaTheCat 1 point 5 hours ago \n/u/bitlington\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]bitlington 0 points 4 hours ago \nepic\npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]JMachin 0 points 5 hours ago \nwat \npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]m0ondoggy 1 point 4 hours ago \nWAT! \npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]bitlington 1 point 5 hours ago \nDank Meme\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]Ricksta571 [+1] 1 point 4 hours ago \nMe too?\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]Skisquatch 1 point 4 hours ago \nComcast\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]lazy_when_drunk 1 point 4 hours ago \nDO NOT NOT GIVE ME GOLD\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]IM_DAY_MAN_AMA 1 point 4 hours ago \nMe instead plz\npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]Phele 1 point 4 hours ago \nU wot m8?\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]D_CHRIST 1 point 4 hours ago \nThis.\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]sai911 [S] 1 point 4 hours ago \nIt's raining Gold !\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]browman25 1 point 4 hours ago \neh pls\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]ThatDaveNextDoor 1 point 4 hours ago \nDAE VACCINATIONS?\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]Supaa 1 point 4 hours ago \nEdit: thanks for the gold\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]pickledspiders 1 point 4 hours ago \nEdit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]K_Lobstah -1 points 4 hours ago \nWho the fuck would be desperate enough for gold that they'd come to this piece of shit subreddit and leave a comment where anyone in the world could see it???slash?\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]sai911 [S] 4 points 4 hours ago \nYou jelly??\npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]K_Lobstah 0 points 4 hours ago \nI'd be jelly if you had a couple tendies in your pocket ;)\npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]sai911 [S] 5 points 4 hours ago \nI actually do http://imgur.com/kSIt4Bx \npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]K_Lobstah 4 points 4 hours ago \nMFW \npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply\n[–]KoreanEwok 1 point 4 hours ago \nThis doesn't have anything to do with autism\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\n[–]SuperCho 1 point 4 hours ago \nFinally!

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.

We voted to reject the Lisbon treaty!'\n\n'Well, Paddy,' Sarkozy replied, 'This is indeed important news!

That makes eleven!'\n\nSarkozy paused. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 100,000 men in my army waiting to move on my command.'\n\n'Begoora!' says Paddy.

'And what equipment would that be Paddy?' Sarkozy asks.\n\n'Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.'\n\nSarkozy sighs amused. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 6,000 tanks and 5,000 armoured personnel carriers. Also, I have increased my army to 150,000 since we last spoke.'\n\n'Saints preserve us!' says Paddy. 'I'll have to get back to you.'\n\nSure enough, Paddy rings again the next day. 'Mr. Sarkozy, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We have modified Jackie McLaughlin's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four boys from the Shamrock Bar have joined us as well!'\n\nSarkozy was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 100 bombers and 200 fighter planes. My military bases are surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. And since we last spoke, I have increased my army to 200,000!'\n\n'Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!' says Paddy, 'I will have to ring you back.'\n\nSure enough, Paddy calls again the next day.

{"body": "The Iron-born are their own issue, because so much of their story involves naval battles, which are prohibitively expensive to film, although *Black Sails* might beg to differ.  The big cut from the books that I see coming is there will be no battle of Mereen in the show.  The two battles that got the full treatment from D&amp;D (BlackWater, and a combined version of the battles at the Wall) while epic TV viewing, were not and could not measure up to the scale of what was described in the books.  In Season 1, they took the cheap way out and we got Tyrion knocked out before a big battle, not to mention the other 3-4 battles of Robb's that took place off screen.  So there is a history of omitting the expensive battles in favor of more intimate Boss fights (Ned v Jaime, Drogo v Mago, Jon v a Fooking Legend, Brienne v Hound).  \n\nBecause Victorian's two major roles so far in the books have been to get 93 ships to Dany and be the naval cavalry coming to save the day for Barry Bold, having these 2 plot points dealt with means he is no longer necessary.  I think Euron will be in but pushed back a Season, a la Ramsey and the Reeds.  I also think Aegon VI will be incorporated through Trystane Martell.  His primary purpose in the books appears to be battling Dany to be the ruling Targaryen.  I think this plot point is critical because it will spoil Dany's coming home party which will majorly impact her role in the endgame.\n\nHaving said all that, there is no indication that any of the omitted characters will not be critical in the books.  It just shows those plots in the books may not be critical to the series endgame in a concise adaptation.   \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423063444", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**For Thresh:** I usually put a point in Q for the level 1 hook, as it establishes lane dominance like a motherfucker. Secondly, I max Q when the lane is easy, max W second if the enemy/my ADC is mostly immobile, and lantern them out whenever I even see the jungler coming or their lane starts going aggressive, as it usually makes them fall back, which is a good moment to strike.\n\nI max E second when I will be using it a lot, like against a Leona to cancel her E, or a Lee camping, a Katarina mid, or anything that really gets fucked by your OP Flay. Alternatively, most pros and koreans put 3 points in E before maxing Q, which is good for the lane presence on the AA-poke and for lane-engaging. If try harding, it is fully recommended.\n\nAs for the ult, get used to the range and activation time so as to engage with it in lane. Most of the time, when you hit a sentence and go for the all-in, you'll force a flash (depending on how scared the enemy is of your ADC), and the flash usually is used after the lockdown time of your Q and E, and it dodges your ult. Hitting them with your ult after backwards-E (which reduces the cast time, if I'm not mistaken) garantees that you get the ult dmg down.\nA neat trick to escape a jungler+mid laner gank when too pushed up into their lane when on blue side is to go in the direction of their tower and throw your lantern to your ADC. As they click on it, flash the little wall beside their tower and make every Silver scrub shit their pants.\n\n**For Leona:** Your actual power spike is at level 3, as your shield is absurdly good for trading. Max W first, then put 3 points in E to equal the cooldown of both Zenith Blade and your stun, and then max both accordingly. \nYou can easily take down wards other supports place in your brush with a AA-Q-AA combo, and then say \"Yum.\" in all chat so they feel subjugated.\n\nIf against a Morgana, use your E on her but don't press Q until you see her shield being used. If she uses in on herself, turn to their ADC and bash 'is fooking brains in. If you cannot close the gap to their ADC, fall back and wait for the cooldown on your E (it is much shorter than Morgana's shield's) and proceed to kill their ADC. Works with Ult as well. This whole tactic works wall against Janna too, but don't treat them equally, Janna's peel is much more intense.\n\nIf against a Thresh, walk into them for a stun, if he uses his E to peel you back, use your E to get to their ADC. Try not to stray too much from your lane partner or you'll look dumb and eat free damage. Ult Thresh as his ADC clicks his lantern for a easy double-stun.\n\n**For Janna:** Early on, don't die.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423155684", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Struck up a conversation with someone who asked me where my jersey was, I mentioned that I'd left it at home since I was going to a concert later and Puma shirts are brittle, and then I realized what a grave error I'd made when he assumed it was a new shirt and asked \"Who's name do you have?\" and I said \"Van der Vaart.\" Never seen anyone go from 0 to \"u wot m8\" that fast.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the rambling, but there's always a sizable group of Tottenham fans at Meehan's in Atlantic Station!

First of all the pronunciation - vast amounts of vowels, diphthongs and even triphthongs makes every English beginner wanting to quit. Then we have the spelling which is a chapter for itself. Then articles. Their usage varies from dialect to dialect. Then the phrasal verbs. Make up, make out, pull out, put in, etc - you have to learn these by heart. If learned as separate parts, phrasal verbs won't make any sense. Then the word order. Compared to vast majority of Indo-European languages, it's relatively stiff and you can't say something like \"Bored in the school am today I\". Then the vast amount of tenses - where most of the languages have 3-4 tenses, English has like 12? Modal verbs are also a pain in the ass. Oh, and don't forget that every grammatical rule has some exceptions too. Really lovely.\n\nI could go on but I will stop right there.

In addition : his ult is great at protecting carries from ganks, he only needs a soul ring to be set in mana for all game long making it less costly than others strong disablers like shadow shaman.\n\nThat makes morphling a mini void when paired with another support that has pure nuke.

Morph says : \"fuck that man, I got 900 range at 42% uptime and 1000 range mobility spell, He also only need a soul ring and hes unkillable, the downside is that he doesnt do damage, that why you need a strong nuker but thats never whats missing in pubs.\n\nThat makes him a really, really good roaming role 5 when you have nukers. You adaptive strike, the dude is dead, end of this story. This is a hero with a 900 range super dragon trail on 10 seconds cooldown and a built in blink. Seriously, you get tranqs (for armor+movespeed)+soul ring and youre set for all game long. Grab a blink now and you can initiate from **3100 RANGE**. Or you can get a blademail and go stand in skywrath ultimate. Or you could start building auras like a treant.\n\nHis ult is the just the cherry on top of the sundae, its an escape, it confuses enemies, it creates spaces, it allows you to farm, it allow the carry to farm, it allow you to split push, it saves tp money,~~it allows you to buyback and get back like an ember~~...\n\nHes a one trick guy but hes really, really good at it.\n\nSome good morph support teammates :\n\n- Nukers : Visage, Skywrath, Lina, Gyro, Huskar, Shadow fiend, timbersaw, tinker, meepo...\n\n- Good people to use your ult on, with great passives or really good base stats : Centaur, Axe, Tiny, Shadow fiend, Terrorblade, PA...\n\n- Carries that deals a shitton of damage early : Drow, Shadow fiend, Sniper, Clinkz, lina, Slardar, windrunner, TA, PA, Nightstalker...\n\n- Hard to land skillshots/nuke :  Mirana, Pudge, Windrunner, Lina, Invoker, meepo, Kunkka (Stun duration is greater than the boat travel time by the way), Shadow fiend.\n\nI think Shadow fiend is his best teammate. 4.25 seconds stun is enough for 3 easy razes and its enough time to completly charge the ultimate in adition. Plus, he can just right click the guy if he has max souls. Shadow fiend illusions are also really great, they get the damage and aura.\n\nIts really good against carries that dislike to build BKB and also against every glass cannon, every hero that morphling like to make an illusion of and aditionally its really great against... Crystal maiden. You make an illusion of her and get her aura.\n\nThe standard item build would be something like : Tranqs+soul ring+Blink+stick+support shits. Medaillon is situational is some of your nuking is physical like WD ult, Familiars (if visage is too fucking stupid to get medaillon of his own) or good right click like lina, PA, Nightstalker, TA... Then I would get a blademail, aura items like a gem, vlads, drums, shivas, AC or classical support items like a sheep, atos, HH, force or orchid. I wouldnt get eblade to try to transition into a standard morph because you need to be morphed into str to be able to stun.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423316584", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

The one time he gets a cross in it's overhit and goes for opposition throw out the other side.  When he decides to take a man on he slows down and stops so van P and Rooney or whoever else was making runs to head it in are lost and have to check back in to be onside again.  The whole attack stalls and the opponents are back in position to defend in lines.  Valencia meanwhile is still facing one or two defenders before deciding what to do.  It's always either play it back to center mid or go on the outside and smash it against the fullback hoping for a corner.  He ruins entire counters and built up attacks when it goes to him.  \n\nHe's shite.\n\nAsking me what I remember... I remember us having wingers who TERRORISED the premier league.

I want to know. \n\n&gt;so many that she felt the need to vacate her home, and cancel speaking events.\n\nFunny that when you quote her she says that she cancelled because the school didnt bend to her demands. \n\n&gt;The point here is not how good Sarkeesian is at analyzing games,\n\nU Wot m8!? That's the point! The videos create false scenarios and claims! How can a discussion happen when the source is straight up BS?\n\n&gt;The questions then become: what is the role of violence in art; how does art illustrate the present mindset of society\n\nNo the question is why does the human brain like playing tag. That's because we are hunters, we are practicing stuff that we are suposed to be using as adults . Stuff all animals do. \n\nBut since now we are more advanced we have more advanced versions of playing tag to practice our hunting skills. Violence in our entertainment is as old as freaking humanity itself. Seeing violence in games is not changing anything about us. \n\nWell, actually it is. We dont actually know go to the Coliseum to see poeople ACTUALLY get injured and killed. Now we just make believe in games.  \n\nYou want us to not think about hunting? Guess what? That's not going to stop if all video games magically turn into Super Mario Bros. Specially since in Mario you ARE killing the enemy. But mostly because this is how we are wired. \n\n&gt;having sub-par self-regulation in terms of exposing impressionable, often young people to violent scenes.\n\nI have this idea, check it out. \nThe people that created this young people, (which i like to call the young people trainers) these people control what the young people are exposed to. \n\nThese young people trainers set rules on what type of television to watch, what type of films, books, and games to enjoy. And these young people trainers can even teach the young ones that what happens in these films and games are not real life. In real life you cannot heal by drinking a potion. \n\nHow about this idea?\n\n&gt; are different rules needed to govern content that asks and allows users to interact with violent imagery, some of which is man-on-woman violence?\n\nNope. Because it's not real. Did your young people trainer teach you this? If my female young people trainer saw me beating up a girl for no reason she would kick my ass 10 times worst and tell me not do it again or else the male young people trainer was going to come in and he is waaaay stronger. \n\nNow, people up the young ones is not cool now so you have to develop new techniques. \n\n&gt;Studies abound demonstrating a link between exposure to mature video game content and aggression later in life,\n\nWhat studies?\n\n&gt;The direct interaction of the participating players is what sets video game art apart, and what makes violence in games a greater concern for groups seeking tighter regulation.\n\n50 Shades of Grey was created by a fan taking control of the story of a book. This fan took the sexual tension in a book she liked and turned up to a 10. It's the same thing. The original story is not changed but she took control and created her own version. \n\n&gt;More worrying still, perhaps the explicit violence in video games — particularly gender-based violence — has now become a barometer for how society treats rape and other acts of gender-based violence. \n\nWTF? We need a whole mess or sources on this. \nYou think the huge rape problem in the US military happened because of video games and not because of the crazy structure the service has?\n\nYou just went #FullMC here. \n\n&gt;Yet she has received much flack from the gaming community for pointing out a problem that doesn’t need to be fixed. \n\nshe received flack for super late works, stealing work, lies and fabrications. \n\n&gt;Are new rules necessary to regulate the creation of and participation in video games that include gender-based violence? \n\nNope. Cause, know you, you need to prove some is happening first. \n\n&gt;Should the art in video games also be left untouched?\n\nYes. Until you show something is actually happening there is no issue here. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423519286", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The biggest show flaw that everybody is ignoring is the relative lack of sensual pleasures other than murder and sex with prostitutes. \n\n- A lot of the colors have been grayed out and grimied up. \n\n- A lot of the people in the show are very pretty, but it seems like they are often filmed in such a way as to minimize this or tone it down. The \"gaze\", male or female, is severely underused, and things are often filmed from a rather disinterested or suspicious third person perspective.\n\n- There is almost no delicious-looking food in the show. The food scene played up the most is Daenerys eating the horse heart, which is revolting. But even in feast scenes, we see barely anything of all the really delicious food that is described in huge detail in the books *for a reason*.\n\n- There are a lot of horrors, of course. This the show does right. Tons of things are horrible. But the good things, the pretty things, the delicious things, the people in love with each other, even the countryside, are all less nice in the show than they are in the books. Well, except Tyrion, who is much handsomer. Which is fine; the show needs it (and more of it).\n\nThis is important for at least three reasons:\n\n- Reason one: It reinforces cheap bullshit ideas of sex being cheap, dirty and exploitative and violence being more okay than sex is to show in movies and television, which the books rightfully reject as part of their exploration of genre.\n\nThe sex scenes stand out as way out of balance - especially the prostitute scenes. The point of prostitution in the books is that it's *normal.* People have appetites, and prostitutes are normal people who make a business of those appetites, in the same way knights are normal people who make a business of killing. People don't talk about it, but the lion's share of people do it (pun intended).\n\nBut when you have everything grey and drab and grimy and then there's one prostitute and she's a frickin' perfumed centerfold fantasy, it undermined the authenticity of that experience for those characters.\n\nThe way to do this and to be entertaining and to stay true to the spirit of the books is not to tone down the prostitute scenes, but to tone up everything else. \n\nIn the show, when main characters have sex it's considerably less fun to watch than when prostitutes have it, which makes no sense, and the relationships between main characters feel sanitized and cliche as a result. This has a ton of consequences all over the story.\n\nThere should be more scenes like the Loras/Renly shaving scene, the Jaime/Brienne bathtub scene, the Oberyn brothel scene and the rest of the Jon Snow / Ygritte relationship should have been more informed by what happened in the beginning of the cave scene, which kind of flattened out and got less interesting as the scene went on. \n\nFor example -- it's worth noting how much more serious the Robb and Talisa relationship is in the shows than in the books, and how much more choreographed and self-important. Like Talisa has to basically be Doctors Without Borders, making sophisticated pronouncements about war crimes and the injustices of the world right off the bat, and Robb has to admire what she does to help people before anything else, and then he has to show her the basis of how he conducts matters of aspirational governance and altruism as his first move, and we have to see them develop rather complex and advanced sort of admiration for each other before they even address the elephant in the room of their mutual physical attraction. \n\nIn the context of how they did the show, I think it works great, and I love that they do eventually get to the physical attraction and play those scenes a fair amount more honestly than I expected, but in the context of a different show they could have made they might have been able to be a little more authentic and a little less self-consciously moralistic and cliche about the very important idea of normal, sexual people making bad decisions for stupid reasons that are also good reasons.\n\nI mean, I'm not saying love at first sight must be a thing, but \"I'd hit that\" at first sight is definitely a thing, for both men and women, of all persuasions. And in the Game of Thrones show, it barely exists except with prostitutes.\n\nLike, when Walder Frey checks out Talisa, we're grossed out - as if it's irregular for somebody to check out somebody else who is attractive. In a realer reality or a more fantastical fantasy, *everybody* is checking Talisa out; she's gorgeous. Robb sure was. And Talisa's life would be very much informed by the reality that everywhere she went men would be attracted to her -- no amount of artfully placed non-dental filth would change that. And Robb is a sexy guy, too, which never gets to matter (the wildlings talk a fair amount about Jon Snow being pretty, and the actor is pretty, sure, but the way he's shot and the way he performs doesn't really seem to play that out at all. He sure doesn't act like somebody who knows he turns heads.). Instead we address this topic through Walder Frey's weird Victorian anti-prudishness - where we briefly pretend that people aren't sexual beings so that we can transgress against our own restrictions for perverse excitement. It's cheap and tired. \n\nThere should be less tacked-on prostitute lessons scenes. Sex should be part of the story because the tone of the show should invite it to be part of the story. Like in *The Tudors*. If this were the case, it would address a lot of the complaints about how the show handles sex. It would invite new complaints, but those complaints would come from prudes without a leg to stand on, rather than the complaints now, which come from smart people who are generally at least half correct, even though they are being killjoys.\n\nAnd yeah, the violence being allowed to be brutal and visceral while the feast scenes have to be boring and rote to me shows a not particularly serious or mature consideration of the human condition.\n\n- Reason two: Winter is coming. The show has already done summer, and summer was brutal and drab and unpleasant. This was thrilling at the time, but doesn't give them as much room for contrast as they otherwise might have. The show now has to get either super-duper grimdark to the point where I'm a little nervous they'll be able to handle it, or there won't be that much contrast left (as is the case with the \"Fooking Legend\" plotline that could have happened anywhere and didn't have to be beyond the wall for any reason), or everything will just have to be snowy all the time to show that hey, it's winter, and that's going to get kinda boring.\n\n- Reason three: This is really the big one: It is against the spirit of what the series is about, against its aesthetic values, and against the core of what fantasy fiction is about altogether, in the words of George R. R. Martin himself:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hJhmxc3Arw\n\n*\"The best fantasy is written in the language of dreams. It is alive as dreams are alive: more real than real, for a moment at least... that long, magic moment before we wake.*\n\n*\"Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold, and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic done up in mud brown and olive drab.*\n\n*\"Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end.*\n\n*\"Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines.*\n\n*\"Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true?*\n\n*\"We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the song the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us: to the child who dreamed one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever, somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-la.*\n\n*\"They can keep their heaven. When I die, I'd sooner go to Middle-Earth.\"*\n\nSomething as simple as Stannis's beard missing is part of this -- it's important, and we don't need Stannis to look more like a regular middle aged guy. Or Renly's peach being replaced with the sarcastic ham comment. Or how they cut The Bear and the Maiden Fair singing from the Sansa/Oleanna scene (or really the general lack of fun music and singing, which is mentioned a lot in the books). Or the lack of a \"shit gold\" joke. Or the fear of not getting Daario right, which culminated in getting rid of the only thing about Daario that they got right, which was the only thing that mattered (that he was improbably sexy), and replacing him with somebody who looks just like everybody else. But it goes all the way down to the dusty street fight between Ned and Jaime, where Ned didn't look honorable, Jaime didn't look majestic, and the result was a guy walking with a cane who was already going everywhere a little bit hunched over.\n\nWhy does Joffrey get to be more lithe and impressively decadent on the Iron Throne than the Knight of the Flowers ever is on his horse? Because on television things only get to be sensual if they are bad or wrong. And that's a shame. \n\nDon't get me wrong - I love the show, and I think the tone they've struck has a lot to recommend it. And based on what little we know they embraced this spirit in their first attempt at the pilot, which turned out to be horrible. Maybe the show doesn't need a shot in the arm from *Hercules: The Legendary Journeys* or *Xena: Warrior Princess*. But there's a big missed opportunity here, and I think it means the show will always be quite a bit short of the books in terms of how artistically interesting, influential and insightful about life they are.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1423527467", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 97, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd put any youngster ahead of either Muntari and Essien. Once again, I'm remembering Cristante. It's not like he was a world-class player or played amazing games, but that's how you turn a talented played into a really useful squad member. He was definitely better than Muntari and Essien, maybe Poli, too, albeit they are different type of players.\n\nAs for Menez, he's work rate is not that high. \n\n\"It doesn't matter if he dribbles and loses the ball a lot, that is irrelevant.\" - lol, U WOT M8?\n\n\"He is willing to come all the way back to receive the ball, and makes literally everything happen for us on offense.\" \n\nThis is what he must do, it's his job, he must come deeper and get the ball. Our midfield has zero creativity, you must get it somewhere.\n\nNow that he has the ball, guess what? Most of the times he starts dribbling and loses the ball, then he doesn't run to grab the ball. Want a good example of that? The Atalanta game. He received the ball and tried to dribble using his backheel. Guess? Lost the ball, didn't run back, goal Denis, and we lose 0-1. At home. With Atalanta. Menez is exactly the same as Balotelli. There are prime examples of both losing the ball and not defending. Both of them did it sometimes, probably when our fans whistled them.\n\nMenez has scored 12 goals for us and 6 of them are penalties. Fairly similar to Balotelli.\n\nHe's definitely talented, one of our best players, but he's no savior. He hasn't played that good, but who has, really?\n\nAnyway, we're probably watching different games.

Also increases stress relief at campfires if both are in the party.\n\n\n2. You wot mate?: After a night of drinking one insult led to another about someones mother and now the two hold a grudge. They may not be allowed to both be assigned to the same stress relief at the same time. If one of the two is critted or injured in a dungeon it provides stress relief to the one who hate them.\n\n\nBrothel:\n\nLovers: After a passionate night in the towns brothel the two heroes seem inseparable. Increased stress resistance/reduction when in the same party in a dungeon increased benefit if adjacent to each other. Double stress for party member being put into death door if that party member is their lover. Instant stress test if lover dies in dungeon.\n\n\nFlagellation:\n\nBrothers in pain: achieved by assigning two heroes to flagellation at the same time. No stress from teammate dropping into deaths door or being critted. Non-crit wounds have a chance of providing stress relief.

Look up Chris Rock + bullies/fights - he used humor to get out of his fights, which in turn led to his comedy career.\n\n\nExample: Bully says \"u wot m8, I'll deck you right in the gob\", say something along the lines of \"You're gonna fight me? Bro, I can't even fight a burrito from kicking my ass, I'm not in your league dude.\"\n\nMay hit or miss, but it's worth a shot.\n\n\nKnow that walking away/leaving the aggression area is always the smartest move unless your life is literally at stake.\n\n\nEgos and alcohol don't mix in any good way.

{"body": "Elo Hell is not in Bronze, Silver or Gold. It's Platinum. It should be called Elo Hell, not Platinum. Good players around Platinum are as valuable as this thing itself in real life. I can't tell you how many times I have seen people wanting a role so bad they begged us.. many times they failed incredibly hard. I can't tell you how many times thoughts like \"This guy is Plat, how is it that he can't stop feeding?\" went through my head.\n\n\nElo Hell does exist, it's Platinum. People expect others to know things about the game and even if they do know a lot, they might just play without being focused. The seed of toxicity it is. I'd like to play with Bronze players in my team rather than Platinum players because most Platinum players think they are the hawt-shiet and approach ranked games without caring at all, in spite of the fact, that their knowledge is not with what you can make such approach. This is the thing that seizes my mind and body from conquering the ladder. From Bronze players I'd not expect anything. But they might say: \"this guy is Plat, we are Bronze, so let's follow his calls and try to do what he asks us to do\". On the other hand, Platinum players are like:  \"U wot m8, im same elo as you! i dun take orders from ya scrub\".\n\n\n\"But-but.. if you are so good you can carry yourself!\" &lt;- True, but I am not. I have never been in Diamond or Master or Challenger, but I'd like to be and I know I could be. Ambition, passion, longing, desire, enthusiasm, lust, craving, aspiration, thurst? Name it anyhow, I have it.  But I need to progress upwards and not be stalled by careless people. That's the only way I can learn on my own. I have the ability to detect good and bad teamcomps, I know when my champion and others' are useful or the opposite. I know what's a good call and what is a bad call. I know when, where and how to teamfight... The game however, is not made to be carried by one man who knows things, craves the victory, lusts for carnage on the Fields of Justice just so he can have the satisfaction of climbing the ladder. \n\n\nRiot's approach on the game is making it more and more team-action-oriented. You need other people to be successful if you do not yet know more than them to be successful - no matter that you are more focused than anyone else in this damn \"game\", or heck, sometimes your whole team combined. Yet, you are punished even if you give your best and others do not. You are punished for trying, for craving something that at some points, only your teammates are able to stop you from getting. \n\n\nAm I a competetive player? Hell yes! Others? Not so much. When I lose a game, I jump into another and with what I observed - I mean, you know, where I fucked up - I try to be even better. Others? Not so much. When I call you names because you've been doing the same things over-and-over again like someone with no recent memories of himself getting brutally murdered and sent to the fountain as a handful of levitating jizz as your champion has passed out it's spirit, sort of like a *coup de grace* only to remind you, you've screwed things up.. I'm doing that to remind you - as you seem to have no recent memories -, not to offend your fragile peace. What you get from the things I say? That I offended you. You still forget that the last 5 times your died happen'd because of the same foolish mistake.\n\n\nI hate that I have to be competetive in an enviroment that supports people without this mindset. What can I do? I can get higher. Yes. But I need knowledge. Will it come with time? Yes. Would I find myself 2-3 divisions higher in an alternate universe where the only people who play ranked are willing to focus on the game, and - well yeah' - are competetive? Yes.\n\n\n**TL;DR: I love spaghetti.**\n\n\nEdit: edit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423920265", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Fookin' epic.\n\n**Best Post Award:** \"Alone.\" I mean, come on. It was out of left field and no one expected such an artistic representation of Viserys' inner demons.\n\n**Rookie of the Month Award:** Quill, definitely. His character is amazing and his dog is just... fantastic.\n\n**Character of the Month Award:** Alerie Tyrell. Her descent into madness was written *fantastically* and her new personality is absolutely incredible. \n\n**Quote of the Month:** \"Maybe you should fucking kneel. Come down here. *Kneel.*\" Come on, that was just awesome, and I could totally picture Valarr hissing \"*Kneel.*\"\n\n**Best Death 'Award':** Titus Celtigar. While there were some great deaths, all well described, Titus had the most balls or maybe he was the most stupid. Either way, first character killed by Drogon and definitely not the last.\n\n**The ‘Tent’ Award:** Harold Snow. Definitely.\n\n**Biggest Plot Twist:** Jasper receiving the legitimization letter at the Grand Council. Jasper in the Throne Room with Valarr was the second place moment for me, but the letter definitely changed the whole game. Even if it is forged. :)\n\n**Diabolical Award:** Leo '*Goddamn*' Tyrell. He sided with Lyonel for power as his Hand of the King, then when Lyonel retracted his claim he decided to call for Valarr for unknown reasons (I can't remember). And once the whole thing went down at the council, he declares himself as LP of the Reach and claims Alester was doing *unspeakable* things to Alysanne. Lying for power, siding with his families enemies, all just for power. What a *prick!*\n\n**Saddest Moment:** Definitely the aftermath of Gerion Lannister's death. With Alyssa Marbrand and Gerion both dying so close to each other and the Lannister children in such disarray, this definitely wins the cake.\n\n**Best Spy Attempt:** BUMBLEBERRIES!!!\n\n**Bro Award:** Lucion, for hugging Aethan at his sisters funeral. \n\n**ChaosIsALaddah Award:** Jasper Arryn for using his bastard son to gain more power and attempt to control the Iron Throne through Valarr.\n\n**OTP award:** Lucion x Maryen. The two are adorable together.\n\n**Most Dysfunctional Pair:** Valarr and Alysanne, holy fucking shit man.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423940574", "subreddit": "ITRPCommunity", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Sona is more dominant/sexual hungry/skilled than Diana? how so? isn't she calm, nobles, ionian-demecian good girl? Elise less skilled than Fiora? that's heresy.\n\nYeah, i'm definately gonna change Sona. Elise is so up and to the left because in her lore, she lures them in and kills them in her cave(?). Which is why because of that she sort of puts killing over sex.

Lux (similar as Kayle: lots of armor)? Zyra (imho DD)? \n\nDamn, I'm gonna change Diana to D/DD, I couldn't check the model because I had no internet for a good part of that chart. Part of the reason I decided to make this. Also, Irelia is DD because... Idek. I'll change that lmao. Vi was DD because in her basic splash and Officer splash they're pretty ample. Seju was E at one point (wtf I agree) but she's a big woman (muscular, broad shoulders(wut)) [you know what i mean] so I put her DD because of that and her old and new splash have pretty big sphericals. Syndra DD because, they're pretty big but i didn't give her much thought. I'll probably down her to D. Finally, Akali, she's DD because she used to have huge breasts in her older splash art, and in Nurse they're pretty big, and I just see it as they're too big for her small body and it's why she's bending all the time (lmao stupid, I know that's now why she's standing like that).\n\nKayle has huge breastplates (New base splash, battleborn, aether wing) so I went and put her in the average sized spot (most are D/DD cups in this game imo). Lux is at D because of Imperial, that skin's model has her chest popping and the splash art her pre crazy on the breasts too. Zyra should be higher now that I look at it.\n\n&gt;**Intercourse Tier:**\n\n&gt;it could awesome if you could separate ladies in BDSM category. example:\n\n&gt;Elise: SM, Eve: BD, Diana: DS, etc...\n\n&gt;dunno how Leona and Sivir fits in BDSM category... maybe Playful would be better dunno\n&gt;Nida and Shyv should be in BDSM as DS or BD\n\nI actually had it like that put I wanted to get it out Yesterday because it was Valentine's and thought it would fit. (I also uploaded like five new fanfictions/chapters that day too, wanted to go ham).\n\nElise was in SM and Eve was also in BD, (I think she should also slightly be in SM as well, just not as much as Elise). Diana would be DS, I agree.\n\nI put Leona in BDSM because she fits me as the BD type, because of all that CC lockdown. I put Sivir there too because I think she is is DS because of all her quotes and stuff.\n\nI really don't even know where I would put Nidalee, she does seems DS-ish and Shyvana seems DS herself. But I thought there was just too many in BDSM (my own fault, I generalized it too much, will definitely make a new one in the next week) and put them in better spots.\n\n&gt;**ass**\nwhy Riven have fat ass? shouldn't she be classified in athletic category? after all that jumping and swinging that big sword it's hard to believe she have big fat butt. Vi, Kayle and Akali also don't fit that category imho\n\nI used to have Riven at athletic but some people wanted her at fat (and fat doesn't generally mean 'fat', it's really just bigger than athletic, but you can have an athletic fat ass) because of Battebunny and I agree with that because it's the most popular Riven skin for sure.\n\nVi is there because in Officer and her base splash (in her base splash you can see it from the front o.o) it's pretty big (imo). It's hard to tell for Kayle so I just used which skin had the biggest one and that ended up being Aether Wing, booty game strong. Akali should be athletic, idk wtf I was thinking.\n\n&gt;**also Eve is OP's waifu**\n\nhaha, is it that easy to tell? I do think that she should be in those spots even if I wasn't so infatuated with her but, yeah\n\n**Eve is my waifu.**\n\nThanks for your comment! This is exactly the criticism I need to make the chart bigger, I'll be making a v2 and introduce the BD, DS, SM Tiers and fix around some champion positions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424015256", "subreddit": "Rule34LoL", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Gerion's \"Successful\" Journey**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Gerion**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*Weeks... Had it really only been weeks?*\n\n\nIt could have been months or years based on how it felt to Gerion Lannister and his crew. Although he knew he only had supplies on board for a single month, *A Month* but here they were with their supplies running out, and still no clue for Brightroar's location. They continued to sail, through the stinking, smoking seas of old Valyria. The air reeked of death and rot, but they had grown used to that after only a few days. What they had not grown used to was the slow progress through the Sea. Winds did not carry the ship in any direction the Captain wished to go and the few maps they had procured did not seem to correspond with the fewer landmarks they found.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhen he had arrived in Volantis only one month prior on Lannisport's *The Laughing Lion* his hopes were high. Gerion had always liked the name of the warship, it was named after his father and despite what his brothers had done to improve his family's station he felt like Tytos' only true son. The Lannister's were always men of power yes, but they were also men of charm. Despite Tywin and the other brother's focus on the power Gerion had never forgotten about Lann the Clever's charm. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat he did not like was the desertion of his crew, sure he expected a few of the conscripts to take to the free cities and try their luck. But upon Gerion's investigation and discovery of King Tommen's decision to sail into Valyria more of his experienced sailors left too. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\"You wan' me ta sail inta tha fookin' smokin' sea?\" \"Are ya fuckin' crazy\" \"Aye, that be a cursed place\" \"Best of luck to ya\"\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOne by one his lieutenants gave one answer or another and melted into the harbors of Volantis. He could curse them and make toothless threats all he wanted but he knew better. These sailors had no families, no allegiance, they could make a living anywhere and they knew it. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*But slaves cannot*\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe majority of the wealth Gerion brought on the voyage was spent on hiring a new crew. The slaves were hardly sailors but they could row and for the most part, that is all they needed to do. Gerion and his closest lieutenants who had not deserted could manage all the aspects of navigating, or at least that is what they thought.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\"Navigating\" if you could call it that in the Smoking Sea was more a guessing game fraught with danger. Jagged, razor rocks rose from unseen spires below the water and islands with their respective shallows sprung from seemingly nowhere in the fogs. Each of these islands once successfully avoided would soon then be explored by small rowboats. Dozens of islands were searched and nowhere was the remains of King Tommen's golden fleet found. Abandoned stone towers of oily black stone, the melted and destroyed walls of holds both greater than Harrenhal and smaller than Darry were found amongst some of these rocks.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut no life could be found on the smoking islands, no trace of anyone or anything treading them for hundreds of years. The sailors had stopped saying their various prayers to their various gods and soon began to realize what Gerion thought all along. \"There is no curse here, just sailors tales and superstitions\" \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThat was until they reached their final crates of supplies. \"We must go back my lord\" one of his original sailors from the West told him \"If we stay another week we will never make it back to Volantis\" another asserted. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*Weak cowards. There are no lions on this ship save me. I will return my families sword and I will bring the glory that Tywin and Kevan and Tygett never could*\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThree times had Tywin offered enormous sums of gold to lesser families in Westeros, and three times he had failed. Despite the ruin of some families, they would see their children starve before giving the Lannister's their sword. \"I will succeed where they failed\" Gerion had said repeatedly to himself. \"Financial and military prowess are only so much if you cannot obtain that which you truly desire\" \n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut, here he was. At the end of his trail. The final island they would be able to explore rose above them like a monolith from the sea.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Sir we must turn back and leave this graveyard before it claims us\" said his first mate. \"We cannot stay here\" \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe words rang through him like a church bell.\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n*We cannot stay here*\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe rowboat was dispatched to the base of the tower and Gerion was sitting at the prow. His men rowed nervously while his experienced sailors held *The Laughing Lion* for him. They circled the tower until they discovered what appeared to be a door above the water and moored next to it. Gerion used a metal wedge and a few of his men to pry the door open and lifted himself into the long abandoned tower.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nThe darkness from the towers interior seemed unending even when illuminated by the few torches Gerion brought onboard. The slaves began their foreign prayers again as Gerion hoisted himself into the tower and started his exploration. He continued into the darkness while his oarsmen continued their murmurs and prayers from the dingy.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\"Come on ya bloody cowards\" Gerion roared back.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut he was not answered by his crew, instead he was answered by the sudden illumination of the entire tower. From unseen lights above suddenly Gerion saw where he was. The floor below was some form of dark volcanic stone, the same oily stone making up most of the ruins of Valyria. The walls were a pristine white marble though with seven columns circling the center of the room. There was a pedestal on the far wall from where Gerion entered and above it was an inscription. It was in a foreign language that Gerion could not read but he copied it onto the back of a map so he could translate it later. He turned to call his oarsmen but the door had closed.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nGerion ran up to the shut door and could hear the various tongues of his oarsmen through it. \"Help!\" He shouted \"I am still in here!\" He hoped they could hear him but he needed to find a way out. No matter how much he pushed the door it would not move an inch. He took a running start and threw his whole body into the massive stone door but only ended up harming his shoulder.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe turned back towards the dias that the inscription was above and approached it. As he moved closer what was on the pedestal came into view. A single black stone shaped like a... A dragon's egg.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nGerion was sure of it, perhaps he had not found Brightroar but this would make up for the entire trip failures. Stone Dragon's Eggs especially from Old Valyria would be worth a fortune, Tywin would be pleased with a profitable return despite Gerion's own feelings of failure. When he picked up the smooth heavy stone the lights dimmed to black almost immediately and his exit reopened. He carried the prize back to the boat where his crew fell in silent awe, the same awe that gripped *The Laughing Lion* when he returned there.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHe showed the copied inscription to one of his sailors he found it was a Valyrian phrase, but one he had never heard it before. It translated roughly to:\n\n\n\n*No Gods. No Kings. Only Man*\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut no one knew what it meant or its origins. It would be one of the mysteries from the journey that Gerion would take unsolved to his grave.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo be continued in Comment\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424026346", "subreddit": "IronThronePowers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Somewhere to Begin**\n\nHe had no need for chains. As much as I struggled to escape, my hands did not move and my legs did not stir. He pulled down my trousers, a rough hand scraping my skin. And then it began. The world flashed before me, a dazzling array of lights, as the brazier erupted into flames. I could feel its heat nip at me. My eyes never left the fire; how could they? His hand was back, pulling at my manhood. His chanting grew louder, into shrieks of madness and fury as far as I could tell. I felt the blade press against me. The world exploded once more and though the icy pain flashed through my body, I could not move but lay reclined and suffer. His hand followed through the motion. Racked with agony, I watched as he approached the fire, his unnatural words screeching to the heavens, or hell as it must have been. He raised his hand, in it clasped the dripping remains of my stones and staff. Into the brazier it went. I could not help but watch as it was consumed, curling black as the fire threw shadows against the walls. The sorcerer’s speech crescendoed until he suddenly dropped silent. And then the voice came.\n\nThe blood was still trickling from my thighs as I lay on those stone cold steps. Myr was supposed to be our last stop for a while, the master having tired of constant travel. The red door was shut behind me, expelling me from my servile existence for the mere price of my manhood. I let out a cold, wheezing laugh. The voice, freshly imprinted, rang in my ears, chilled my very soul. The warmth of the fire had turned my blood to ice. \n\nThe door snapped open for a moment. I heard a derisive sneer followed by the faint clattering of metal next to me. The door slammed shut. Glancing at the object, I turned over and retched out what little content I had in my stomach to begin with. The frozen blade glittered with specks of my blood. Gingerly, I held at the handle. The sickle was a dark black, even under the color of night. I ran my finger along its edge where it had cut me. I shivered. A trail of blood welled up where I had ran my thumb. I sucked at it, examining the blade further, while my stomach still churned. The handle was of a twisted gold that shimmered like mist in the moon's light. Such a beautiful tool for a terrible purpose.\n\nHe had thought to take my life, leave me to suffer and die. My hand tightened around the handle. Such men sought to control others, through coin or otherworldly powers. Such men fought to be lords and kings. I winced as I stood, one hand clamped down on the bits that remained beneath to perhaps staunch the bleeding while the other clamped onto the sickle.\n\nI looked up at the stars whose light now shone a little less. But the great darkness had passed. Despite all they had done, all they had taken, I would live to spite them. I grimaced, using the walls to support myself as I limped along. The heavenly smell of bread steamed through the winter air. The baker's back was turned, surely he wouldn't notice a single loaf missing? As he stepped into the back of the shop, I ran out from the shadows, using my blood soaked hand to grab one of the puffy, round loaves. \n\n\"BOY!\" \n\nMy head snapped up, locking eyes with the baker, tired gray ones meeting fierce greens. \"M'lord, ser,\" I stumbled, backing away, though still holding onto the loaf. \"I beg of you, I'm hurt.\" The tears came unwillingly, for which I later cursed myself, at the remembrance of the voice of the fire. \n\n\"Then it don't look like ye be needing this here bread, do you, boy?\" He grabbed at me, forcing it out of my grasp. Sadly for his majestic pastry, it was soaked in the crimson of my blood. \"Fookin wasted,\" he spat at me, marking my cheek. \"What you have there?\" His eyes glanced around my body, latching onto the blade in my hand. \"Give it here, looks like good steel you owe me for ruining this here bread. Probably not even yours, is it you thief?\" Once more his grubby hands stretched out, groping at my weak arms as they fumbled for the sickle.\n\nI squirmed in his arms, fought his crushing embrace for a lifetime before I recognized the silence. In our brawl, the blade had wormed its way into his chest, carving a path for the entrails to fall out. I dropped his body, dry heaving overtop it. The loaf still lay on the ground, dirtied but edible, as far as my eyes could tell. The baker wore a sack, which after emptying I filled with the rest of his wares. It was a cold wet night, I wasn't about to become wasteful in my hurry.\n\n\"Where to?\" I wondered aloud, as my feet trudged along the cobbled road.\n\n\"A place,\" a low voice answered me. \"Where little boys are no longer slaves.\" I whirled around, eyes squinted, darting through the darkness. \"Here I am, little one.\" He was in front of me, a heavyset man with broad shoulders and a thick black beard. He was cloaked in colors of every kind, more like to a peacock than a man. \"Braavos or Pentos. Though I daresay by bared foot neither are acceptable.\" His voice rumbled like thunder, a comforting sound in the chill of the night. \"I have need for little ones like you.\"\n\nMy hand tightened once more around the handle of the sickle. \n\n\"To stand on corners and beg, to seek out those things that those who have hidden do not wish to be found, to find place in a brothel. What you make, you can keep. You shall be no slave, though I expect what words, what secrets you hear, you will share with me.\" He held out his hand toward me. \"Do we have a deal, little boy?\"\n\nI looked at his proffered hand, then back up at him. My grip on the sickle loosened. I had spent a lifetime as a mummer’s apprentice. One show had just ended and it seemed another was about to begin. I reached out and clasped his arm, “We do.”\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424039504", "subreddit": "IronThronePowers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

At the very least a large scale mass shooting! Your country needs you more than ever before. \n\n**Michael** You have my full cooperation.

Can someone tell me where the remote is?! \n\n**Narrator** - Had she been able to find it, she would have been able to turn to Fox News conveniently telling about reports of possible North Korean Arms Dealing being distributed to gangs in Detroit. She would not, and instead decided to go out to lunch.\n\nMichael Walked slowly and carefully inside the building ready for anything. He walked through the brick wall demolished recently by Gob and through a second hole this one with a noticeable pile of ruble beside it. Michael discovered a large wharehouse made into what looked like a factory. \n\n**Buster** Hey Brother.\n\n**Michael** Buster! You're okay!\n\n**Gob** (keeled over clenching his stomach) what about me? \n\n**Michael** what happened.\n\n**Narrator**- While Gob and buster where demolishing brick walls Gob exposed a secret factory in the buildings walls.\n\n**Gob** (Calling Michael) Mike it's me you gotta help me. I was breaking away some of the brick walling and suddenly I found this factory with Koreans in it everywhere!\n\n*Buster notices a large supply of prosthetics on an assembly line*\n\n**Buster** They're Heavily Armed! \n\n**Narrator** Unbeknownst to anyone these were North Korean Defectors who had escaped the brutal Prison camps. They had fled illegally to the United States and to make ends meet established a prosthesis factory to both repair their Harsh injuries suffered at the hands of a brutal dictatorship and start a productive capitalist life. Gob and Buster having discovered their secret operation meant the risk of their deportation. None of this could be heard by the NSA of course as shortly after Michael entered.\n\n**Eves** I can't get anything! something is jamming the radio. \n\n**Hay Gent** Keep Trying. It's an old building Maybe all that lead painting is interfering. \n\n**Buster** And that's why we can't leave. They are afraid we will call immigration. \n\n**Michael** Well why is Gob riving in pain?\n\n**Earlier**\n\nAfter more rubble collapses from the wall a brick landed on Gob's hand and crushed the phone he was subsequently holding.\n\n**Narrator** This caused Gob a great deal of pain. But this was not why Gob was on the floor. \n\n**Gob** (crying in pain mumbling gibberish)\n\n**Narrator** What seemed like Gibberish to Gob was by a staggering coincidence a fluent string of Korean insults. This led to understandably some aggression to Gob from the offended Korean workers.\n\n**Michael** Well that's Understandable but we need to go right now Im sure we can resolve all of this but I need us to get out of here right now. There are some people waiting outside who are have got the wrong idea what's going on about this and... How did this box get here?

Detroit is a dangerous place! I'm so greatful to see you in one peace! \n\n**Buster** It's okay Oscar. You're acting like you haven't seen me in years.\n\n**Oscar** In a way I haven't.

It was made illegal after it was found to cause serious burns, however George continued to market it in Mexico. It was also a device used to punish the Koreans who suffered within the brutal prison camps. The face of George Bluth was in fact literally burned within every poor prisoner who suffered from it's torturous use. \n\n*Back at the surveillance truck*\n\n**Eves Droppe** I'm finally picking up something!\n\n*noises of angry Koreans can be heard over the radio*\n\n**Hay Gent** Looks like things went bad. Arm the bomb for two minutes Lets get out of here before it blows! \n\n*they drive off. A flashing red light is seen on Michael's vest*\n\n\n**Michael** Okay we really need to get out now.\n\nSuddenly[ a grinding noise can be heard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1A6KES0CyA) A hacksaw is seen poking through the shipping crate box obscuring the brick hole in the wall. The crate opens and a blue painted aztek tomb is revealed. A door creaks open and out Leaps Tobias Funke who appears to have a very visible white powdered nose. Also following out from the seemingly tiny box appears both Crips and Bloods armed with handguns and rifles. \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VRBGRJ9PLM\n\n\n**Tobias** (with an alarmingly perfect british accent and very quickly) Ladies and gentleman Excuse my intrusion. I ... am the doctor and these are my faithful companions. Now forgive me I need to briefly catch up on the events of the forefront here and of the now. \n\n*tobias looks around the room wildly taking in the factory, the workers Michael and company*\n\n**Tobias** Hmm yes all right. Koreans working in secrecy repairing wounds and arms in this place How uplifting thats brilliant! Seriously bravo How does it work you'll have to tell me wait don't Im missing something. It's important and it's right in front of me. I know it. \n\n**Michael** Tobias\n\n**Tobias** Shh dont tell me and none of you lot either It's all coming together. I'm just distracted as to why you all are in such a hurry to fight in this wonderful world in which you orbit. I mean that's all I do it seems if figure out the why. Why are you fighting why you choose to do this bicker back and forth with each other. You lot over there with your guns and your drugs. What does it gain from you? Respect for your crew? what goods that? what of the respect for yourself? You happy with your division. I tell you wot makes me happy. Seeing you humans work it together. You're the only lot I'd bank everything on to bring this city out of the ashes. \n\n**Michael** Tobias \n\n**Tobias** Shush! And you lot. You look like you once had been beaten to your knees but yet you built yourself new legs! Why you hiding that?

{"body": "- Skip Shilin night market and go to someplace like Raohe nightmarket or even the Yonghe night market.  Shilin is dead and buried.\n\n- Go to Kending for a bit.  The night market is great, and you can drink cocktails as you go down the strip.  During the daytime, spend time at the beach, or rent scooters and visit the east coast, especially Jialewan. It's a great drive\n\n- Leave some free time in your plan to expand the night-clubbing.  If you and your friends are anything like my ABC friends who have done similar trips after finishing school, you will spend a lot of time at places like Luxy/Myst/Spark.  It's also worth checking out some of the latin bars/clubs if they are still around (anyone up to date on the bar scene?).  My (male) ABC friends couldn't get enough of the clubbing, because they were very successful with the ladies.  The female ABCs didn't have as much fun at the clubs.  Leave mornings free to work off hangovers or to locate absent members of your group.\n\n- March weather will be a mixed bag.  Some days will be cold, some will be hot, and some will be beautiful.  Expect rain at least 1-2 days.  In the south it will be mostly warm/hot and sunny.\n\n- Taichung and Tainan both have some great night markets that really put Taipei to shame.  In my opinion, real estate prices have killed night markets in Taipei.\n\n- Go to 100 kuai per dish re chao restaurants with a lot of people.  You buy fried dishes at 100NT each, and just grab beers out of the fridge as you need.  You can get full of delicious food and completely shithoused for a pittance if you want to.  Order some fried oysters, water spinach (空心菜) and also some kung pao chicken (宮保雞丁).\n\n- Go shrimp fishing in Shilin.  You can drink while you fish prawns out of a swimming pool, then cook them up.  It's open 24hr, so you can shoot the shit while you fish, then have some fookin prawns.\n\nProbably some other stuff too, i'll add if I can think of anything", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424063366", "subreddit": "taiwan", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This sounds like a WP post so fuck it...\n\nMy body jolts awake but my eyes stay firmly shut. Thoughts run through my mind in a haze. I hear voices... I think... or is that in my head? The floor is cold and unyielding. Its probably cement. \n\nMy eyes burn as I open them slowly to the white light. I dare not move my body as slight throbs pound through my feet and snake their way to the back of my neck. The light begins to focus in my sight. I see grey. Grey floors, grey walls and a cracked grey ceiling pressing down on my mind as my eyes slowly scan upwards.\n\nI move my arm inch by inch, wincing at the cold pain of spent muscle. Finally I press my hand into the floor and lift myself up. My thoughts start running away from me again, blurring my eyesight into a nauseous spinning fuzz. \n\n*Oy stand up you prick*\n\nWhat the hell? That was in my head.\n\n*What? You can't hear mey? I'm in your fooking 'ead mate*\n\n\"I'm up, I'm up.\"\n\n*Just take it easy there pardner no need to be in a rush cause 'a this british feller*\n\n*The fook you calling bri'ish mate? I'm arrish you fooking redneck*\n\n\"Shut up! Where the fuck am I?\"\n\n*Now ye can't go telling us t' shut up and then expect t' tell ye where the fook ye are now can ye?*\n\n*Stop being a smartass and tell him already you fucking ass*\n\n*All I can tell ye is that yer in 'ere wit us. Thing is where 'ere is don't make no fooking sense*\n\nI rubbed my head of the fog that was the irishmans voice. I looked around the room for an exit. Some way to leave, but, there was no door. The other odd thing was there was no light source. It was if the light was brought in but once it was here the source left but the energy had no where to escape so here it stayed iluminating my madness as these voices taunted me. \n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n*The fook you talking bout?*\n\n\"I can't see you, but I can fucking here you thats what the, FOOK, I mean\"\n\n*You just had to go there with the accent didn't ya? FINE. You want to know where I am?*\n\n*Don't do this to him*\n\nThat other voice worried me.\n\nAll of a sudden a desk appeared in the room as I turned around. It wasn't there before but I figured more important things were going on.\n\n*I'm right here* In a chair at the desk he sat... or I sat... I'm not sure... *I'm here* he stood behind me placing a hand across my chest *I'm EVERYWHERE!* The voice split my head like a coconut from a ten story building.\n\nHe appeared right in front of me and stared into my eyes.\n\n*You really don't know do ya?*\n\nI stared back, not willing to yield.\n\n*We're in yer fooking 'ead mate.*\n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\n*Don't git yer knickers in a twist. Ye can get out.... eventually.*\n\nHe looked even deeper at me and said\n\n*Well shit mate, I figured you hit yer 'ead hard enough to end up 'ere wit us. I didn't think you'd ferget yer name*\n\nWhat the fuck? How the hell did he figure that out? \n\n*I'm you ye fuck. I know exactly what your thinking*\n\nThe fucker can read my thoughts?\n\n*Yes. And while its a fun li'ole parlor trick it gits old pri'y quick*\n\n\"Fine then whats my name?\"\n\n*Oh that's no fun. We barely ever get t' talk t' ye, and if ye find out too soon. Hick here won't git 'is fun.\"\n\n\"Oh and who the fuck is he? Another me here just to piss me off?\"\n\n*No... 'e's not you like I am you. But fook that talk. We need to give ye a new name. 'Ow bout, Daimon? No? Jarvis? No? Damn I was 'oping ye'd be my robo butler.... Oi! I got it. 'Ow bout Mitch? Yeah! I now dub thee Mitch of the grey and dreary fooking room.

The security guard, a tall, well-built but peaceful-sounding Nigerian, had never before seen Mr Gray on TV or in real life. \n  \n  \nHe asked me, \"Do you know this man?\" to which I replied \"Well.... I don't know him personally. I think we should get back up.\" \n  \n  \nSo within a few minutes, a dozen guards come sweeping past us in pursuit of Andy Gray, who had to show his pass to them before being allowed into the studio.

{"body": "Do other broad classifications of genre (e.g. mystery, romance, historical etc) have similar proliferations of sub-genre?\n\nI appreciate that you have tried to list defining elements in your categories, but in general use, these sub genre classifications seem incredibly subjective and almost entirely dependent on some type of relation to one successful or popular progenitor title rather than the slew of similar titles.  High fantasy is mainly Lord of the Rings plus its imitators.  Grimdark is based on the success of GRRM and the type of books that have been picked up for marketing in the wake of its success.  Urban fantasy was spawned by Anita Blake. And so on.\nBut this doesn't really tell you much about the book that the sub genre is being applied to, in my opinion.  Perhaps other than a shorthand way of saying, 'If you liked X you might like Y'.\n\nRather than declaring something is a sub sub genre (think fantasy hipster nerds out there who will only read 'gothic steampunk urban fantasy' ... you wot m8?) and then spending hours explaining what that means, isn't it simpler to list the elements that the book contains?

While the HH only needs a single buff which it can play before combat and lasts for a whopping 5 minutes, the IG needs to collect all its buffs to be pretty good all the while actually fighting the thing and also only lasts 1 minute.\n\nIt's mobility is about equal to the HH. The HH has faster ground speed (when both weapons have their respective speed buffs, the HH does have a lot less without it but then again when is the HH not buffed up), while the IG can jump which when it has the white buff might as well remove the hunter from the battlefield for 2 seconds it's just such a useful escape tool. Their rolling ability is about equal, the HH may have a slight advantage but it's too close to really give that the benefit of the doubt.\n\nDisclaimer is of course that the Insect Glaive is an incredibly difficult weapon to actually use right at all.

{"body": "With Protoss, I would argue that following a set build order is more important than with the other races. The units are really expensive so building even one unnecessary gateway unit can really delay how fast you can get the units you really need, such as a colossus which can sometimes even cost you a game. For example, if a terran goes for a quick stim push or something, I can just barely squeeze out a colossi in time to hold it no problem but if I had made more than say 3-4 stalkers earlier, the colossus will be too late and I will take some nasty damage. \n\n\nIn terms of gas management, it is all about getting the big units (colossi, templar, etc) as fast as possible by cutting other units without dying. This is why it is common to see in a PvT, the protoss only have like 5-6 gateway units + 1 colossus at ~9minutes. They cut building less useful units and rely on the MoCo to stay alive until colossi start popping. Once the money units are a part of the army, it becomes a game of protection. Your other gateway units are largely support to tank, create room for, and protect these important units.\n\nPvP is all about scouting and identifying what your opponent is doing and trying to create the better army comp. You only really need to expand when your opponent does, or when you are certain you can defend it.\n\n\nPvT is all about parrying the early pushes/drop harass while getting the big, gas units + upgrades and then retaking the initiative and becoming the aggressor.\n\n\nPvZ you have to be much more aggressive early on, trying to deny the 3rd/forcing units as much as you can. If you allow the zerg to just sit and drone up, you will die to the constant tech switches allowed by the huge bank they have built. Scouting constantly with hallucinations is also key to determining what the Zerg is going for and making the correct response. (Like I am talking sending one out every 45-60s if you have the energy)\n\n\n(Please note all this advice is in the context of standard, macro games. Protoss also has the ability to be really cheeky cunts with some of the early aggression / all ins / cheeses at our disposal \n\n\nHope this was helpful, I am not the most eloquent when it comes to putting my thoughts into words, so hopefully this made sense.

You made that up, unless you mean \"Guns have no effect on crime, negative or positive\", which is a different issue.\n\n&gt; John Lott's work has largely been disproven. \n\nAttacking the messenger who's showing cold hard data. This is not a religious debate, let's keep it that way.\n\n&gt;Compare two similar states with different gun laws and you'll see little difference in crime. In fact, states with more guns have more crime and gun injuries in many instances. \n\nVermont would like to say \"you wot mate?\". DC would probably agree with you, they can't admit that it's not working.\n\n Interestingly with all the guns and relaxed gun laws Vermont is on the bottom and DC, with it's super strict laws is on top of this table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state\\\n\nThis is in this universe, on planet Earth.\n\n\n&gt;Moreover, defensive gun use data indicates that most people defending themselves with a gun are committing crimes, refer to Kleck, he says it himself. \n\nDefensive gun use exists, in HUGE numbers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use and here /r/dgu for fresh examples of bubble/matrix shattering news on defensive gun use.\n\n&gt;What it will do is increase suicide and injury. \n\nThis is not unlike alcohol or marijuana prohibition propaganda. It's a wish, not even a prediction.\n\nGood thing is we have bunch of states that let their students(adults who already carry everywhere) carry guns that you **can not** use to support your claim. Why? Because nothing happened and nothing is continuing to do so.\n\nWe don't care people like Amanda Collins got raped, we don't care more people like her will be raped because we're afraid of guns.\n\nHere's some more on her and campus carry in general. \n\n**Warning**: Matrix will bend, bubbles wil burst: http://youtu.be/e2-HjB6h6bI\n\nDon't be like the horrible person who said \"statistics aren't on your side\" to a rape victim. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424832816", "subreddit": "politics", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's a Chinese fighting turkey. Bred for their razor sharp talons and aero dynamic rear ploomage, the Japanese fighting turkey was the secret weapon developed by the Koumintang army prior to the Chinese revolution as a planned attempt to fend off the Japanese in the coming sino-japaness war. It's a little known fact that during the Munkden incident it was actually the fault of an inexperienced Chinese officer who was talking shit to one of the trained Chinese fighting turkeys. The turkey yelled \"You Funkin Wot M8.?!?\" \"I'll show you, you writhy cunt!\" The turkey then proceeded to try and destroy a Japanese railway. The Chinese fighting turkey program also known as \"TNS7\" (turkey and stuffing seven, in honor of the first class of fighting turkeys that died bravely during an American espionage mission, also know as the thanksgiving massacre) was terminated following the outbreak of the Sino-japaness war as they proved to be too difficult to control and ineffective in conflict as the turkey failed even to effectively destroy the train track. Some stray members still roam the world seeking revenge. Some have gone mad and started attacking anyone they see. They pop up from time to time and wreak havoc.one things for sure though. This world is no longer any place for the Chinese fighting turkey. For goodness sake, it's 2015! A bird can't survive in this world on fighting spirit alone! You need business smarts! Sex appeal! Synergy!! They're a relic of the past now. And with the full on collapse of the Japanese military in the modern world they live without purpose, all they can do now is hate dead Chinese men and hope for a swift end.. it's too bad.. they could have been something.
