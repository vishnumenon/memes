Cheeky is a colloquialism with various meanings and applications that is quite hard to describe. It can mean being impromptu, under temptation or being cunning. For example if someone claims they went for a 'cheeky pint' it might mean they went for a quick beer without planning. If someone lays a 'cheeky bet' they probably put a few pounds on a bet with big odds but on an event they think has a good chance of happening. Also the bet was probably a last minute thing, with no real background analysis done, and was a case of feeling like 'meh, fuck it', without thinking the reasoning through.\n\n\nSaying that, I still don't know exactly what a 'cheeky' chat is but I am intrigued.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425297088", "subreddit": "r4r", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I asked *my* brother, who has a phd in psychology. He told me that yesterday, while he was drinking coffee with his best friend, Sigmund Freud, Bill Gates stormed into the coffee shop, demanded to know if eidetic memory exists and gave them a billion dollars each. My brother said that he read in a book that it didn't exist. Freud nodded and Gates, satisfied with the answer, left the coffee shop and posted this very TIL post on his alt account. He then messaged me on ICQ and I helped him install Ubuntu on all of his computers. However, he tried to install Internet Explorer and it didn't work, so he unfriended me on Facebook. But, and I swear this is true, Steve Jobs came back from the grave and hacked Mark Zuckerbergs' laptop, and made me the CEO of Comcast. Now, seeing as I am the US president already, I couldn't have this kind of negative publicity. So naturally I staged an assassination. Me, Snoop Dogg and Kim Jong Un flew over to China. Then, mid-route, me and Snoop put on parachutes and jumped out of the plane, leaving Kim behind. I then used smoke signals to signal Putin to blow up the plane. However, because eidetic memory doesn't exist and I don't have it (as my brother predicted from reading a book), I couldn't remember what signals to use. So instead, I accidentally wrote the script for The Interview in smoke, that Seth Rogen saw and pitched to Sony that very same day. Me and Snoop landed in my appartment, where we hung out and smoked weed. Then, I had sex with like a dozen playboy bunnies. All in all it turned out to be an average day.\n\nI swear on me mums grave that I'm not lying, the above really *did* happen, ghosts exist, tupac is alive, **anecdotal evidence is just as good as any other evidence**, and that I would never procrastinate on reddit when I have a paper to write.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425423549", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Thats a lot of busting nutz. A lot of potential drained out of them PIPES. \n\nLuckily, you're young bro! And good of you to start early! \n\nLook bro, what you need is a reason for why you want to do this. If its just for being better in the gym, or getting more girls- sss... I dunno man, some people thats enough motivation, but for most it needs to be more real, more deep. \n\nI'm positive you have something more real in you- so dig deep. The truth is, every time you bust a nut, something special, something strong leaves you - So if you can, keep it inside you, and let it radiate your every being. \n\nYo, but I applaud you for even trying man! Don't get so down on yourself - You saw the truth of it, and now you're determined to make a change. Everyone starts small, and very weak against the temptations of PMO. It definitely was for me - Couldn't last a day ... But every time I failed, It made me angry and felt so low... And I couldn't ignore it like I usually did. \n\nBefore I knew nofap, I would Fap and feel nothing... Didn't even regret it, or feel guilty... but at the same time, I felt the negative effects of it all day. However, once I KNEW the truth - that burden was greater than I could bear... After I bust a nut, I'd take that burden with me all day... \" Ahhh this is why I feel this bad... this is why I'm so lazy, so tired, so awkward, so weak...\" I couldn't ignore it anymore! I knew what was killing me, and yet I was still doing it!? \n\nI snapped out of it one day, went into the shower- and COLD SHOWER'Ed THAT BITTTTCH haha. It was me saying, enough is enough - and kicked that Nofap troll in the fookin arse.  \n\nThe first streak was 280 days. Amazing time man... \n-I got So cut man... did massive amounts of pull ups, and dips and push ups- and i'm into boxing and martial arts , and I got faster-speedy as fun haha.\n-Girls....NATURALLY wanted this D. Just drawn to me. For the first time in my life, I ignored texts, and ignored advances- feels good dude.\n-Definitely more energy. Every time the urge comes, it was a sign...It was go time. Think about it dude... When the urge comes its like your body saying \" I HAVE TONS OF ENERGY RIGHT NOW!!! USE ME!\". But instead you sit there a watch poor women forced to blow nasty std filled penises - and you bust ALL KINDDDDZZ of nuts. work out instead- it takes less energy than PMO. \n\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry bro, you're on the right track- Keep going, and look at the numbers I presented you. Those are ALLL KINNNNDZZZ of nuts you busting, and its really killing you every single day.Every week, and every year- and if you continue it will compound and compound- and it will definitely drain you of life, joy and peace.

{"body": "\"Yea, gold-selling happens now, but it's like legalizing drugs. Once everyone can get in on it it will get out of control.\"\n\nU wot m8?\n\nI'm gonna leave the non-sensical legalized-drugs-statement on the side for a minute, and focus on a simple fact: Other Games (Wildstar, GW2, d&amp;d:online for example) have similar systems in their games, and IT WORKS! Marvelously even. It brings something great to the game: a choice on how you want to pay for the time you play. Choice is always good. The more choices you have, the better.\nThe fact that Gold-Sellers will become less appealing is also a nice plus, because the Sellers mostly operate on stolen accounts. With the tokens, a good amount of Gold-Sellers will go out of Buiseness, which overall will lower the amount of Accounts getting stolen. \nThe Tokens are one of the better adfitions to the game as of recently, and I welcome them wholeheartedly.\n\nAnd to come back to that ridiculous metaphor with the drugs you made: Gold-Sellers are like Drug-Dealers on the street. The goods are likely overpriced or are bad in quality or even both. Also, you don't know if the Dealer is gonna fuck you over, you have to trust him, but you have no insurance that he's not just gonna knock you unconscious and run. Also, if you get caught with drugs, you will get punished by the government, maybe even go to jail. Not to mention you finance organized Crime. \n\nThe Tokens are like buying drugs in a store. The Government controls them and distributes them. Quality is a non-issue since they have a certain standard to meet. The price is influenced by the market and will ostly stay at a predicatble level, no sudden extra cost just because it's risky. Since the drugs are taxed, the Government will have more money to spend, and since it's legal, you won't get into trouble for having and using the drugs.\n\nThere are way more points to this debate but my post is already too long and i think you understand what im getting at. Tokens are a good thing. And they'll come. Deal with it.\n\nTl;Dr Tokens are great, legalize drugs. peace.\n\n(This post was written on mobile. Sorry for the shoddy formatting and errors in my post.

Unless you really like trading, and are good at it, it doesn't make sense to grind through so many matches.\n\nAlso, it seems like people on this sub talk about spending $50 like we're all on welfare. If you have the money, and chances are you do especially if you can afford a monitor, online gameplay, the time off to play, etc., it's not a big deal. Obviously the effects it takes on the market is a different story which even further pushes the need to buy coins, but I honestly am indifferent since my gameplay has not been negatively effected. \n\nLastly, this isn't necessarily to you, but the community as a whole complains about fucking everything. Oh no, people are using players ideal for this game-type! Can you believe that? They're abusing players who help them win! UNBELIEVABLE. DAE EASHIT? DAE Ibarbo? Can you guys believe that this FUCKING VIDEO GAMES ISN'T PERFECT? I mean how hard can it be to program FUCKING REAL LIFE PHYSICS into a video game? Jesus christ man.\n\nYou now know what FIFA entails, so if you continue to play it the only person you should be upset with is yourself. It's just a game dude. If you want to guarantee you get good players check out some cheap sites and get the players you/make the teams you want/etc.\n\nI hope this wasn't too ranty or mean.

{"body": "Talkin shit you cheeky cunt come fight me IRL you dirty commie i'll hook you in the gabber 1v1 Rust you bitch. What the fuck, you said a jackdaw is a crow, you little bitch here's the thing I remember when I would ask people to get an email address but they'd respond \"Who am I going to email? I don't know anyone with email! That's how I feel when I have spent my life programming computers, getting a CS degree and working in high level positions in fortune 500 companies. Now, does that make me special, I dunno. I found so many idiots who write bad code, don't understand software engineering, and whatnot. I started to realize You're a fucking troglodyte compared to me, kid. Don't fool yourself. Speaking of trying too hard... sheesh. Just speak naturally. Don't bust out the thesaurus and try to match my multisyllabic verbosity; you couldn't even keep up with me if I was concussed and on horse tranquilizers.\nAnywhoozles, I find it really hard not to be condescending to a person who can't seem to separate his rigid perception of his own morals from external ethical systems or the biological history of his species.\nYou're like 100% feels/ideals and 0% history/science right now.\n\nHEIL KAPPA 666 JET FUEL CAN'T MELT ALUMINUM FOIL ALLAHU SNACKBAR\n\nOn Wednesday a friend asked me \"Are you going to get your ashes\" I explained that I am \"Not-Religious\". She proceeded to tell me I was a bad parent because I am not raising my kids with religion. I told her \"Religion is child abuse\"\nI said This subreddit is a place to talk about meta cancer. Discussion can be both serious, comical, and anywhere in between. You can make serious posts calling out meta cancer or you can make posts where you mock meta cancer so that we can all laugh at these people and shame them in this subreddit. This sub isn't even two weeks old so you're going to see people using it in different ways. You're also going to see shitposting from metacancer in this sub and a lot of the users have been banned. Some use alts to troll and screw with subscribers. It's going to happen but will be dealt with better over time by the mods and subscribers. Right now, the upvote system will filter out good and bad posts and content. Over time the mods will start to mod a little tighter and start guiding the subreddit in a more clear direction. Right now, it's a free for all among posters and the hope is that the best posts rise to the top of the sub so that people can vote and try to establish the type of content they want to see here.\nOne thing needs to be clear among subscribers and that is I'm an atheist. I come from quite the religious upbringing, but I let go of it. My family and few select friends know, but other than that, it's kept secret. I actually play drums for my church. This was during some event where a friend and I went somewhere for something while our pastor had just begun preaching. My house was on the way back so we decided to stop and smoke right quick and head back because they had food there, haha. But I trouble no one about their religion. I used to be the kind of atheist who constantly brought it up, but that's because I had just converted and I was in that state of mind where I had just found this new way of life and I wanted to share it. Kind of like a Christian getting saved, or being born again. When I got \"saved\" I wanted to do the same thing and tell everyone about Jesus and bring him up in any kind of conversation, but eventually I got over it and just let people live and that's how I am now with my atheism. You call me delusional. You claim I'm in a cult. You're calling me one of those Bitcoin crazy people. To your eyes I may be. But I am not. I am NOT forcing anyone to BUY Bitcoins, HODL, all hail the decentralized system to bring down the banks!, NO. Just no. I was and am simply asking for help.\nIF YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP, JUST WALK AWAY. Next time a homeless guy genuinely asks for help, maybe you should lecture him on how he shouldn't have been that way in the first place. That should help him. Right? People like you think you are so smart, and you probably are, but too blind to see what really matters.\nAnd you called this project based on greed.\nCan I ask you where you got all that from?\nThis is what I sexually Identify as ... an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me \"Apache\" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me then fuck you and your rules. /u/skeen was not inactive, /u/skeen was active in every user that had the freedom to post here. /u/skeen was also very active on reddit, just under another name. Fuck you and your rules, you sounds like a fucking theist sucking the dick of your Almight Mods and Admins. So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to.\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said \"Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all.\" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment. To tell you the truth, I've never thought about it. I've never thought of me doing a whole lot that I would categorize as brave. Other people have said that what I do standing up to the establishment and speaking my piece of mind and not backing down as being something brave, but I don't think of it in that manner. So I don't have a good answer for that, but I appreciate it when people compliment me on sticking to my principles. If you downvote freedom of speech, you're basically like the nazis before they started killing. A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist\n”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”\nAt this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.\n”How old is this rock, pinhead?”\nThe arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”\n”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”\nThe professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!\nThe students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.\nThe professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.\nSemper Fi. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed.\nWait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels.  \n\nTLDR; Fuck you ╭∩╮( ͡° ل͟ ͡° )╭∩╮", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425669534", "subreddit": "MLPLounge", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I got one for you. I cant remember the background as to why I joined this quest but I ended up in a room with a group wanting to do apex seregios. No biggy, I've done this before, I can help these guys out since they have a lower rank than me; maybe I'll even get one of those L zenith wyvern gems! So the hunt starts and I cart at the 10 minute mark because I went off to heal.... but some guy ran over to me whilst the sere was doing his double swoop attack. Eh. No biggy. It happens. Still got 2 carts left and he should be nearly dead. So I run back to the new area Sere has flown to and he starts limping but goes back into apex mode...this is where the fun begins.\n\nThey try to capture it.\n\nI keep attacking it but they violently bash the ping option trying to signal a trap is set up and trying to tell me to stop attacking. Ok. Guess these people just dont know you can't cap monsters whilst they're in apex mode. After this trap we'll get back to killing it right? Wrong. They set 5 more traps. FIVE. One at a time. It went on for about 10 minutes waiting for Sere to drop to the floor and then walk into each trap. At this point I find it hilarious and just start sitting on the trap using the kickback gesture. No surprise the Sere is not amused by my cool cat antics and carts me again.\n\nSo once they finally run out of traps they return to attacking and within 20 seconds of attacking it dies. w00t. Well that was fun now I'll be able to tell these guys you cant cap when it's in apex mod- \"Nice double cart moron\"\n\nThat was the message waiting for me once I returned to the lobby. U wot m8? I ended up replying with \"Thanks!\" because maybe they were just being sarcastic; Let's bring in the benefit of the doubt you know?.....but then he replies with \"What do you and a football have in common?\" \n\n*Immediately kicked from lobby*\n\nI sat staring at my 3ds for about 5 seconds until I burst out laughing from their terrible joke, the whole situation and that I had both the last literal and metaphorical laugh.

{"body": "Screw this kind of SJW bullshit. I found a lot of the text highly racist. As a Chindian myself:\n\n&gt;Indian men who date Chinese women are desperate to assimilate. They instinctively realize the privilege of being Chinese, and unable to access it any other way, aspire to marry a Chinese woman. They do not have to experience racism as much when their wives’ Chinese privilege protects them, and it gives them access to opportunities that are usually reserved for Chinese people. They are effectively deracializing themselves.\n\nHey, thanks for insulting my dad and politicising my parents' relationship. How about, they are attracted to each other, instead of some illogical and unsubstantiated SJW-style accusation? People act as individuals, and they're actions aren't automatically along lines of sex/race/whatever.\n\n&gt;There are many people of mixed race in Singapore, especially a group of people in Singapore called ‘Chindians’, which is a term for people who are Indian and Chinese, and who can pass for Chinese and thus have access to Chinese privilege. People like ‘Chindians’ can effectively move between the worlds of oppressors and oppressed. It is really difficult for people who pass, because they are always fighting to have their entire identities validated.\n\nU wot m8, pure Chinese people automatically think I look Indian, pure Indian people automatically think I look Chinese. \n\nMy identity is human. Singaporean. Post-racial. But these SJW-types keep insisting that I'm some underprivileged PoC/Indian/otherised victim. Encouraging professional victim-hood over self-empowerment.\n\nHonestly, I don't think systemic Chinese privilege exists in Singapore. This isn't me excusing the occasional cases racism (which does exist), it's a call for us Singaporeans to keep up the good work.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425923633", "subreddit": "singapore", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I forgot about the book and watched the movies. \n\nFirst movie starts okay and goes on relatively well until Rivendel. After that, the cheese starts rolling in. Firstly with the way the goblin chase under the mountain is handled. Last 15-30 minutes (the thing with the trees and eagles) is mexican telenovella grade cliches. This shit is overflowing with cliches. It's so sugar-coated I almost got diabetes.\n\nSecond movie: it starts going well enough, but ends up not being great. The barrel scene. Like a clockwork, there has to be a fight. God this shit was awful. After the barrel scene, the cliches start rolling in big time, again. From Thorin being an asshole to how they managed to catch the key in the last possible moment. Did we really need Smaug pointlessly chase dwarves for half an hour? The only good thing this scene gave is enough video for someone to make a MLG remix [with Skrills, weed and Far Cry HUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOZUU3dekv4). There's nothing too notable about that, plus it turns out Smaug isn't a dragon by any standard, let alone Tolkien's. In the meanwhile, Legolass, his lass and the other half of the dwarven party play deadmatch on de_lake with orcs. The ending of the movie gets an award for the worst cliffhanger ever — a wyvern leaving towards the lake town and credits roll. \n\nThird movie starts with a metric ton of cheese and cliches. Yea son please stand here, I need to use you as a tripod because I can't quickscope for shit. I need to hardscope that wyvern with - I am not shitting you - the halves of my bow stuck in the pillars of the invincible wooden tower. **U FOOKIN WOT M8?**  Oh, and the plotholes. Why didn't the Horde just use their wyrms to drill through the mountain straight into the city? Where did the goats come from? Why does Legolas posses the power to control the sands of time? Why is this movie so ridiculous? Why do all attempts to invoke karma (mayor and Alfred) feel shallower than a puddle? Last battle between Thorin and Azog: are you for real? This is looney toons grade bullshit. I mean, fine for cartoons but... I really expected a movie to do... well, better.\n\nYou can forget the books all you want, The Hobbit movies are still mostly shit. Hell, even Dragonheart 3 is better than Battle of Five Armies (though purely by the virtue of being half as long).

{"body": "Cheeky elbows to the sides and feet on toes were just apart of the game when I was still playing football competitively. I was a wide defender/winger and whatever I could do to piss off the person I was attacking/defending I did. It got in the head and helped me play better. I'm a short guy but was pretty sturdy and solidly built and loved to go into tackles. I can openly admit I was a massive cunt but that was my role in the teams I played for. If someone was maliciously fouled I felt it was my duty to give that player their own back. I would always seek them out for the rest of the game and even if it took till the 90th minute or even the reverse fixture I'd give them a taste of their own medicine. This being said I never dove once. More to the point I never really fell over easy either, much to the disappointment of a few of my coaches. Over the years I missed a few clear penalty chances by not falling down but it just didn't feel right. It never did and it never will. \nStepping on toes, cheeky annoying elbows, pushes in the back, slurs about their gfs, etc are tolerable and a part of football. Diving is disgraceful and against the morals of the game. In my opinion players who dive should always be yellow carded and if it is deemed deliberate it should be retroactively dealt with and a player should receive a suspension.

It's a bit tricky to non Aussies when getting the 'mate' colloquially thrown in to conversation. Indeed it's most often used as a term of friendliness. For example, a guy walks into a shop in Australia and the shopkeeper might say 'G'day mate, what are you after?' Or similar.\nHowever, close friends often call each other the derogatory C word instead of mate (I know I do, albeit occasionally) and if a guy is giving you grief, you might tell him to 'Fuck off Mate.'\n**Finally, 'U wot m8' is distinctively English and specifically the 'Chav' type of person. The Aussie version is more along the lines of 'You wanna go mate?!?'**\nTry and say it with a scowl and as all one word, it makes sense to us.  \n\n \n\n\n&amp; Don't forget that the original \"U WOT M8\" meme was created with a picture of an English kid.. taken from a television program that airs in North West England.. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n*^^Reddit ^^- ^^Where ^^people ^^argue ^^about ^^absolutely ^^nothing*\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426035141", "subreddit": "fightporn", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Let's ignore the other 83% of people and give preferential treatment to these guys, whose language and ethnic history is the most separated from the other people living there! \n\nOhohoho, Hungary, like many other countries (like germany) liked to play the forcible assimilation game, which meant that minorities, like slovaks, ruthenians, jews and orthodox were discriminated against either in education, politics or employment etc. as opposed to CSR which constitutionally awarded many rights to their minorities And you're saying \"Hungary should keep that land and continue to oppress minorities, because I am continually underestimating them and like giving them preferential treatment.\"\n\nRuthenians may have wanted to do that but There was no country around them that wanted to support them considering any country that would would have to A. go to war with Poland and B. Go to war with the RSFSR, which would require these nations to recognize the RSFSR, something that they vehemently opposed.\n\nYou wot? German support is completely irrelevant. Hungary expressed its will to conquer territories that it had expressly agreed don't belong to it. Furthermore Germany didn't do any fighting for Hungary to in the occupation of that Romanian land (they mediated a treaty while Hungary invaded and occupied). And if you want an Example where Germany stayed completely out of It and Hungary unilaterally invaded and was successful, then you have [The Hungarian Slovak War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak%E2%80%93Hungarian_War)  which violated even Germany's treaties with Slovakia, meaning that war was completely orchestrated why Hungary.\n\nSo take your Hungarian pity party and stick a pipe in it. Because Hungary is more guilty of war crimes than most other countries. And all your arguments of fairness and Hungary's perceived military incompetence are outright fabrications, as any history book can plainly show their expansionist, jingoist tendencies, their oppression of minorities, and their willingness to commit men to wars that the country lied about not wanting to do.

{"body": "*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***ponce***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ponce) : \n\n---\n\n&gt;Term originated in the UK and came to prominence in the 1960's, initially to describe a pimp.  In Spanish it means \"prince\" and could have either been referring to the fancy, over-the-top clothing and jewelry popular with pimps, or because he was surrounded by a harem of women, involved in the underworld, but usually not the actual \"king\" of the area (he had to pay tribute to use the block or neighborhood).\n\n\n\n&gt;Now it is generally used to refer to someone (usually a male) who dresses in nicer clothing and acts in a polished fashion; often interchangable with [fag](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fag) or [pussy](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pussy), but not necessarily as derogatory: a ponce is not necessarily homosexual, nor are they necessarily passive or weak, but they would tend to be thought of as [metrosexual](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=metrosexual) or [gay](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gay) in their manner of dress.\n\n\n\n&gt;In the US it also takes a bit of a tone for a [poser](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=poser) or [wannabe](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wannabe), primarily in the punk, ska, or artsy scenes.\n\n\n---\n\n_1960's BRITISH:_\n\n_JACK: Oi, I need to find me a classy bird for the night._\n\n_TOM: Go talk to that ponce Tony.  He got some nice girls, by the hour, they are._\n\n_JACK: Tony's a ponce, is that right?  I though he just had some sort of magic with the ladies._\n\n_TOM: Fuckin' prat, you are._\n\n\n\n_MODERN BRITISH:_\n\n\n\n_NIGEL:  I can't believe I got curry on me new Pradas!  I just paid five hundred quid for em!_\n\n_ANDY: Haha, you fuckin' ponce, that's what you get._\n\n_NIGEL: Fuck you, you fookin' chav, at least me Burberry's real._\n\n_ANDY: Right.  You're still a ponce._\n\n\n\n_MODERN US:_\n\n_DAVE: Hey man, wanna come into the woods with us and [blaze](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blaze)?_\n\n_FRED: No thanks, dude.  I've got a date tonight and I don't wanna get my jeans dirty or sound like a retard when I'm talking to her._\n\n_DAVE: Quit being a fucking ponce and come on, man.

{"body": "These are my personal unpopular opinions...\n\nI like most of the show changes.\n\nI like show Shae and her story with Tyrion vs book Shae and her relationship with Tyrion.\n\nI like how it remains very grey with whether or not Stannis is a \"good\" in the show and I like how it is revealed that Stannis is under a spell of sorts with Mel.  \n\nI like that the show has dropped the LSH subplot.  Cat should have stayed dead in the books as she does in the show, it makes the Red Wedding that much more dramatic.  Bringing Cat back, even partially, so she can seek vengeance cheapens the red wedding.  \n\nI like the creation of Karl \"the fooking Legend\" Tanner.\n\nI like that the show hasn't killed Balon off yet.  It shows that Mel isn't flawless, I imagine next season Davos is going to point that out which will inspire Stannis to leave the wall without his red priestess.  \n\nI like that D&amp;D are streamlining the story and removing unnecessary subplots like the Ironborn!  I care about the song of ice and fire, not how the iron born fortuitously attack the reach just as Aegon lands thus allowing Aegon to sack Kings Landing before getting obliterated by Dany's dragons.\n\nI prefer the show Daario over the book Daario.  Show Daario is simply more entertaining, serious and relate-able while book Daario is a ridiculous looking clown.    \n\nAnd lastly.. and most controversially.....   I like the wright attack at the end of season 4.  It is the most fantastical of the series but we are at the point in the series now where we are going to see more fantasy elements.  And frankly the mesh of CGI with cosmetics was pretty impressive and seamless.  \n\nThings I don't like \n\nI don't like getting rid of young griff and griff.  That added a lot of history to the events.  I understand why he gets cut, the show is streamlining, but there would be great drama to watch Dany kill the last remaining relative she has because she views him as a traitor (despite having a better claim than her).  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426265644", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

Now mainstream wants nothing to do with them and even the ivory towers of academia are starting to pull support.  Even their home publications are feeling the pressure of needing to move on, which simply wont be done while the ideologues remain.\n\nOn top of that they are allowing the concepts of these ideologues to be drug out into the light, where as before they would hit a culture quickly, embed themselves, eat the community from the inside, and move on before anyone was aware there was a problem.  Our simple stubborn existence prevents them from subverting the culture and forces them to face the public with their ugly poorly thought out ideas, to which the public has responded with a hearty \"U WOT M8?\"\n\nThese people simply have bad ideas, poor behaviors, and no skills out side of manipulating people over twitter.

Rhinoceros could be biceratrhino / monoceratrhino or something weird (doesn't really work)\n\nBut this is just a latin / greek dichotomy (or partition in latin ;)) \n\nThe terms of theism have nothing to do with religion nor does it pretend, so to say they're wrong because \"you can be\" isn't right.\n\nWhat would be more of a stretch, and more in line with what you're saying, is anti-theist, which you could say is more anti-religion in sentiment and takes the atheism part for granted, but there are lots of theists who claim they are not \"religious\". And before you try and pull your move... no, by your logic that would make \"anti-theist\" someone who is against god, that isn't accurate, anti-theist is against religion. I am sure there are crazy religious people out there actually trying to kill god by killing kittens (satanists or something?), but you wouldn't say they are anti-theists would you. Sure, they are \"against god\" but terms take on more meaning and specialization than the sum of their parts. Anti-theist doesn't mean against god, it means against religion, so that would be more apt, but equally wrong, for you to talk about ;)\n\nThey are not equatable terms because of these two edge cases, so treat them separate and don't try and infer one from the other, so TL;DR atheist means \"not religious, I believe there is no god\" and \"anti-theist\" means \"fuck religion, there is no god\" and not \"there is a god, and fuck him, I'll 'ave 'im I swear on me mum, as in 'against god'\", **like \"anti-abortion\" people don't think babies are stupid and abortion doesn't exist.**\n\nTL;DR Language!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426430129", "subreddit": "religion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Fido stared at the computer screen, squinting slightly in its surprisingly bright glow. He wasn’t entirely sure how to spell the word “retard,” nor the words “fuck” and “you,” but had given it his best shot. “fuk u retord” stared back at him from the monitor, which seemed about right—at least phonetically. He slowly lowered his nose  to the enter button and, with a soft growl, lightly pushed it down. The computer immediately beeped with the same sound he’d heard countless times while his owner Jerry chatted with friends online. He looked back at the screen, the words “fuk u retord” now definitely visible to whomever sat on the other end of the computer.\n\n“u fokin wot m8?” replied the human on the other end almost immediately. It was DarkBlazer69[FaZe], the bastard with the audacity to insult his Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction. He’d spent roughly every evening for the past sixteen months typing up the short story with his snout while Jerry slept, posting his nightly sentences to his blog at www.IAmNotADogBlogging.com. It seemed to be getting some pretty good reviews thus far, given he’d received numerous poorly worded offers for low cost Prada bags and several messages regarding improving his search engine optimization. Yet DarkBlazer69[FaZe], his latest reader, only sought to insult his writings, to tear down all he worked for.\n\nReturning his snout to the keyboard, Fido resumed poking at the letters, typing out the words “ill fuking kil u” within a mere seven minutes. He knew he wasn’t the fastest typist, given how many errors he made and how long it took him to figure out the correct spelling, but his mind was sharp as a sharp thing. He could come up with insults on the spot, no doubt about it. He stared back up at the screen, proofread his text, and made a quick edit, changing the letter “u” to the word “yu.” He lowered his snout back to the keyboard, pecked at the enter key, and waited.\n\n“ur ded kid I swear on me mum,” replied DarkBlazer69[FaZe]. “Ur riting is shite.”\n\nFido growled softly. This kid had no idea who he was messing with. He was probably just some stupid ten-year-old using his father’s computer. That was it, he knew nothing about writing. Nothing about the intricacies of Sonic the Hedgehog fancifctions. He probably didn’t even know how to read and was just taking out his pain on Fido. He returned his face to the keyboard and resumed punching the letters with his nose:\n\n“im like 7 foot 14 and 250 hounds easy. ill rek ur shit up.” He re-read the sentence, then glanced over at Jerry. He was still asleep in his bed, his glasses and pocket protector resting on the nightstand beside his head. Fido returned to typing. “me n my frend jary r bodybuildors and humans. well fukin kill u.” He smacked the enter key with his nose.\n\n“im a 47 year old hacker and a professional MMA boxer, dogg,” DarkBlazer69[FaZe] wrote back. “I am an expert in gorilla warfare and have over 300 confirmed kills.”\n\nFido stared at the screen, his head tilted slightly and mouth agape. How did he figure out he was a dog? He glanced up at the webcam atop his monitor, then jumped off the chair. He had to have been watching him, he must have hacked into his computer. Fido had no idea he had been messing with a hacker gorilla, let alone one whom had previously murdered 300 people. He quickly closed out the window and turned off the computer. It was not worth losing his life over a silly argument on the internet, not even remotely. He could only hope that DarkBlazer69[FaZe] had not hacked his home address. To be safe, though, he’d simply take a break from the Sonic fanfiction until the heat died off. He had other projects he’d been working on, anyway. Perhaps it was the right time to resume the Harry Potter dog-human fanfiction he’d been working on at his other website, www.ImReallyNotABloggingDog.com.  \n\n_____________\n^If ^you ^enjoy ^my ^writing ^style, ^feel ^free ^to ^check ^out ^some ^of ^my ^other ^short ^stories [^in ^my ^subreddit!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChokingVictimWrites/)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426542698", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;The Killing Joke, an Alan Moore comic in which Barbara Gordon is visited by the Joker, assaulted, and paralyzed. \n\nHasn't the Joker just straight up killed like 3 Robins? What makes Batgirl so specia... oh, batGIRL. Mah B. B for bat.\n\n&gt;it is a widely held belief that the assault was sexual in nature\n\nIsn't the Joker kind of Asexual though? I mean, he's got Harley fawning over him, and god knows, I'd put it in that crazy, just to regret it later.\n\n&gt;The book has been the subject of feminist critique, criticizing the treatment of Barbara Gordon.\n\nHas there been any critique, especially by feminists, of the times Robin has died? I'm assuming not. Sounds like asking for special privilege, for a fictional comic book character, due to their also fictional gender.\n\n&gt;Jeffrey A. Brown, author of Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture (2011), noted The Killing Joke as an example of the \"inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry\" in light of the \"relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.\"[28]\n\nThey kill Robin. More than once. U Wot M8?\n\n&gt;While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while \"women on the other hand, are more likely to be casually, but irreparably, wounded such as when Barbara Gordon's (the original Batgirl) spine was shattered by the Joker just for fun and has been restricted to a wheelchair for over a decade now.\"[28]\n\nThey also broke Batman's back, yea? Also, she might be in a wheelchair, but she's still ALIVE. They just got new Robins. He was replaceable like that, apparently.\n\n&gt;Like is it not the most obvious fucking thing that an ideal Joker variant for a Batgirl cover is BATGIRL TRIUMPHANT, joker irrelevant?\n\nWell...\n\n1. the Joker is Batman's nemesis.\n\n2. Batman is like a top tier hero, and he can't beat the Joker.\n\n3. Why should Batgirl be triumphant over the Joker when even Batman can't beat him?\n\n4. What does this say about the Joker, as a character, that he's able to be bested by the equivalent to Robin, where the Joker kills Robin more than once? How scary is the Joker if other people can beat him, yet Batman struggles with it?\n\nNow I'm not saying Batman doesn't 'beat' the Joker, or that Batgirl couldn't win a fight, and lose the war, so to speak, but the character of the Joker is suppose to be scary, imposing, evil, and top tier. He's a fuckin' badass. Why in the hell would Batgirl beat the guy that Batman struggles to best? It just seems like, in the mythos, its probably asking for special privilege when Batgirl can beat the Joker, but Robin ends up dead at his hands, more than once.\n\n&gt;Of course, there's still more covers to be revealed, so perhaps we'll see a rapey cover featuring the Joker and Green Lantern or Sinestro... but somehow I doubt it.\n\nComic books are likely a reflection of our society, and in our society, we have a narrative that says only men rape women. Instead of thinking about this as the comic book saying something to society, I think we might want to consider what society is telling this comic book.\n\n&gt;it has been 0 days since DC Comics did something stupid.\n\n'Because I disagree with their choices, and my opinion is the objective standard for them having done something stupid or not.'\n\nEdit: Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the Joker also mentally torture one Robin to the point of him going insane and becoming like a mini-me Joker?

I'm telling you that so that as I proceed to shit on your argument you understand that I'm not an asshole, just upset. \n\nFirst off, \"the crucible isn't balanced\" is a horribly inaccurate statement. A level 10 can hop on the game and be destroying 32's just about as fast as they're getting destroyed. Why? Because all weapons are balanced. The armor is balanced. The entire crucible is setup to work for everyone. \n\nOkay okay okay. What about different weapon types? That's a big one! \"Shotguns are too powerful\", \"fusion rifles kill too easily\". Blah blah blah. Let's just be clear about one thing that far too many people overlook. IF YOUR CLOSE ENOUGH TO SOMEONE SO THAT THEY HIT YOU WOTH A SHOTGUN, YOU SHOULD DIE. It's really as simple as that. Same goes for fusion rifles. If your not good enough to watch your radar like a hawk and never sprint into a room where there are enemies, it's not the game killing you... It's you. \n\nAll you have to do is remain vigilant, keep your space from other guardians and always be Mindful of your weapon layout and preform your actions accordingly. Are blade dancer/nova Bomb/Titan smash/golden gun annoying? Yes. Are they a big deal? NO. Why? Because it works both ways. You get fucked by a bullshit super? Then use yours!

I wonder how much we'll see of the premier on this feed? Probably not much :(\n\nEdit 1: Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen Baratheon) was just talking about how awesome it was to marry Margery Tyrell. Can't say I disagree with him lol.\n\nEdit 2: Iwan Rheon (Ramsey Bolton) was interviewed. He didn't say much besides almost making a joke about how Alfie Allen has a bit of a thankless job.\n\nEdit 3: Hannah Murray (Gilly) says she didn't read any of the scripts besides her own scenes. Now that's discipline.\n\nEdit 4: Liam Cunningham (Davos) says if he says anything, he'll be kicked to death.....harsh, man.\n\nEdit 5: Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran Stark) isn't in this season. He says he hopes he doesn't come back in season six and be killed in the first episode.\n\nEdit 6: Roger Ashton-Griffiths (Mace Tyrell) has read all of the scripts of season five, but isn't spoiling anything. He is wearing a very Westerosi outfit though. Seems like a weird dude.\n\nEdit 7: Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy/Reek) says to expect a lot of deaths.\n\nEdit 8: Bah, so many interviews! Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark) and Ian Beattie (Meryn [fookin] Trant) hugged when they saw each other for the first time. Sophie is like an amazon woman. Nothing spoiled though.\n\nEdit 9: Mark Gatiss (Tycho Nestoris) is in the season. Kit Harrington (Jon Snew) says he had the biggest scene he's ever had to shoot this year. He says he can't say if Jon lives through the season.\n\nEdit 10: John Bradley (Samwell Tarly) had his interview invaded by Kit. Jonathon Pryce (High Sparrow) wants everyone to high-five him when you see him. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) says we're entering the \"end game.\" And the interviewer made an incest joke. Awkward.\n\nEdit 11: And its done. Damn. I was hoping we would get to see something of the premier.

{"body": "My grandfather had a dog when he lived in Ireland. Big ole Irish wolfhound named scruff. Now scruff was an amazing dog, he would walk my Grandfather to school, go home and then pick him up from school. He did this well into the autumn of his life. Now my grandfather was leaving high school on day and couldn't see scruff anywhere, not a big deal, some days the old gaffer would stay home. \n\nSo my grandfather began his walk home through the county lanes outside Dublin and had his head in the clouds as most sixteen year olds do. He was maybe ten minutes from home when he saw them. Six boys, older boys, seniors if you will, throwing rocks and hitting something hanging from a tree. Something big and grey. He moved closer and he found they had strung his beloved dog up. A wail like a banshee escaped his lips and he cut his dog down but it was very much so too late, scruff had died, his neck had broken when they strung him up. Now as my grandfather cradled his life long companion one of the older boys piped up \"be a fookin man, it's only a fookin dag\". When my grandfather tells this story he only says he saw red. \n\nOnce the dust settled, five of them were going to the hospital, one would lose an eye to a punch so powerful it broke his brow, the others  had various injuries including multiple broken bones. The last one, the one who had told him to be a man had run. He picked up his dog and carried him home. My great grandfather tried to bury scruff for his son but my grandfather insisted on doing it himself, when asked why by me, he looked at me with cold eyes and said \"I was being a man.\"  He was not a cold man, just hard, he had a very direct way of dealing with things. Soon after he left school and moved to Canada and joined the army, he did not set foot in Ireland for some forty years, when my great grandfather passed away. He oddly enough ran into the boy who had told him to be a man at the wake. He did not say hello or shake his hand, he simply looked at him and said \"Jim, if I had caught you that day I would have killed you, so leave this place now, because forty years later I might still  do it.\" He buried his father beside scruff on the ancestral land. \n\nSorry it's so long. But moral of the story, a pet is more than an animal it is a member of your family, your inner circle, never ever let someone else take their fate into their hands.

{"body": "&gt; So when corporations don't invest towards diversity, it's proof that there's no diversity problem, because corporations don't like wasting money\n\nU wot?  \n\n&gt; Man, it's almost as if libertarians have already made up their minds that X doesn't exist, and will come up with contradictory explanations explaining their reasons for believing that.\n\nNo, but a lot of the \"evidence\" of gender discrimination is based on false information or misleading stats.  That is true whether you or I believe it or not.  It seems like people who believe in gender inequality have already made up their minds that it exists and will lie and skew statistics to explain it.  \n\n&gt; Yeah, and scientists are paid to be objective and go by numbers. And yet here's a study showing that when scientists are presented with identical resumes, they're far more willing to give male resumes a higher salary and acceptance rate compared to female resumes.\n\nGreat, but that's completely unrelated.  The branded/generic pharmaceuticals analogy is just not a good analogy.  If your sole job is to save money and you could save ~25% of SG&amp;A by just hiring women, you would.  Saving that much money would make you a rock star in the company.  But even without that, the $0.77 on the dollar myth for the same job is not true.  That it the blanket rate and is different because of career choices, paying women differently than men would be illegal.  \n\n&gt; Sure there is. Tens of thousands of years worth of religious and social conventions that put men one one type of role and women in another. I think that would have at least as much long term impact as a patent that expires in a matter of years.\n\nThe patent analogy is flat out a bad analogy.  Branded drugs just work way too differently to be compared the employment in gender.    I mean, I could compare the war in Iraq to computer sales, but that doesn't make it a good comparison.  Nothing changes the fact that the often cited statistic \"women earn $0.77 for every dollar a man earns for the same job,\" is false.

{"body": "\"I just watched Kingsman and sware on me mum I'll bash your head in, bruv, see if I won't.\"\n\nI eyed the cheeky runt up and down, flexing my knuckles so that tendons stood out like subdermal cigarettes on the backs of my hands. \n\n\"Pardon me?\" I said.\n\n\"You heard me, guvnah. Gimme your wallet.\"\n\nI weighed his threat. On one hand, he was shorter than me. On the other hand, he was carrying a bottle, so the threat of bashing my head in was not necessarily an idle one.\n\n\"I'm having trouble believing that this is a real mugging,\" I told him. \"In fact, I'm having trouble believing that this is real life.\"\n\n\"Alright, wanker, let's have at it, then,\" he said jubilantly, raising the bottle and advancing.\n\nI ducked under the first swing. As the bottle whistled over my head, my left fist plowed into his ribs. It was a sloppy punch -- I hadn't had time to curl my fingers in properly -- and it seemed to do as much damage to my wrist, twisting it back, as it did to his torso. Still, he was winded enough that I was able to shove him back, and we tumbled like an eight-limbed organism off the curb and into the rain-drenched street.\n\nThe bottle having flown off to parts unknown, we flailed at one another barehanded. As I grasped for hold, I found to my surprise that he was soft, like a newborn hippopotamus. His stringy muscles were coated in inches of fluffy fat, and I was quickly able to gain the upper hand. Squatting atop his chest, I pummeled his face with both hands until my knuckles smarted.\n\nWhen I felt the nose cartilage crunch beneath my right fist, I was overcome by the sweetest satisfaction of my life. To this day, I have never felt anything so powerful. It was as if, by breaking his nose, I'd opened the door to Heaven and secured not only my eternal salvation, but a place on the bowling team of Jesus Christ himself.\n\nShortly after his nose broke, the guy gave up all fight and began to sob. Exhausted as a marathon runner, I rolled off of him and stared at the stars. The pavement was cool and wet against my neck. For a moment I imagined I was lying on the wing of an airplane.\n\nBeside me, the mugger blubbered pitifully. I sat up and looked at him, splayed out, blood flowing out of his ruined nose.\n\nIt occurred to me that, of the two of us, he was the one who most closely resembled a mugging victim. With that thought, an unspeakable horror began to fill me, starting in my toes and working its way up to my throat, where it nestled and began to swell.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" I said, moving my hands over his face, afraid to touch him. \"Oh my God, are you okay?\"\n\nI got him up and led him to a bench. Once I had him sitting straight, I left him to his sobbing, and pounded on the door of the Wendy's down the street. They were only supposed to be open for drive-through customers at this hour, but I convinced them to let me in, and grabbed a huge stack of brown napkins.\n\n\"Call an ambulance, will you?\" I snapped at the younger one, whose eyes were wide as double quarter pounders over his goofy crimson uniform. Then I bolted out the door with my armful of napkins. As I ran, many of them escaped, caught by the wind, and floated down to leave a sodden trail behind me.\n\nBack at the bench, I mopped up his blood with the napkins, crumpling them up and flinging them away as each grew soaked.\n\n\"There, there,\" I said, mopping away, gentle and firm as a zookeeper calming an injured tiger. \"It's okay, bud.\"\n\nBy the time the ambulance arrived, the sobs had stopped, and the mugger had wrapped his flabby arms around me, trapping me there.\n\nLater, I found out that he'd had a mental issue, some complex or other. He'd hardly known what he was doing that night, was just riding some inexplicable high, and I'd beaten the spit right out of him.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the guilt faded. But the pain in my wrist lasted for months, and the feeling of his nose crunching beneath my fist -- that still comes back every once in a while, mostly after it rains.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426915888", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;This won't apply to any woman in the world. It's just the whole concept of picking the best possible mate. No one in the world wants second place when they could have first. \n\nFalse.  You never explain why higher status men are a better choice than lower status men.  Men don't always choose the woman with the highest social status.  In fact, men rarely choose that woman.  So why would you just suddenly conclude that higher status men are the \"better\" choice without further explanation.  \n\nWhat you are really saying is that women are naturally hypergamous.  Again, I can't say that for sure.  There may be some women who don't seek high status partners, just as men don't seek high status partners.  But, I do suspect that they would be rare.  \n\n&gt;I don't think people consciously think that way, if they even do. It's just that any weakness will be considered intrinsically inferior, and shortness happens to be one of them.\n\nWhat makes you think that being of shorter stature is a weakness?

I'm not even mad if you watch my clip, but people react like I shot Santa Claus.\n\nEdit after having watched. So I watched the entire thing, talking about how racing works =\\= salt. Nugi did a great job in a tough role, this is why you usually need two people chatting, its much easier but he did great just himself.\n\nAs an example Helman says \"I think the extra life early game makes it way too hard to compete.\"(as melee).\n\nI think people could argue this is salt, but really what it is is accurate truth of what this event was. The difference between Helman and myself, is I go the next step and say \"And thus I think this event was designed poorly, and here is why\".\n\nThere have been a LOT of \"designed poorly\" instead of \"well thought out\" in the last year with GGG. I'm sorry your impression is that I am only negative, but when I'm forced (and I want to be clear, I'm forced because I LOVE racing, just not where its been going) to play a game mode that is changing in ways that are mostly negative, I think it wastes everyone's time to blow sunshine up your ass.\n\nShort races = more rng = bad  \nboxes = more rng = bad. Boxes are not even fixed inside a FIXED race. I mean U WOT M8???????????    \nShrines = more rng = bad  \nHealth per level = no strategy in trees anymore, pick all DPS nodes = dumb  \nVendor RNG = Something completely out of your hand. How would a green gem + any amulet = Jade amulet break the game? Yet its still not there.  \nFixed seed races = no skill in knowledge of layouts. People who say there is no skill in this are people who have no knowledge about it. Look up the definition of the word \"skill\".  \nGuest monsters = horrible layout\\monster synergy + awful XP curves depending on what types you get. A squid is 35% of a golem, but you get 3 golems or 15 squids. One also takes 5 hits to kill vs 1.    \nComing Soon ** Bloodline idiocy = I get P Link or NecroV and you get all easy mod = I'm behind 3 blue packs and lose a close race, and all signature race records are close at the end of the season.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426983298", "subreddit": "pathofexile", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Kendrick's album didn't fall from the sky as an objectively great work of art. The fact that a lot of people are saying that the album is great does not mean that if I reject this \"greatness\", that I'm just \"wrong\". It means I don't agree with the consensus, but going as far as saying that I should broaden my tastes is just childish. And \"relatively objective\" makes 0 sense. This isn't science, this is music.

Babies Cry.\"\n\n-My old Differential Equations Professor Dr. Ladas  \n  \nReason that may make some sense is that it is nothing.  You can never have some of nothing only none of something.  Imagine apples.  I have 3/1 apples.  Eat 3.  Now I have 0/1 apples.  Now forget about apples and imagine having nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  I have 3/0 nothings.  At the same time I have 45/0 nothings.  \n  \nNow think about it in monopoly money.  I have 50 monopoly dollars.  In the real world I go to a store to buy something.  It is 50 dollars.  I hand them 50 monopoly dollars.  They look at me like \"u wot m8?\"  I try to make a deal and offer them 100 monopoly dollars.  Now he like \"dude wtf I got a job 2 do.\"  Now I say okay here is an offer you can't refuse.  I give him $2,000 monopoly dollars.  He looks at me and says \"do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around.\"  \n  \nThe moral of this story is that the monopoly money is essentially nothing.  Useless, worthless for the real world.

{"body": "u wot mate? \n\nXenophon has already covered this pretty well but this is a point that bears repeating: The Roman military did not enter into a period of decline after the death of Caesar. \n\nIt was after the death of Caesar, during the reign of his adopted heir Augustus that Rome first developed a standing, professional army. With the possible exception of the Assyrians this was the first such army in the history of the world. The full-time nature of service in the army allowed for soldiers to look at it as a career (the minimum term of service for an enlisted man was 25 years) and as such saw levels of professionalism improve massively. During the Republic armies were raised at the start of each campaign, this meant that these armies were extremely inexperienced and unwieldy at first (see the disaster at Cannae for what happens when an army that has been hastily scrambled together faces off against a highly experienced, cohesive army). The massive edge that was held by experienced armies can also be seen in the success of the campaigns of Caesar and Scipio. \n\nIn addition to the men and officers (the centurions at least) becoming more professional the change to a standing army under the empire also greatly furthered power-projection. During the Republic the raising and deployment of armies was ad-hoc, with local governors often using armies more to further their own personal plans and ambitions than to defend Rome. While still occasionally (and bloodily) distracted by Civil Wars the army of the Empire was able to focus much more closely on defending the border and fighting Rome's enemies. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy has written extensively on the military of this period. imo the best starting place for understanding the army of the Roman Empire would be his 'The Complete Roman Army'.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427142660", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I mean, there's no way you walk in there and not think \"oh hey, this is a Blackhawks bar\"\n\nThen these two drunken idiots, both of them girls, walk by us a few times, and every time they've got something cheeky to say.

But I kept it civil.\n\nExcept later we are stood outside after the game (which we lost rather horribly) having a smoke and out they come and start talking shit as they walk to a taxi. So I just call 'em cunts again. This big lad that was with them didn't like that though, gave me a warning and told me to cool it. I told him to do the same with his friends and that would have been it, until he went and said something cheeky about the game and how we lost it as he was getting in the taxi. I don't know who stopped me, the bouncer by the door or one of my friends, but I just flew at 'em. Being a prat and trading some jabs is one thing, but shitting on my team as you are about to basically run away... bah. Couldn't stand it.

Even outside this extreme example, poise definitely works, it's just not as op as in DkS 1.\n* The sweet spot mechanic is awesome and actually rewards skillful use of some weapons. Especially Halberds and Scythes can do disgusting amounts of dmg in capable hands... Also, the sweet spot mechanic was also present in DeS, and even in DkS 1 to a lesser degree.\n* Magic is OP? U wot m8? There are very few casters who are able to use spells in PvP effectively (e.g. DarkProjectMayhem). I'm on a pure physical dmg melee build and all I have to do is dodge their first spell (easy as shit), get close and pressure them.

You are going to hate on this multi-million dollar production because you don't like the three facts you know about one character in it. \n\nYou don't know shit. Get to bed, kid, you got school in the morning. \n\n&gt;In conclusion, go fuck yourself you stupid cunt\n\nu wot m8? \n\n&gt;do your research\n\nI'm not sure an article with two statements that relay three paltry facts about the character in question counts as research. This shit has been proliferating through the internet for the past year.\n\nHere's the problem you neckbeards *really* have with this version of Dr. Doom:\n\nYou autists idolize Vic Von D. He's a memetic badass who gets the upper hand on the handsome scientist and his hot wife, he's the robot that can defeat the chads and never really loses because it's all part of a grand plan. He's the chessmaster none of you are, he's a perfect benevolent dictator like you'd think you'd be, he's a tech genius like Tony Stark without being a total chad like Tony Stark and he's also mastered magic, something that faggot Reed Richards and his friends won't even accept as a legit science and therefore it makes Doom superior. \n\nNow this version of Doom comes along and with three known facts already reflects the negative aspects of you autist neckbeards-He's highly computer literate and he blogs with a ridiculous screen name (not unlike infinity_machine) that he probably takes too seriously-Victor Domashev is probably delusional and mentally ill, not unlike the neckbeards who hate on a film they haven't seen for petty reasons. \n\nActually, in that regard you are like Dr. Doom-his face suffers a slight scar and he must hide it from the world, just like your egos take a hit when the noble demon of the comics gets reflected back at you, rather than projected into your delusional mental fantasy world. \n\nYou're the kind of motherfucker who blames women because you're too disgusting or disinteresting to attract one. \n\nIn conclusion, go beat off to some comic books you adult child and grow up. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427266057", "subreddit": "Marvel", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

He looks up at the sky and thinks there's gotta be better ways to spend his time.\n\nHe continues walking, mindful of the wildlife that surrounds him, the incessant trill and chirp of nature. Without warning an animal races past him, sending him back on his elbows.\n\n\"What was that!\" he cried, knowing he'd get no response. It was a large bird, bigger than he'd ever seen around here. It looked out of place.\n\nThe bird looked back at him from a safe distance, \"clear the road, asshole!\"\n\nThe man sat in stunned silence as his brain tried to process what had just happened. There was no doubt in his mind that he heard what he heard, but why? It wasn't supposed to happen like this.\n\n\"Happen like what?\" he asked. What?\n\n\"You wot m8!\" the emu said, fluffing its feathers, drawing near. He picked up a stick and held it at arms length. That's probably for the best, since this is all rather odd.\n\n\"You know you can't outrun him, right?\" a voice behind him said. He glanced around, and saw noone there. What the hell is going on?\n\n\"I'll tell you what's going on, that emu wants to fight, you want to crap your pants, and the narrator is a dumbass,\" the raccoon said, coming into the open.\n\n\"A talking raccoon? What?\" he asked?\n\n\"Oi! U think ur mate's gonna back you up? 1v1 me u cunt!\" the emu barked.\n\n\"You don't even make sense, a emu with a british accent in america?\" the raccoon said.\n\n\"Ha! Ur mum made a few cents off me boys last night!\" the emu cackled, prancing around, its hat tilted to the side, which he hadn't noticed until now.\n\n\"My mom's dead, you insensitive prick,\" the raccoon said, baring its teeth. He stood the wondering if he should mediate this argument, or get away while he had the chance.\n\n\"I think I'll get away,\" he said, turning to come face to face with a large bear, rearing up on its hind legs. A freaking bear?\n\n\"Not freaking bear, stupid american! I am russian bear, greatest of all bears!\" it growled, as it took a long swig from a bottle.\n\n\"Where did you come from?\" the raccoon asked.\n\n\"Ya mum's house!\" the emu yelled as a car plowed into it from above.\n\n\"Was driving, got lost, now am here, ah there's car, I will go now,\" he garbled as he stumbled toward the wreck.\n\n\"Is this real life?\" he wondered out loud.\n\n\"Nope, you're a character in a story,\" the raccoon said, trying to keep pace, \"and the narrator is an asshole.\"\n\nJust then a large branch whipped back and hit the raccoon in the face, sending him reeling. The man stood there, wondering what this all meant, and what he could do to make sense of all this.\n\n\"Pardon me sir,\" a large voice boomed behind him. He jumped in fright at the sound, and spun around to see a huge animal he'd not seen before. It had a long neck, and it craned down to met his gaze.\n\n\"What? What are you?\"\n\n\"Get out of here Loch Ness monster!\" the raccoon yelled, making his way back, \"nobody has anything for you! Go away!\"\n\n\"Aww, fine,\" it said as it dove into the lake they were standing next to, which none has noticed until now. That's rather odd. They were supposed to be in an endless forest, what is this?\n\n\"Yeah, what is this?\" the man said.\n\n\"I saw giant lizard, where did he go,\" the bear said, stumbling over to us.\n\n\"I think I'll be going now, it's been a pleasure but this is all too weird for me,\" the man said, \"okay narrator get me the hell out of here.\"\n\n\"Like I said, don't bother,\" the raccoon said, \"the narrator is a dick.\" And suddenly the raccoon was hit in the face by a branch whipping back into place, sending him skipping across the surface of the pond.\n\n\"Narrator is heavy handed and vain, not unlike russian leaders,\" the bear grumbled, \"is why we drink.\"\n\n\"Yeah well there's gotta be a way out of this,\" the man said, digging around under the leaves. He could see the outline of a square gray box, it had the word... *save*. Hey get away from that!\n\n\"Oh, is that a threat?\" the man taunted, unaware of the large asteroid coming directly toward him.\n\n\"Look human, large rock coming. Will make lots of noise, and big mess, not unlike russian leaders,\" the bear said, pointing its paw to the sky.\n\n\"Shut up, I just have to reach down and hit this,\" the man said as he ducked under the branch that... should have whipped him in the face... what?\n\n\"Narrator, you're a world-class douchebag, I hope you know that,\" the man said, unaware of the dozen tactical warheads launched at his exact location, \"and yeah I hope the emu takes care of your mom, asshole!\"\n\nThe man tried to press the small gray button, just out of reach, as the Loch Ness monster leaped out of the pond.

{"body": "&gt;You're faking! You're very good, or I would have caught you sooner! \n\nu wot m8\n\n&gt;The fact that it's not a detailed description doesn't mean it's not true. Were you expecting a book length description in a redditt comment? That's silly. I cited two texts that confirm my assertions. \n\nI didn't expect a book length description. What I did expect from you was a description that was fair. You posted something that oversimplified something to the detriment of the theories in question. It's uncharitable. You posted two texts on feminism and you quoted from one source (without giving it) on Post-structuralism and you went on to misinterpret those quotes because you aren't familiar with the literature. I don't think a request for fairness on a philosophy subreddit is unreasonable.\n\n&gt;I did support it. By citing two popular textbooks, and quoting an encyclopedia. \n\nWhere in those sources did it say anything about feelings and their relationship to truth? I asked you for the quotes but you wont give them to me. I didn't the word feelings in anything you cited and when I called you out on it you said, \"the meaning is in the quote\". That's not an answer and you've repeatedly failed to demonstrate how feelings play a role in any of this. If you have a specific quote that you find problematic then present it.\n\n&gt;That doesn't mean any of the conclusions are well reasoned or well supported. Or correct. There is a voluminous literature underpinning homeopathy and tarot. But, like feminist scholarship, they are kooky and wrong. \n\nOf course not. There is a voluminous literature surrounding Kant but I don't agree with everything that scholars have to say. If you want to be dismissive of a field of study then you should try getting the tenets right first. Also, how is tarot card reading on the same level as talk of social construction? That's highly unintuitive.\n\n&gt;A system for discovering the answers to questions is useful if it yields answers and the answers are correct. \n\nThis seems to be a highly problematic notion that you have presented. The notions of \"answer\" and \"correct\" are ambiguous and even if we take the common understanding of the terms used, not all correct answers are useful (since useful is a pragmatic word that is not necessarily truth-tracking). You also fail to define what you mean by correct. You say, \"According to feminists, whatever a feminist feels is correct is correct. According to tarot card crooks, whatever the crook says is correct.\" That's not an answer to the question. \n\n&gt;Feminists don't generate hypothesis or theories. These are empirical concepts. Feminists misappropriate the terms to trick readers into thinking their conclusions are correct. A hypothesis is based on evidence, and is falsifiable. What feminist \"hypothesis\" can falsify the existence of patriarchy? Given your expertise, it should be easy for your to find innumerable examples. If they exist. But you can't. Because they don't. A hypothesis does not have a pre-determined outcome. But feminist \"hypotheses\" always do. They always, from inception, and without testing, prove the existence of patriarchy. \n\nYou're equivocating on the use of \"theory\". There is theory as meta-discourse (an analysis of how we look at the world, how social relations operate, how language operates, etc.) and there is theory as some descriptive account of something that generates testable predictions. Feminists involved in Marxism could show how capitalism generates a sexual/economic division of labor that would underprivilege them economically or you could say that in patriarchal societies women are going to excluded through institutions of power relations (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.) or discursive practices. It's not hard to think of ways to falsify patriarchy in the second sense of theory. If you want falsification in the first sense as well then you've fundamentally misunderstood the project of a critical theory.\n\n&gt;Likewise, theories are falsifiable and arise from many branches of evidence, rather than a single foundation. Feminism fails both of these tests. No feminist \"theory\" can disprove the existence of patriarchy. None is grounded in a strand of evidence that does not presume the existence of patriarchy.\n\nWhich feminists take it as an assumption? \n\n&gt;All of them. It's a requirement. Don't believe me? Okay, give me a list of substantial post structuralists that say there is no gender inequity. You're an expert. This should be easy. \n\nName names. Give me citations. \n\n&gt;No it's not. Patriarchy is assumed to exist in all cultures, and contradictory evidence is dismissed. Otherwise, there would be nothing to criticize, and no critical theory. If men possess considerably more capital, that's an example of patriarchy. Men are powerful. Women are abused. If women possess considerably more capital, that's an example of patriarchy. Women are burdened, the male leisure class lives off the sweat of women. There was a time in the US when men earned more money than women for the work they did. Critical theorists call this patriarchy and assert that powerful men abused weak women. Now women receive more compensation than men for the work they do. Critical theorists also call this patriarchy and assert that powerful men abuse weak women. Patriarchy is not \"discovered\" based on evidence. It is assumed a priori. All contradictory evidence is obscured, dismissed, or insulted. \n\nWhy are they wrong? You assume that fact means that patriarchy is false but why does it. Generally refutations require more work than citing data points. \n\n&gt;Okay, you read the first of the textbooks I cited, and I'll read Barthes. \n\nI've asked you for the problematic passage in the links you gave. I didn't see what supported your viewpoint. If you care about fairness though reading Barthes would be good since it will help you understand the position you're criticizing. \n\n&gt;I get it. Feminist authors don't exist. Scientists exist. Their observations exist. Their experiments exist. And they mean what they mean no matter who reads about them, and even if nobody reads about them. \n\nI don't think you do. Anyways, observation is (most likely) [theory-laden](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/#HowObsEviMigTheLad) and so the idea that observation and data have the objectivity that you ascribe to them is dubious. How do we determine the proper way to perform experiments? How do we know that method is truth-tracking or not? What is meaning?\n\n&gt;I get it. Within feminism, a thing is true only to the extent that a reader feels that it's true because he is on similar epistemic standing in regards to the feelings of the author.\n\nYou're inserting the word feeling without any warrant to do so. Within literary studies (which is my field of study), if you hand in an essay that has a basis in Post-structuralism and you talk about your feelings on a text you'll fail your essay. The reader has just as much to say as an author on a text.\n\n&gt;I agree. But science is very totalitarian and does not permit liberal interpretation. That's why feminism is unscientific. \n\nThat's simply not how science is done (I say this based on my own philosophical commitments). I suggest reading people like Paul Feyerabend or John Dupre to get an idea of the argument I'm making. [Here](http://www.academia.edu/5669593/The_Abundant_World_Paul_Feyerabend_s_Metaphysics_of_Science) is an example. Science as a totalitarian project is what's \"unscientific\".\n\n&gt;Externally, they are. But internally, post structuralists do not tolerate any dissent! They marginalize dissenters and attack them by saying they have \"personal issues\" if they disagree, and imply that anyone who disagrees is mentally ill, like you did with your psychiatrist comment. \n\nYou must not read much of the literature if you think dissent isn't tolerated. The multiplicity of views and critical approaches within critical theory and specifically post-structuralism is enormous and not all them of agree on fundamental tenets. I called you out for getting basic things wrong about some philosophical traditions and then said that your argument amounted to whining and emoting. Emoting is a sign of a personal problem with something. I don't think Habermas simply has a personal problem with the idea of Post-Modernism or whatever because he actually puts forth arguments and has interesting things to say.\n\n&gt;I know! Because there are multiple feelings about a given text. And they are all correct, unless they challenge the underlying dogma. \n\nPluralism is not committed to the idea that all interpretations are correct. It is only committed to the idea that there are numerous good interpretations that can be discriminated against (by which I mean compared and rejected). There are anti-relativist feminists: Donna Haraway and Helen Longino come to mind.\n\n&gt; One feminist might say that men oppress women because they are inherently morally defective. And she's right! Another person might interpret the same text to mean that men oppress women because biologically pre-destined to do so. We have a place in the feminist tent for her. \n\nPeople may interpret a text in a particular way; however, that doesn't mean they have exhausted the text or come up with a good interpretation of the text. \n\n(continued)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427566748", "subreddit": "askphilosophy", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not butt hurt in the slightest. Maybe you should consider however that perhaps you only perceive Reddit as an anti-American circlejerk because you are an American. \n\nAs a European I see a preponderance of American stuff getting upvoted, a whole host of weird American opinions on Europe like how it's a big white homogeneous place where we hate immigration, people telling me the EU is going to fail because apparently 'socialism always does', I see \"Murica fuck yeah\" and \"Muh Moon landing\" comments getting hundreds of upvotes and gold, be they jokes or not. As an American on Reddit you're privileged that when an American video is posted it's not spammed with comments asking for \"a translation\" because of the accents, people trying to phonetically approximate your dialect, and a whole host of stereotypes. French video? Bring on the jokes about surrender and cowardice. Australian video? 'Throw another shrimp on the barbie' 'G'day mate' and Crocodile Dundee. Irish video? Top o' tha morning to ya!

And when we do provide explanation, you stick your fingers in your ears and shout 'lalalalala!' So — **we explain but you refuse to listen**. If you refuse to listen, that doesn't mean we aren't explaining. And you'd be wise to start listening and stop telling gamergate supporters what Gamergate is actually about according to your headcanon.\n\n&gt;In this list of six terrible things that have happened to you\n\nYou might want to read that bit again\n\n&gt;none of them are from before the event; they are all reactions to gamergate behaving badly.\n\nIndiecade/IGF thing was happening before GG. Boobplate was before GG.\n\n&gt;The only one vaguely close to an explanation is three; but gamergate isn't attacking the AAA games that give junkets to reviewers; \n\n    #include &lt;shadowofmordor.h&gt;\n\nOh, and you must have missed the first /v/ The Musical. There were at least three or four songs shitting over journalism a whole year before gamergate was a thing.\n\n&gt;You didn't make the game, they aren't attacking people who made the game. \n\nActually they are as far as pillars of eternity go. Larian got a lot of heat because of the boobplate, too.\n\n&gt;Why are you complaining about a text-adventure instead of complaining about quick-time events? \n\n... Except we aren't complaining about text-adventure... and we do complain about QTE abuse. The three complaints about Rev60 are shit gameplay, shit graphics and the fact that Rev60 is 90% QTE. Last time I checked there was plenty of people complaining over QTE in the latest Tomb Rider. It does seem that QTE craze is fairly recent (last two years or so), which coincides nicely with time since my hardware can't keep up with minimum requirements of the new AAA stuff. (Not to mention that as almost full-time Lunix user, there's not much AAA games to select from). Mass Effect 3, Dragon Age 2 and Sim Shitty 2013 all got plenty of crap, too. There was Watchdogs and the downgrade — we've been hearing about that for months. The (do not) Order 1886 apparently got plenty of shit because QTE, reskinned boss fight and other bullshit. And Unity got massively shat on immensely because it's a fundamentally broken game. DA: Inquisition is being criticised for shallow story and being a single player MMO (which is a shame because it feels like Dragon Age devs are one of the rare people who know what a dragon looks like, unlike Bethesda (Skyrim)).\n\n&gt;and #gamergate still tweets at FemFreq and @Quinspiracy (you can watch it happening);\n\nYea.

{"body": "Pretty late to this post but i'll share regardless:  \nJunior year in Highschool. I was already a regular MDMA user (about twice a month) and always stupidly did it at school because at the time parents were very strict and never let me out of my house other than for school related activities. For those in the State of California, it was around the time they did CAHSEE testing (A state required high school exit exam, basically either you pass this test or you dont graduate.) Early in the morning I had purchased a few ecstasy pills off my dealer at the time and didnt plan to take any of them until around my 3rd period. This would be around 11am for my school and lunch was around 12-12:30. I planned these out strategically so that my peak would happen during lunch hours and then the come down happens during my last 2 periods and after school. However this day was different. A friend of mine in my english class wanted to know what the pills looked like. I showed him and told him some of the reports on them from pillreports.com and he dared me to take them in that class. After about 15 minutes of \"No dude, you know I don't take them until later\" and \"Oh come on pussy\" I gave in due to feeling confident in taking care of myself. So I tilt my head up and launch the pill into my throat and dry swallow it. As I put my head back down my teacher *yells* out my name and my jaw hits the floor as I'm facing my friend. I swear he saw me swallow the pill and so I turn around and slowly croak out \"Yes, Mr. anon?\" \"Hey, I just got a call from the office, you are being requested to retake your CAHSEE exam.\" (Normally the test is taken during your sophomore year and there is an English part and a Mathematics part. I unfortunately had failed the English section the previous year)  \n*In my head* \"U FUCKING WOT M8?!?!?!?!\"  \n\"Uhh.. Okay...\" I turn back around to my friend. \"DUDE. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO. WHAT. THE. FUCK. DO. I. DO.\"  \nHe says: \"Dude.. I don't know. You dun' goof'd now!\"  \n\"Thanks *asshole*\" And I slowly walk out of the classroom and to the area where the tests were being held. My entire body is shaking like a fucking vibrator due to paranoia as I walk in to the room with the others taking the test. I see some familiar faces and try to sit next to them but administration makes me sit in another seat far from anyone I recognize immediately.  \n\"Okay everyone, take out your materials and begin\" Skip ahead about 30 mins. Lines on paper begin to blur, the specific line of words I'm reading are super defined where as the rest appear to be a mile away on the paper, chair humping etc etc etc. No idea what the fuck I wrote in the essay portion of the test but I unbelievably managed to pass it with full points.

{"body": "I’ve had writer’s block on this forever, so I’m just going to do a flash forward, seems the easiest way to solve the problem right now. \n\n\n\n**United Nations Security Council, New York City, USA\nMarch 13th 2021**\n\nThere was no hiding it any more. Two weeks ago, amateur astronomers had found a set of objects moving towards Earth from the outer solar system. Photos from Hubble and James Webb had shown small, white triangles, moving at a rate faster than any known man-made object. \n\nA leak by a senior officer in the Russian Military had set the media into a frenzy, while the world’s space agencies continued to deny the very existence of the object, trying to buy some time for the world’s governments to figure out what the hell was going on, and what they could do to stop it. \n\nAnd so, the UN Security Council convened, with the remaining members of the G20 sending representatives as well. \n\nStanding in front of the members of the worlds most powerful nations was a group of scientists, some quite visibly nervous.\n\nThe ESA representative was the first to speak. \n\n“We’ve known about these objects for almost a month. We believe that this is a group of artificial objects, which had recently arrived in our solar system by unknown means. Much of this is beyond any of our current understanding, but we do know that these objects are not natural. Space based observations have shown more and more detail, and a lucky opprutnity by the American Juno orbiter has given us a few higher detail images.”\n\nHe gestured to the screen, which showed a pixelated image of a triangular wedge, with blue pixels flickering at the rear, and a slight amount of detail. \n\n“This wedge is an almost direct match for an earlier incident, which my colleague from NASA will inform you about”\n\nA delegate attempted to cut him off, but a sharp glare from the American and Russian delegates made her sit back down. \n\nThe NASA representative took out a flash drive, and the image on the projector changed to a small blot on the Moon.  \n\n“Back in February, a large explosion occurred on the service of the moon, visible from Earth. We told people it was a rogue comet. It was not. We had a spacecraft in orbit at the time, and they were able to get both video and an eyewitness account. Please watch”\n\nAn image of the surface of the moon appeared, still and unchanging. A small craft was seen, which was the counterpart ship to the American orbiter. A flash of bright light covered the screen, and a massive ship appeared out of nowhere, barreling at the moon. In less than a second, it was a crater on the surface. \n\n“Let me pause this.”\n\nThe blur on the screen slowed, and image ehcnancment software kicked in, removing excess pixels and clearing up the image. After a moment, a new image emerged. The ship was huge, larger than anything mankind had built. A whitish-gray hull was speckled with lights and structural items. A tower sat at the back of the ship, which had more lights and even a small hole which was presumably a window. At the back where three large cylinders, glowing with a soft blue light. \n\n“This is an almost exact match for the images from Juno, and…”\n\nThe South African delegate blurted out, unable to hold his excitement\n“That’s a fookin Star Destroyer. From Star Wars. Are you serious?”\nThe eyes of the room were on the delegate, and man from NASA. \n\n“…..by all accounts, this is an exact visual match for a Star Destroyer. Now we cannot say…”\n\nThe room exploded into an uproar. The permenant members of the council were being barraged with questions by the rotating members. The scientists tried to remain any sense of order, but it was impossible. \n\n“YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME”\n\n“Este hombre está loco!\"\n\n“Dies ist eine Scheißesturm!\"\n\n“EVERYONE CALM DOWN”\n\nInto the room walked the President of the United States, flanked by the Russian and Chinese Ambassadors, with the English and German Prime Ministers in tow. A horde of security guards, aides and other dignitaries surrounded them. \n\nThe room fell dead silent. Some ambassadors stood up, others fidgeted in their sets, unsure of the protocol. \n\nThe President walked to the front of the room, and an aide brought in a new projector. A blue 3D image materialized in the center of the room, showing the solar system, with the charted positions of the spacecraft. \n\n“These ships will be here in a week. Maybe less. We have no idea what we’re dealing with, but if these things are anything like the source material, we’ve got a mess on our hands. We don’t know what they want, or who they are. But we’ll be ready. The reason you’ve been in the dark is because we’ve been getting ready. Coordinating our space assets, seeing what we can do if we need to send a message. History has shown that first contact can be a messy, deadly thing. We’re going to make sure we buck that trend. We don’t know if this is an an enemy or a friend, but I don’t want to regret finding out.”\n\n**Bridge of the Imperial Star Destroyer *Rectifier*, 6.2 million miles from Earth.** \n\nA small pale globe began to fill the screen. Levan stared at it, cursing his luck. \n“Enginer, what is our hyperdrive state? If we’re dealing with rebels, we need to be able to move quickly\n“Still fried sir. I might be able to coax a microjump out of her, but no farther than the nearest star system. Seems to be the same thing with the other ships in the fleet sir.”\n\nLevan sighed, looking back at the globe that had given him nothing but trouble. \n\n“What’s our intel”\n\nThe intelligence officer perked up, and began to furiously type away at his datapad.\n\n“If the Rebels are here, they must be confident nobody would ever find them, this planet is noisy. No Holonet outlinks, but a lot of radio chatter. Mostly unencrypted. Planet seems to be temperate, with intelligent, humanoid life. Pre-Hyperdrive, but very industrialized. No idea if there are other sentient species. Rebels might be trying to hide in plain sight. Lots of cities, but lots of empty areas. No signs of Rebel activity, but keyword sweeps show a lot of hits. I really don’t know sir”\n\n\n“So wait, this is a developed, pre-Hyperdrive, humanoid society, broadcasting it’s presence to everyone who can hear? And we’ve never found it? \n\n“Galaxy is big sir”\n\n“Still..”\n\nLevan stared out into space, scratching his chin. \n\n“Battle readiness?”\n\n“100% sir, TIE squardrons are ready to go at a moment’s notice”\n\n“….Send in a squadron. Do a sweep. See what we can find, see if we can rattle out some Rebels. Tell this….”Earth”, that the Empire is here. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427749335", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Or at the very least is on par with Race 07 and R3E which I believe carry the most content.\n\nTracks are rather limited and probably the least among every other sim out there, but how many sims can boast laser scanned content?  Only iR?\n\nYour statement is so factually naive, that it reads word for word like it comes from someone that is a console gamer, and is only familiar with GT/Forza.  Those are not sims.  Yes they are obviously on the more realistic side of things compared to arcade, but they do not define the sim racing genre.  Not a single sim has hundreds or thousands of cars.\n\nOnly rF1 has more content than AC.  And that is probably because the game is nearly 10 years old.  None of the content that is worthwhile in rF1 is first party content though, it's all modded.  Whereas **all** of AC's base content is endlessly enjoyable.  Add modded content on top of that and AC is quite well rounded car wise.
