{"body": "&gt; Russians are largely what's wrong with Russia. Specifically their serf-like mentality.\n\nU wot m8? Oh, right, why do I have you tagged as \"said Svoboda and Azov weren't fascist\". Because you argued that here before, and got downvoted even on this sub. Look, I kept telling you that I don't believe that the Ukrainian gov't is fascist or any of that Putinist rubbish. I know full well that Svoboda have hardly any popular support. However, you weren't arguing that, you were literally denying that they were fascist/Neo-Nazi. Anything to whitewash the actions of your countrymen. If you were Russian, you'd be a happy vatnik. Nationalism is in itself wonderfully international. A Russian nationalist is little different from a Ukrainian or an American one. The difference is how the governments of those countries handle nationalists. \n\n&gt;Russians are largely what's wrong with Russia. Specifically their serf-like mentality.\n\nWill quote again. So here's my problem. Ukrainians of these days have a wonderful 'racially aware' mentality that a lot of /r/europe is poorly familiar with. Like, no shit, a lot of Ukrainians speak of Russians as a different \"Asiatic\" race of some sort of people that have some sort of \"racial consciousness\". Fucking bullshit, is what I say, you can go read Mein Kampf if you want that sort of philosophy supported. You cannot speak of people using 'racial consciousness' ideology. It's plain goddamn racist. \n\nAnd the funniest part? Ukrainians and Russians, we are the same people. I don't mean this in a vatnik way, no. I was born in Chernovtsi, USSR. Both of my parents were born in Northern Moldova. Jewish-descendant mother who identified as Ukrainian (our town's Jews were massacred, ones who survived didn't act Jewish any more) and my father more ethnically and linguistically Russian. I have lived in Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine is populated by the exact same people. Never once did I feel the people were somehow different. \n\nWhat's different are geopolitical and economic circumstances. Here is where I think my history education is useful. Things don't happen because there is such a thing as 'national character', well, not in the sense that you describe it. Events happen, they shape nations. Russia had particularly lawless 90s with some of the worst post-Soviet transition of the Soviet republics. A massive difference. A traumatic difference. Imagine US breaks apart and becomes poorer than some Third World countries. Now imagine a new, seemingly effective and strong leader comes in. Bingo. You get Putin. Notice how there is a similarity with Hitler. I'm not trying to Godwin all over here, but Putin and Hitler are products of once-powerful nations broken and humiliated. People will hang onto anyone who inflates their nationalistic erection. Also, you know, people like jobs and money and living standards, that also helps.\n\nUkraine has the exact same people. However, situation a bit different. Ukraine was not a global superpower. Living standards fell, sure, but the situation is different because it's not quite as bad of a hit to national pride. In the 90s the concept of national identity in Ukraine is still weak. Look, I know this firsthand, I attended the Chernivtsi Gymnasium #2 in the early 90s. It's right near the Krasnoarmeskiy Square, beautiful place, on the Golovnoy Prospekt. We went over Ukrainian history. I went to a school that had Russian and Ukrainian classes. Our history was funny, none of us understood why we were Ukrainian and why we were special. I see the schools in the US now as I live in the states and there is a huge difference. Nationalism is very well indoctrinated in the US. This is necessary for the creation of a strong and vibrant national identity. The sort that makes people want to improve their nation, and not just steal from it. I'm not a fan of nationalism, but much like communists seeing capitalism as a necessary stage of development, so I see nationalism as a necessary stage of development. One does not go from nothing into internationalism/globalism, one has to pass through nationalism first. \n\nAnyhow, I am rambling a lot here, but my point is that Ukraine did not have that unifying leader who was perceived to be very effective and who unified people. Therefore the democracy in Ukraine was allowed to live. Had Ukraine gotten a Lukashenko, Ukraine would have been a dictatorship too. That's why I can't stand smug Ukrainian pricks like you. Russia is shit, but it's not shit because the Russian people are actually at fault here and because Russians are some sort of retards who follow leaders slavishly whilst Ukrainians are progressive liberal democrats. Russians, as all people, are influenced by circumstance. Why did Ukraine become democratic and Belarus not? Ukraine never had a leader who could bring stability like Lukashenko. Quite literally, and I stress this, Ukraine is democratic because of its *incompetence*. Now, it's partially a snide remark aimed at your direction, but also partially a historical commentary. Democracy is often incompetent, but it is in the long run more stable. Incompetence can be good. Too competent of a leader in a fledgling nation often leads to autocrats being born.

{"body": "I'm really getting tired of this conversation, as much as I'm sure you are.\n\n&gt;&gt; Russian Empire ever wanted to educate their citizens, preferring them in the 'mindless drone' state to keep the power.\n\n&gt; The irony of that statement in context of our discussion is amazing.\n\nGetting a bit of Ad Hominem yourself or I misunderstand you (again)?\n\n&gt; You still did not name a single worse thing that happened to Russia.\nHow much longer do i need to ask you for that ?\n\nWell, for starters, World War II was much worse than anything USSR itself brought, even if you for some obscure reason add the Civil War into 'USSR faults' (I really, really hope you will not blame USSR for WWII also, because that would just be raving mad). Tataro-Mongol occupation was worse for the country. Oprichnina was if not worse then at the same level as Stalin repressions (less victims but far more cruelty). Other numerous wars were worse.\n\nUSSR is not something that \"happened\". It was a 70 years long period with its ups and downs. I repeat, what do you mean when you say \"USSR is the worst thing that happened\"? The way it appeared? The way it conducted industrialization? The way it The way it launched people in space? The way it educated everyone? The way it handled political prisoners? The way it oppressed nearby states? You can't paint with wide strokes here, because some things that happened in USSR were the best things ever (like rise of education, science and engineering), and that by definition is not worst. If you'd just state that Stalin repressions, or Lenin's Red Terror, or even the Civil War was the worst thing, I wouldn't even start this discussion - but you somehow go on claiming that USSR in whole was 'the worst thing'.\n\nAlso, please define 'worse', or better what you consider 'worse' in your question. Worse for country is not necessarily worse for common people, or for some minority, or for international image - and vice versa. You specifically said \"worse to happen to Russia\", not to \"Russian people\" or to \"freedom principles\"; I'm sorry, but metrics in all the areas - economy, education, even level of living for the average person - went up under USSR (yes, not in the first 20 years, and not during the war, but later) in comparison to previous periods. The regime was worse for some people, or even categories of people, but not for the country as a whole.\n\n&gt; Military scientists or somehow related to military.\nMilitary technology does end up in civil use, yes. But science that was useless to military (like psychology) was barely there. \n\nThat's partially true, but why is that exclusively bad? Nuclear program was military, yes, but even today Russia is leading the world in peaceful Nuclear power, something other countries couldn't achieve. And then there is the whole space program, which had VERY little practical military use (apart from launching spy satellites to orbit, which is only a little part of the program), it was more of prestige dick-waving contest with USA, and had far more non-military use. So no, it's not the case of \"we're hungry but they fear our tanks\", it's the case of becoming world leaders in something other than exporting depressing books.\n\nSome sciences were neglected, from psychology to cybernetics, true. But how is that worse than no scientific leadership in any area?\n\n&gt;&gt; income inequality was almost nonexistent in comparison to Europe and America or even Czarist Russia\n\n&gt; Oh lol are you serious ? Yeah, USSR was a dreamland without corruption. Lowly farmer was equal to some guy from government. \n\nNo, he wasn't equal. I don't deal in absolutes - you do. Having lower income disparity doesn't mean that there was NO income disparity. But the Soviet plant worker and country leader were far closer in quality of life than a western plant worker and even that plant owner. Yes, there WAS income inequality and prestigious goods &amp; services access, but nowhere on the scale any capitalistic country (including modern Russia) boasts - if Khruschev was, say, a hundred times as wealthy and comfortable as a miner from Ukraine, then nowadays Putin is several millions times wealthier than a common, say, designer - and that is even more profound in the West. It wasn't all good, and there still was a disparity, but it was simply much, much smaller than in other countries; Party leaders enjoyed caviar every day in large quantities, but even a miner could afford to eat black caviar once a year via the system of 'special food orders' - unlike nowadays, where oligarchs have private jets, multiple villas, islands and private armies while an average worker earns less in a month than 500g of caviar worth.\n\nCapitalism is an awesome system for creating wealth, it's just shitty at distributing it. And I say that from close to the top of capitalistic system, earning five times the cash that my parents do, with their 50 years of experience, combined.\n\nYes, there was a huge amount of corruption in USSR, that is the real downfall of the 'communist' system and central planning, and it made the system worse. But there were positive sides to it too. I much prefer capitalism, but to not see that it has flaws that 'communist' central planning didn't have is short-sighted.\n\n&gt; And are you implying that Russian Empire was not recognized ? U wot ?\n\nIt was, certainly. But it was simply one of the large countries, and far from being the most influential or wealthiest. USSR - together with USA - shaped the whole XX century, much like Spanish Empire and British Empire did in centuries before. The levels are incomparable, really.\n\nAgain, I'm not claiming that USSR was a paradise or even \"the best that happened to Russia\". But it wasn't \"the worst thing that happened\".

{"body": "Horrible.  Their big pitch is more 4.0s at OU and the only way to make that happen would be to lower the academic standards to allow mid-range 3-point scores to be boosted to 4.0s.  That makes OU look worse, and it just minimizes the achievement of those students already getting 4.0s.  You really think OU will do that?  They'll do that right after they create the varsity football program lol.  \n\nWalter and Kubinski gave students ear candy and they bought it.  They'll be lucky to achieve anything on their platform.   \n\nOh, another part of their platform was that they need to put more outlets in the OC....U wot?  You couldn't come up with a more serious issue?  I'm sure OU will just let you guys walk right in there and redo all the wiring and electrical systems too lol.  \n\nThey also want to push for expansion of the OC...Expansion of the OC has already been put into place lol.  They're pitching something that has already been taken care of.\n\nWalter is also known to be a very vocal homophobe and was standing with the Genocide Awareness Project the day AFTER the elections closed (Tuesday/the second day the GAP was here).\n\nIt may sound like I'm overreacting, but OUSC has the ability to make really big differences on campus when they work hard enough, but not with these two.  Even though OUSC is just students, together as one voice, while not having any real changing power can really push students' demands on OU.  Walter and Kubinski didn't run to do that.  They ran for the status to put on their resumes.    \n\nWhere they got all those votes from, I have no clue.  When they announced who won, maybe five people in a room of 50+ clapped or cheered.

{"body": "I usually play low contact because its beer league and I'm a shitty skater. When I was just starting out I hadn't played any full contact yet and I was playing a pick up game, I make a comment about wanting to try full contact to try and improve my game a bit while I was sitting on the bench. Next shift I reach for the puck and body block a forward, it was supposed to be no full checks but he played mostly checking. He goes down and puts his shoulder into me on reflex, really a great hit, he had a decent foot of height on me and ducked hard so he wouldn't take my head off. Of course when you aren't playing checking you don't exactly expect guys to hit you, so I am in no way prepared, I'm inexperienced and basically defenseless. Get launched through the air because I weigh 130lbs, and land on the ice god knows how far away. I go limp and everyone thinks I'm dead when in reality I'm thinking maybe if I don't move it will hurt less and everyone will forget it happened. No such luck, I skate back to the bench looking like the jackass rookie who killed Christmas, everyone's having a good laugh. I get checked out for a concussion while I'm on the bench, and while I'm sitting some fuckin bender slides over on the bench and says \n\n\"Well you said you wanted to get hit\"\n\nI never wanted to pull someones jersey over their head and rearrange their kidneys more in my entire life. Moral of the story, don't say stupid shit on the bench and expect your teammates not to chirp you. They are cheeky cunts. \n\n\nBonus chirp:\nI play right D, and I had this crazy annoying left wing that would throw temper tantrums behind my net. He would spend most of his shifts cherry picking and then when he got foiled in the offensive zone he would start cursing behind the net. He comes flying down the wing, having received the puck from his teammates who where carefully trying to not strangle him. Its an easy block, idiot won't fight for position and telegraphs any moves he's making like the caption on a silent film. So I attack his stick, force the shot into my shins and outlet it to the waiting center. Dude has a fucking brain aneurysm and just starts wailing on the back of our net. My normal D partner is in net, so I hang around to make sure he isn't getting any of it and too make sure he won't cherry pick. Yet still he spends like half a minute just losing it. I fucking snap and scream at him \"You know the rest of your team is still playing fucking hockey right\" I honestly felt bad for the assholes that had to back check twice as hard because this useless cunt was cutting circles through the neutral zone when we had a rush and now he pulls this shit because he fucking thinks he's hot shit but can't shoot worth a damn. So he says whatever and skates back to the BENCH. All while we are still in the offensive zone clearly getting chances. I rejoin the actual game and later bitch to my captain who just tells me if I'm making wings cry I'm doing something right.\n\nTL:DR\nI really fucking hate left wings", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428054807", "subreddit": "hockey", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I'm thinking no way, this must be my lucky day, I've got a miracle list as far as my arm and a cute tootsie with class? \n\nI dive down there, jack flash with a raging one for the spoils of a massacre, when - and you won't believe this part - the dame pulls out a fucking revolver. \n\"This mugging just turned to a murder\" I says nearly a pavement tile - would've walked all over me (me, of all fucking things). \nThen this kid laughs. \nDame's got a revolver in her hand, outstretched dainty little twigs gripping an oversized hammer with child hands, and this guy is laughing point blank. Miracles be damned, this ending ain't no horror, shit's twisted you know?

Ain't no reveal to me, but to a human it's like lightning through your system where the dead parts come alive, all that fear in the gut that makes you shit yourself. But, oh, this fucking dame she ain't acting up. She lowers the revolver. \n\nYou'd think, come on - don't do that. No, no, no, don't do that you dumb bitch! I'm close to yelling at this point but interrupting ain't so much a crime as a couple Hail Mary's, but I've been warned and the next time I'm chucked out.\n\nThis corpse goes for her. You're screaming on the inside and there's popcorn in your greasy paws as you munch, munch, munch. \n\nWell, this dame don't bat her lids but a new one for the movies: a fucking stake.

{"body": "It's 3am, all you can hear in little Timmy's house is the mashing of buttons, the sharp push of analog sticks, timing the perfect 360° noscope. Little Timmy is one kill away from his favourite kill-streak when his life is taken by what he refers to as a \"faggot camper\".\n\" You fucking faggit, wait there I'm gonna noscope you I'm in FaZe\" he shouted down his low quality mic. You could hear the sharp crunch of Duritos™ coming from his widened mouth followed by a loud guzzle of Mountain Dew™\n\"Shut the fuck up kid\" is the reply from XxNewbSc0PezxX\n\"Faggot, I'll have you know my dad works for...\" His sentence was cut short from what sounded like an earthquake.  Timmy took one last sip of his now empty Mountain Dew™ Code red® can. Timmy peered out the window, for a breif moment he could see a strange rounded object, which vanished in a flash. A faint green light could be seen in the distant forest, the light was warm and inviting. So much so that he dropped his Duritos™ and snuck out the house to investigate, Xbox controller still in hand.\n\nTimmy arrived at the forest, his surroundings pitch black. With only the guidence of the flashing light he navigated his way to the unidentified object. He starred in awe at the enormous object before him, it hovered gently above the ground before finally making a graceful decent. A small tremour could be felt as the the object struck the ground. The forest sprung to life as birds fluttered away and animals previously unseen scattered off like they could sense the shrekage® about to happen. At closer inspection Timmy now realised why he was so drawn to this object, everything from the power button, the disc tray and the dusty Duritos™ crumbs from last year were here, it was an exact replica of his Xbox 360.\n\nTimmy moved closer to the Xbox, his curiosity got the best of him, he couldn't leave this alone, maybe this was faze finally accepting his application. He looked at the controller, still tightly gripped in his hand and tossed it at the power button. The controller hit right in the centre of the humongous power button and then ricochet off it, landing back down on the hard ground. The distinct Xbox startup sound ringed through the forest. The disc tray slowly opened leaving Timmy in suspence. After what felt like an eternity the disc tray fully opened and beamed down a huge bright light, briefly blinding Timmy before it eventually died down. A mysterious figure appeared out of the light. Timmy stared at the figure that was approaching him.\n\"Kevin spacey?\" He wisperred in disbelief \n\"Wag1 Cunt\" Kevin replied.\n\"After years of listening to your voice it is gr8 to meet you xXBl4Z3d4D4yZzzXx of clan tag [FaZe]. We have intercepted your communication Xbox devices and have taken form most comfortable for you. We come in ally clan invitation and offer the dankest kush from your prophet Snoop dog of clan [Smoke Weed everyday] and ask of you not to treat us like fucking skrubs and to be sparred of your 360° quikscoping skillz. For many earth years we have trained ourselfs in the ways of your kind. We have limited our eyes to 30 frames per second and 720p to give us the most cinematic experience when nuking faggots on COD. We have abducted several of your species known as the MILFS and fucked them to give is an idea of how you roll in Pu55y, and have accustomed ourselfs to your foods by eating nothing but Duritos™ and Mountain dew™. However we must disclaim that my dad works for Microsoft and is going to have your account banned if I ever see you fucking camping fucking faggot. On these terms I hope our clans can 420 blaze with shrek on the highest peak of kush mountain together and truly become MLG.\"\n\nTimmy stood in silence for a moment letting this all sink in. He realised now that his actions have consequences and his name calling and mum fucking online has influenced an entire race of sentient beings who might of otherwise learned what humanity is truley about. He turned around and started to head back to his home. This displeased the new alien race, and the Kevin spacey lookalike exclaimed \"Where are you going? You honestly thingk your fucking funny mate messing with my freinds!?\" Kevin grabbed his DSR 420 and tried to 360° noscope Timmy but instead flopped to the ground helplessly.\n\"I'll fucking rek u cheeky cunt\" he shouted as Timmy disappeared into the distance.\n\nAfter heading back to his house Timmy climmed in through the back window and crept back to his room. After arriving he threw his Xbox, his controllers and all his Dew™ out the window before laying in bed, reflecting on what just happened.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428107698", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;  take you've obviously read books from about every ideology, guaranteeing that you don't fall in any pre-stablished dogma. By extension i believe that every idea you hold was questioned by taking into account other points of view, instead of simply believing the first edgy thing you heard, reading about things from that point of view and only that point of view.\n&gt; Because otherwise, you're like the majority you think you're superior from, perhaps with a different ideology or a more extense vocabulary, but the same train of thought,\n\nU wot m8?\n\nI'm in political science @ uni and I'm the top of my class, I don't even study because I've been reading books about this shit since I was quite young. I talk to my brother who minor'd in poli sci and talk to my profs a lot outside of class fairly consistently. I've taken various polls made to gauge general knowledge by reputable polling centers, which most people (adults) somehow fuck up on even though they're basic concepts. \n\nAs far as logic goes, well I took a class in logic and was #1 in it out of 300 people in university, who are presumably better than your average 15 y/o. I've also scored very high on the LSAT since grade 12, which people typically take after university and tests logic. \n\nOther than that, I've was valedictorian in HS, even though I barely went. I've been #1 in 3/5 of my uni classes so far, was top 5 in the other 2 (out of 150-300 people each) and read current events, science journals, political journals, etc. fairly regularly. Not to mention polls on average knowledge of political shit almost universally show that the public really has no idea what the fuck they're talking about. \n\nAnd yeah, I haven't settled on any political system as my favorite yet- I think most of them are flawed in light of critically assessing them. I quite often intentionally argue against my own view point, or seek people who disagree with it to argue with. \n\nIMO there should be a minimum requirement of knowledge of the system. If everyone is competent, then great, everyone can vote. It shouldn't be a huge barrier but I don't want freddy from the down the street to walk in and vote, who knows literally nothing about politics except that \"PM XXX has a great smile!

{"body": "My all time favorite chapter in ASOIAF is [Arya IV from GOT](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_50), the chapter when shit hits the fan in KL. It's such an intensely scary and sad moment in time for her, and I feel it immediately foreshadows Arya's entire arc throughout the story.\n\nAt the start of the chapter, Arya is training with Syrio, but suddenly none other than fookin' Meryn Trant shows up with the Kingsguard to try and take her away.  Syrio, being the badass he is, sacrifices himself to protect her -- giving her just enough time to dash away.  \n\nBut then while running and sneaking her way throughout the Red Keep, just trying to stay one step ahead of her chasers, Arya finds the bodies of her fathers' men strewn about (dead or dying).  You can just see the moment in the text when everything becomes real for her, her heart breaks, and she realizes that the promises made by all the adults in her life can't protect her anymore.  \n\nThings continue to get worse. At the exact moment when Arya finds her sword Needle in an overturned chest in the stables she is caught by a stableboy, and in a panic wheels around \"sticking him with the pointy end,\" all the way straight through and out the back of his body.  I don't have the book in front of me to quote the lines directly, but the frantic and scared response of both Arya and the stableboy to the fact that he's just been stabbed are incredibly raw, and demonstrate how quickly violence in one generation can beget even unintentional violence in the next. \n\nBy the end of the chapter Arya manages to get herself into the dungeons under the Red Keep (where they keep the Dragon skulls), but she's still not safe.  Knowing that there is literally nowhere else to go and nobody else to turn to for protection Arya has to forge on ahead alone, plunging deeper and deeper into the darkness, trying to find her way back out into a world where things are still as they once were.  \n\nIn many ways it feels like she's still on this journey alone through the darkness and still hasn't found a way out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428180571", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 49, "controversiality": 0}

I do not remember that being an actual strat in 1.6 or GO until introduction of CZ. Everyone and their dog were crying that CZ if OP and it is overused because it is overpowered. It got nerfed. Now people cry about Tec9. Devs decide to pseudonerf tec9 yet at the same time all they do is push you to use SMGs. It is not that we wanted SMGs and their aggro gameplay, it is not that pros were using SMGs with any great success, simply, they were making little sense and were useful in peculiar strats/situations.

{"body": "So a megathron (and battleships in general) are kinda hard to project in solo because its really hard to kill ships smaller than you.\n\nA megathron gets 8 lows (one of the only battleships IIRC to get 8 lows) so you can really tank this thing out the ass, apply a nano or something and get some ridiculous speed.  However the speed of the mega is still dwarfed by other cruisers.  You can shit upwards of 1000 dps with blasters but rails aren't a bad option.  I would suggest Neutron Blaster Cannon II's, bring loads of Null and Fed Navy antimatter.  Equip a web and scram, cap booster and a MWD.  The web will be key to slowing frigs to nothing then blap them with antimatter. Use your drones too, bring 3 sets of light drones, not one set of mediums and one set of lights in case they start shooting at you.\n\nRails are harder to fit, but using 325mm rails will help get the range and a little better tracking than 425mm rails.  This is one is harder to fit because the Mega doesn't have much PG to play with.  Don't try and active tank it, its harder to do this because lack of PG.  You can put two 1600mm plates, your resists, DCU, and a damage mod, and if you have that 8th lowslot left over, a nano.\n\nYour rigs will have to be either tracking rigs, range rigs or damage rigs, don't bring trimarks because you'll be sub 1000m/s if you don't have the PG then I'd just scrap this idea because battleships don't have the best place in EVE right now.\n\nI personally would rather do a hyperion which is much more suited to this.  it gets 5 mids and 6/7 lows IIRC and gets a HUGE repping bonus.  You can avoid the speed penalty of the plates entirely.\n\nDo 6 Neutron Blaster cannons in the highs, you'll notice you have one highslot left over, this is actually a missile launcher hardpoint believe it or not you can be a cheeky cunt and run a RLML or a torp launcher.\n\nMids do a scram, two webs, MWD, and a heavy cap booster, please bring Navy 800's because you'll need them to save space.\n\nBring 2500 Fed Navy Anti-matter and 2500 Null, bring 24 Cap booster 800's\n\nLows are a large ancil repper, a regular repper, The rest of the lows can be done two ways, you can either do some damage mods and some resist or you can do full resist, you might not have enough CPU for a full rac of hardeners so you should either do a flavor of each energized membrane or try and get adaptive nano membranes CPU permitting\n\nRigs are two nanopumps or a nano pump and a nanobot accelerator, third rig can be an explosive pump or what ever rig you want PG permitting, a collision accelerator can help a lot.\n\nThis hyperion is super hyper brawl and its practically unkillable because the rep amount is so stupidly high.\n\nFor your drones, do a flight of heavy drones because you'll be dual webbing shit the heavy drones should have no problem hiting small stuff.  this whole set up should do somewhere between 800 and 1000 DPS skills permitting.\n\n\n**TL;DR** Don't fly a mega, use a hyperion instead.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428614349", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So I'm literally going to break down your entire article and why it's riddled with flaws.\n\n1. Having a broad \"most\" successful champion doesn't make them an outlying success, it just means their average play across their champion pool is consistent. For bjergsen the only outlying example where his play is above and beyond most of his other picks is zed. If you're basing it purely on win-rates, then context here matters a lot in which you have given none. Going 5-0 vs. the bottom 5 teams is a different story from going 5-0 vs. the top 5 teams in the world.\n2. Lissandra isn't a flex pick anymore because of the nature of lane-swaps. Right now the best toplaners are able to essentially double jungle without needing to leach the main junglers xp. Lissandra cannot do this on top of that isn't exactly a good pick for Dyrus. For TSM to pick Lissandra would mean a bad draft phase.\n3. seeing a rek'sai top is so unlikely that it wasn't worth even putting in the article, is effectively pointless \"information.\"\n4. \"doesn't scale very well\"(in regards to sivir), now this is just false. Just because she isn't a hyper carry or a duelist doesn't mean her scaling is bad. Especially given another \"expected\" pick was corki. Sivir has immense utility in the current meta because she has a decent amount of self peel with the potential to force an engage. She won't kill the enemy ADC 1 v 1 but she makes her teams job so much easier.\n5. I have no idea what leads you to believe lustboy won't pick nautilus just because he hasn't yet... it might have something to do with the fact that TSM haven't had any games while nautilus has seen its most play. To think they haven't practiced with it is foolish. \n6. No Kalista for wildturtle? u wot? TSM like to lane swap and Kalista has a lot of problems in lane vs. things like graves, lucian. Expect to see late game hyper carries(trist, kog, jinx, kalista) out of wildturtle far more so than Corki, Lucian, Urgot.\n7. \"Bjergsen has been the best player in the NA LCS\", err you fucking wot m8? You literally can't compare apples to oranges to say he's outright the best is basically you saying oranges &gt; apples and this is the best orange and thus best orange = best fruit. No, that's not how you should write about a player. The objective is to *be* objective.\n\nAlthough you mention a lot of stuff you don't provide any context or even a reason as to why this even matters. As a writer you should include context as well as relevance in composition vs. composition. xiaoweixiao isn't exactly going to pick Yasuo vs. Bjergsens zed is he? In fact, if Xiaoweixiao picks Yasuo in this series it'd be a showcase of arrogance as opposed to a legitimate pick. TSM are more than likely going to try and pressure bans onto Rush, since his ability to play tank junglers is less than stellar compared to his carry style junglers, so forcing him back will allow lanes to be even without too much pressure from Rush. Twisted fate is a MUST mention in context of compositions, since if you give XWX a good matchup and is against a fairly squishy comp, he will pick TF and he will do work on it.\n\n\nIn regards to roles:\n\nImpact &gt; Dyrus\nRush ~~ Santorin (depends on the draft so heavily)\nXWX &lt; Bjergsen\nApollo &lt; Turtle\nAdrian &lt; Lustboy\n\nGiven both teams will likely lane swap, it relies heavily on the jungler pressure. XWX and bjerg are fairly closely skilled, so any slight intervention can tip the whole series. So TSM HAS to prioritize forcing rush into a less then comfortable state. If Rush gets comfortable and TiP ward efficiently around midlane and TiPs bot goes even, it's safe to say that TiP could take the series if they play against what they know TSM **has** to do. If Rush hasn't got some pocket picks and / or shows he can play the tankier junglers at a similar level to his carry junglers, it's a fairly likely 3-1 or even 3-0 for TSM. As much as the closely matched skill or Bjergsen vs. XWX is to watch, the real pressure lies on Santorin vs. Rush and Fly vs. Loco. Picks and bans are crucial.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428683336", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

The reason I didn't help you is because I told you to stop drinking and you told me to fuck off. I stopped you from getting the shit kicked out of you after you kicked in the gay couple's door, but you deserved it. I'm not your \"brother\", stop inviting me to shit.\n\nIf you're going to smoke cigarettes in your room, open your fucking window. I don't care how cold it is, there's a reason the walls in the hall are fucking YELLOW. I smoke weed in my room, but I *always* blow it out the window... you fuckin' savage.\n\nQuit being so fuckin' creepy, stop coming into my room unannounced without knocking and if you do it when I'm watching a movie or show with someone, then don't fucking talk the entire time throughout it or I'll show you how much of a \"fookin koont\" I can be. (This guy's Australian, pardon my French.)\n\nYou need to stop being so quiet and weird, and since you live right next to the common area, you have no right to be shitty toward me when I come home from work. Move in with your girlfriend/ex-wife so the rest of us can have a new, not-as-shitty housemate.\n\nI love you, and I love your cats, but your cats are fucking assholes. You need to brush them, change their litter box daily, and purge your room of all the things they pissed and shit on. I can smell your room from down the street when your windows are open. I took a shit and found your cats hair in my ass crack. I refuse to use that lint roller anywhere else!\n\nAnd as for you, if you have more loud conversations on the stairwell or blast classical music at 2:30 in the goddamn morning, I'm going to do more than just ask nicely next time. The next time I'm drunk at home and have to see you just walking around the house shirtless, I'm taking mine off too so you can check out my sweet mantits and feel just as awkward as I am.

This excerpt pertains to the \"World Record Event\" that occurred within the first quarter of the 22nd century.  Marshal Forty would live through that ancient record setting event, one of the lucky few for the Terran forces on that day.  An important first hand source for Historians, Grand Marshal Forty was felled 18 months after the date of this excerpt.  Forty, a most honorable e-bushido HA, was slain by iHacks as he defended a biolab full of TR defenseless peasants inept and shitters from the HIVE mongrel horde.

First our med kits stopped working, then our repair guns, followed by our heavy shields and then our reloads.

{"body": "**Up-N-Atom Burger, Vinewood Boulevard---April 14th 6:13 PM, 2013**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe price of two burger and two order of fries in that little burger joint down the road usually runs in at about $7.88. With the additional soda or two, the price tag suddenly runs up to a flat $10, which is usually more than Xia can afford, having just moved in to the city about a month or so back. Pisswater's actually pretty filling for the whooping $15 it steals from the wallet, though it washes down a lot better than soda and keeps a working man up at night for work.\n\nToday, Xia and his \"business associate\" Liam are enjoying some fine, greasy-coated burgers and salty-as-Africa potato fries. A fine meal in the name of the American spirit.\n\n\"So come on Xia, buddy. What do you think of the place so far?\"\n\n\"Ehh. LS is pretty nice so far, Liam. Decent money here and there. Say, you happen to know where to find a dayjob?\"\n\n\"What? Come on, the night shifts down at 24/7 ain't cutting it for you, nigga?\"\n\nA purple-coated man walks over, waving around a gun in his hand. Hearing the words, he runs right over and points the barrel at the skinny white Liam's temple.\n\n\"What'd you just say bitch?!\"\n\n\"No hablo ingles, lo siento putita. Puedo ayudarlo con buscar su padre?\"\n\nXia quickly picks up the mood and pulls Liam away. Pointing at the gun with a shaky finger, he adds \"Shi shi? Ni hao, gong hei fa choi-\"\n\nThe Balla raises an eyebrow and puts his gun away. Calling his brothers to his side, he leaves the restaurant with a little bag in his hand and a swagger in his steps. \"Lousy fucking Mexicanese ruining San Andreas...\"\n\n\"Jesus fooking Christ, can you believe that guy?\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have used that word, you know.\"\n\n\"What? It's not like we're on Grove Street getting fresh with those motherfuckers.\"\n\n\"Ehh, still.\" Xia takes a long sip from his little paper cup, swishing the bubbly brown E-cola around his yellowing teeth. \"Hey, got a light?\"\n\nThe little Chinaman pulls out a little pinch of bright-brown shavings and wraps it around in a little dark roll of paper, sticking it in his mouth. A flame is lit on a little white lighter which heats up the end with its warm glow. He inhales deeply before letting the ashen-tasting smoke cloud escape his mouth with a long drag. Thank god for Free Smoke in San Andreas.\n\nLiam pulls out his phone and checks the time. 6:23 PM. Only seven more minutes before it was time to start heading for work. He stuffs it away and crams the rest of his burger into his mouth, letting the mushy meat roll around his mouth as he talks.\n\n\"So, how was your morning man?\"\n\n\"Honestly, pretty shitty.\" His friend taps his long fingernails across the table, staring and admiring the little cigar between his fingers. \"That one uhh... black guy was driving a tank around my car again. I had insurance so I got covered for it but still, long walk to the train this morning.\"\n\n\"I hear ya. You know one of those uhh... fuck, who were those guys with the really gay looking black motorcycles around in Blaine County again?\"\n\n\"The Lost, I think. Wait, are you talking about the one with Johnny?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that coke-upped guy. Man, I was selling some cars down at the Bodyworks the other day and the guy struts on in with a completely torn apart motorcycle.\" Liam rips up a bag of salt and pours it all over the greasy fries, licking the white remains on his hand. \"And I mean fucking destroyed! Wheels popped, lights out, seat gone... half the goddamn handlebar was gone! And you know what he asked me?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He asked me to give him bullet-proof wheels and add a new horn. Didn't ask me to fix it. Just asked for a goddamn fucking horn and bullet-proof wheels.\"\n\n\"You mean, replace the popped ones with bullet-proof?\"\n\n\"No! He wanted me to make the broken tires bullet-proof! How in the fuck do you make popped tires fucking bulletproof?\"\n\n\"You're the mechanic not me.\" Xia pulls out his phone. The time was 6:30 PM. He picks up the emptied, ketchup-smeared tray and dumps in the trash can, feeling around his backpack. \"Well, see ya in two hours Liam. I've gotta get to work.\"\n\n\"Alright man. Hey, mind if I tag along?\" His friend grins, getting up and walking over to the nearest cash register, zipping open his own backpack and digging around for his materials.\n\n\"Pffft. Alright man. You're driving though.\"\n\n\"Do I get to do the thing?\" asks Liam as he wraps a white hockey mask around his head.\n\nXia pulls his hood over his masked head. \"Ehh. On the count of 3, we do it together.\"\n\n\"Alright, cool. 1, 2, 3.\"\n\n\"**EVERYONE PUT YOUR HANDS UP IN THE AIR AND HAND OVER THE MONEY!

{"body": "Okay my best which involved a friend (So technically it's his story)\n\nFugitive had just become a thing.  I IV-100 joined a Hoxton breakout already in progress eager to test my new Fugimind dual berreta SUPA SPEED build that several other people have been proclaiming as the greatest thing to be introduced to payday since HE rounds.\n\nHost was a I-90 ish person not new to the game but obviously kind of dumb.  The other two were random non-infamy.  Day one goes fine with luck (No SWAT van, first door we opened had computer) but the others were getting their face kicked in hard as I had to inspire up everyone at least twice and the host got within .05 seconds of going into custody after he took a face full of sniper and shotgun while being two streets over from us (He went back looking for ammo never mind he had ammo bags)\n\nDay 2 starts and one of the randoms crashes out so we stop on the join screen for day 2 and I stealth invite a friend to join us.  Now this friend was a V-100 and rocking that Deathwish mask and a dual shotgun overkill/bezerker techforcer build that let him one man army entire BRIGADES of the police by himself as that's important later on.  But he gets that empty slot and we run the mission as normal.\n\nAgain Day 2 is like day 1 except the random and the host are the ones going down and the random gets kicked for using his card on the medbay (Just because I only had cupcakes and he was on 3 downs how wasteful of him...)  so already we are a little annoyed with the host, poor guy worked hard he just was not playing the cover game enough.  \n\nFinal objective comes we have everything set to go, I have server my friend is pushing 200 kills (We are in the low 30s so beast he has been) and we get ready to go when things go wrong fast.  I and the random gets kicked from surprise cloakers and a pair of dozers recks shit.  The lobby is pretty much empty thanks to my friend murder spree and he doubles back, kills both dozers, picks me up and I inspire up the random and the host who tried to melee a dozer while a second dozer shot him down.  \n\nWe are halfway to the lobby when host goes down again after a grenade throw from me blows up 2 inches from his face (Protip 90% dodge chances does not affect your grenades) however host thinks it was random and WTF and kicks him.  I stop to say sorry (He was down and up inside five seconds) even as he kicks the random so I say WTF and ask why he kicked him.\n\nInstead of escaping a thirty second chat conversation is had between us as he said he kicked the random for using noob grenades and I saying WTF that was me and the he says oh and kicks me.\n\nNow this overkill projob Hoxton breakout is just my friend and the host.  The host charges forward and gets sniped down.  The AI's go down trying to pick him up and my friend starts steam chatting me as I'm sitting on Crime.Net being pissed\n\nFriend:He went into custody I have the server\n\nMe:He fooking kicked me that bastard\n\nFriend: I'm ten feet away from the escape zone\n\nMe:U not done?\n\nFriend:I'm waiting, I just told him because he kicked you and everyone is in custody the instant he kicks me he will fail the mission.\n\nFriend:Hold\n\nMe:What?\n\nFriend:He's swearing at me, he's not kicked me yet\n\nMe:So your in the garage with the server just hanging out?\n\nFriend: :)\n\nAccording to my friend it went on for about six minutes with the host yelling at him and him laughing and still padding his kill count still demanding he apologies to the people who had carried him.  After awhile \"connection was host was lost\"\n\nMeaning the host rage quit the entire game rather than just fail the mission.

{"body": "I once tried to explain this to some nationalistic shitcunt. Being any other nationality than American on this website will have people completely ignoring what you've said and spewing stereotypes. Every single fucking time. It's just unbelievable how hard some Americans find it to adjust to sharing online spaces with non-American English speakers. It can be summarised thusly:-\n\nEnglish - U wot m8, I'm so British I shit the queen, Rooty Tooty point and shooty green text, hook you in the gabba.\n\nCanadian - Sorry, so polite, eh? Tim Horton's\n\nAustralian - Throw another shrimp on the barbie, Knifey spooney\n\nFrench - Surrender, (leading to) White flag on the Moon, Hon Hon Hon \n\nGerman - Nazis, Nazis, Nazis \n\nIrish - Top o' the morning to ya, to be sure to be sure, alcoholics, I'm 1/27 Irish.\n\nScotland - Damn Scots they ruined Scotland, Scotch people, Scotts   (followed immediately by someone linking Scott's a dick from southpark), You are ruled by the English. \n\nThese are just the countries that are fortunate enough to be significant enough for the average American and therefore have stereotypes associated with them. God forbid you're from Wales, Northern Ireland, New Zealand or somewhere since then you'll just be treated like an alien for coming from somewhere they've never heard about.\n\nImagine if every time someone said \"Gotten\" or \"Center\" they were instantly barraged with a spam about Hamburgers, obesity, red necks and \"Murica\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429011937", "subreddit": "ShitAmericansSay", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Jaime Lannister is a fookin' legend. \n\n1) Had to cope with seeing &amp; experiencing a lot of shit at a young age. He was 16 &amp; having to watch Aerys burning people alive in front of him, all whilst knowing it might be him next if his father angered the King. Had to listen to Aerys raping Rhaella &amp; couldn't do anything about it. He had to be silent and ignore everything that Aerys was doing. Then he was faced with an impossible choice; Kill the King, break his vows, or stand by and watch as the whole city &amp; his father burnt. So he saved a city, and what does he get for it? Contempt from pretty much everyone he saved. Not only all this Mad King stuff, but was also in a toxic relationship with Cersei, who just brought him into that situation. Within his family, he grew up having to please everyone, because he was the only one that Cersei, Tyrion &amp; Tywin all loved, so he had to cope with their arguments &amp; hate.\n\n2) Despite what everyone says, he's got a pretty strong (albeit slightly warped) idea of honour and nobility. He killed Aerys, but would never go so far as to reveal why, further disgracing the King he swore to protect. As much as he disagreed with &amp; was disliked by Catelyn, he kept his oath to her, to find Sansa &amp; Arya. His honour has been questioned for so long, and its existence denied by so many, that he is desperate to prove his honour &amp; keep an oath completely. \n\n3) Let's face it, he's pretty fine. He's incredibly handsome and an accomplished knight, but he's also very witty and can be incredibly charming. Whilst he may seem cruel &amp; ruthless, he's incredibly motivated by his heart &amp; by love, even if that love is badly placed. If he cares for someone, his loyalty to them is incredible. He's lived with years of hidden self loathing &amp; loathing from others, so it's impossible not to feel a lot of sympathy for him, and even admiration. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429014464", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So super late to the party, but I saw elsewhere that you wouldn't mind a summary of all the games, so here goes. This is taken from manuals, in-game material, supplemental material, and Ray Bingham's (the series' writer and alter-ego of Ham Binger) forum posts.\n\n**Backstory**\n\n\nSo there's these two couples in the Garden of Eden, right? And one eats the fruit and the other doesn't. The couple that eats the fruit are the first Humans, while the couple that don't are the first Archons (who were originally called Highmen, btw. This was changed in AoW 2. No explanation was given but I suspect it's due to the unfortunate fact that Highmen is a homophone for a part of the female genitalia). This is important because Archons and Humans are tightly related.\n\n\nAnyway, the universe kind of revolves around three races: Archons, Humans, and Elves. The Archons go around making worlds, the Elves go around cultivating worlds, and the Humans go around living in worlds (like I said, Archons kinda see Humans as their little brothers, and want to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves).\n\n\nAnyway, on one particular world the Elves were cultivating, there was a dude named Inioch, who was the Wizard-King of the Elven Court which ruled over all the races there. Suddenly a weird-ass star appears in the sky and everyone's like \"Dag yo, what's up with that star?\" Turns out the star's a portal that the Archons use. They show up at Inioch's Court and were like \"This world is ballin, yo. It's gonna be perfect for the Humans. We want you cultivating our next world.\" And Inioch was all like \"Yeah, about that... I kinda like it here. Also, I mean, this is, like, totally embarrassing, and everything, but I kinda forgot to tell all the other Elves that we're actually just here to cultivate the world and need to step down when Humans get here.\" And the Archons were like \"Whatevs. Humans are coming no matter what. Stay or leave, but we recommend you leave.\"\n\n\nAnd, of course, the Elves don't leave. Oh, also important is that Inioch had a wife named Eleanor. She births a son named Meandor, but dies in the process. The day after the mourning period ends, Inioch takes a second wife, Elwyn, who gives birth to a daughter, Julia. Apparently having two kids is scandalous for Elves, so Inioch defends it by saying that Julia replaces the lost of Eleanor. Meandor is not amused by any of this.\n\n\nAlso, the Elves are like \"Dang I don't know who these Archons are but they seem pretty legit\" so they form a faction called the Keepers dedicated to pursuing peace with the Archons. The Archons don't really care.\n\n\nSo the Humans show up and immediately begin conquering everything in sight. They go through the Elves like a hot knife through butter. The Elven Court is sacked, the Elves are almost wiped out, and Inioch is killed. At this point, the High Elves are basically finished. Elwyn escapes with her infant child Julia, and she and the Keepers set up camp on the Isle of Aldor, literally on the opposite side of the continent from the Valley. The Keepers are all like \"Shit, that was some bad mojo. We should try and make peace with the Humans to make sure this doesn't happen again.\" They end up buddying up with the Wood Elves of Sylvanus and up until AoW 3 comes along any mention of Elves usually means Wood Elves.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Meandor and a bunch of other High Elves were like \"Aw hell no. Did you see what they did to us? Those bastards gotta pay.\" So they go underground and start getting all freaky with spiders and become the Dark Elves and form a group called the Cult of Storms, dedicated to wiping out the Humans and restoring the old order. They crown Meandor the King of the Blessed Continent, but no one else actually acknowledges or indeed, even pays any attention to this.\n\n\nThings go on for a few centuries, with the Humans gradually expanding more and more and the other races being like \"Huh. Well, this sucks.\" Most notable is that the Keepers' overtures for peace are utter failures because the Humans either don't know or don't care about the difference between Elves and Dark Elves, the latter of whom keep attacking Humans. Then the Azracs, a race of desert-people to the south, start freaking out like crazy. Turns out a Cult of Storms agent named Melenis (who, by the way, is married to Meandor) snuck into their vault and blew the Horn of the Dead. All of a sudden, every corpse on the continent rises again in a sort of zombie apocalypse. Except with skeletons instead of zombies. Of course, no one outside of the Cult knew this and everyone else blames the Azracs (and the fact that the Azracs ended up profiting massively from the Undead invasion doesn't do much to dissuade these rumours).\n\n\nAll the races of the world band together to fight the Undead, except the Dark Elves, who are like \"Screw you guys\" and hide underground, occasionally conquering whatever the Undead leave behind. The alliance can't win, though, and soon the Undead have the world on the ropes. Then the Archons are like \"Hey! What the hell is going on down there?\" and they show up and completely turn the tables and soon, while the Undead aren't destroyed completely, they're mostly contained.\n\n\nThe Undead are like \"Dag, yo. That's not working at all\" so instead they start to infiltrate necromancers into the Cult.\n\n\nEverything's peaceful for a while, but then that weird-ass star appears again and everyone's like \"Oh crap that's probably a bad omen.\"\n\n\n**AoW 1 Campaign**\n\n\nThe Cult of Storms sneaks onto Aldor and assassinates Queen Elwyn, then go off to besiege the United Cities - the Halfling capital. The Keepers are like \"u wot m8\" and pursue the Cult, lifting the siege. With Elwyn dead, Julia now leads the Keepers and she's like \"Okay the Cult has to pay for this\" but Melenis pops up again and is like \"lol diversion\" and creates a massive earthquake that nearly wipes out the entire Dwarvern race. The Keepers are like \"Well, shit\" and go help the Dwarves instead. Meanwhile, the Cult goes south and helps the Orcs fight the Azracs to preserve their alliance there. The Lizardmen try to align with both sides, and are both times ignored.\n\n\nSo remember how necromancers infiltrated the Cult? Yeah. They were like \"Hey, Meandor, you know how you want to restore the old order? You can't really do that without Inioch, right?\" and Meandor was like \"Huh, I guess not.\" So he goes to resurrect King Inioch, only he ends up botching it and accidentally causes Inioch to come back as some crazy genocidal lich king instead. Meandor's all like \"Huh. That's not what I wanted. You guys said it would resurrect him\" and the necromancers were like \"le epic trole xD\" and left the Cult to follow Inioch. Of course, when the Undead start moving in force again, the Archons poke their heads out and are like \"Look, I thought I told you to cut that shit out.\" Unknown to anyone except Inioch, however, the Archons are also coming to establish the Humans as the ultimate, dominant authority in the world once and for all.\n\n\nSo all four groups - the Keepers, led by Julia; the Cult, led by Meandor; the Archons, led by Gabriel, and the Undead, led by Inioch, converge on the Valley of Wonders. There's six possible endings here, but the canonical one is that Julia wins, Meandor and Inioch are killed, the Cult falls apart, the Undead threat ends, and the Archons are like \"Fine, if you want this world so badly? Keep it. This world is like a 6, anyway.\"\n\n\n**Between AoW 1 and AoW 2**\n\n\nSo Yaka, the wizard-king that the Azracs worship as a god, is super pissed off that the Azracs keep losing territory to the Orcs and Humans. So, he does the logical thing and completely wipes them out and instead replaces them with a race of catmen called Tigrans, who he feels will make a more suitable army.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Humans have been driven from the Valley of Wonders, and are like \"Huh. Now what're we going to do?\" Then they find this nice big fertile region with all sorts of rivers and freshwater lakes, and they're like \"Dude this is awesome.\" Then the Lizardmen were like \"Uh, we kind of live here, and we'll defend it to the last man, so unless you want a fight, you should go somewhere else\" and the Humans were like \"Uh, have you met us? Killing people and taking their land is kind of our thing\" and so the Lizardmen were all like \"Bring it!\" and so the Humans brought it and the Lizardmen were no more.\n\n\nSo the Humans established themselves there and they were like \"I don't know about you but I am bored as shit\" so they took up that classic sport, hunting dragons. At first the dragons were all like \"lol lesser races\" but then their numbers started dwindling very, very quickly. Eventually they seemed to realize that hiding out in caves lying on top of treasure hordes wasn't a very good survival strategy so they petitioned some higher powers (in this case another wizard-king) to take their young and turn them into half-dragon, half-human creatures called Draconians. It happens and now the dragons have someone to defend them.\n\n\nCenturies pass and the Wizard-Kings start doing weird shit and suddenly there's this massive apocalypse rocking the world. Julia's like \"Dag yo, I can't do anything to stop this. I need to get in on this Wizard-King action\" and so she does.\n\n\n**CONTINUED BELOW**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429121375", "subreddit": "AOW3", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry if I come off as rude, but I disagree with this ranking. Yara is a better fighter than Theon, since she is actually a fighter, as much of S2 was spent showing. Khal Drogo is up too high. He is basically a weaker, albeit faster, Mountain with no armor. That's short work for a trained knight. I get that Brienne did beat the Hound, but that's a Hound who was crippled immensely by a nasty infection. I think a S1 Hound would have beaten her. Jon Snow 14th, and the Fookin Legend of Gin Alley 20th? When they fought, Tanner had the upper hand. Grey Worm is a great soldier, not a great warrior. He is very well trained, but that training is 99% for having at least dozens of other Unsullied beside him. Tormund is strong, fast, and ferocious, but poorly armed, trained, and armored. Ser Loras in his standard equipment could stomp him. Daario is relatively unproven compared to some of the others below him. Oberyn is very good, but his style against the Mountain was largely effective just because The Mountain was slow and quick to tire. A more disciplined fighter like Barristan or Jaime would have exploited his lack of strength compared to them and still been fast enough not to fall to the same attacks as Gregor did. Lastly, and most importantly: Jaime. Ser Jaime Lannister is one of the best fighters Westeros has ever seen. He could roflstomp half the people on this list and not even pull out of Cersei doing it. He may have lost to Brienne in, really, his only fight of the series, but that was after being tied up in a small cell for months. Think of how baby cows are unable to walk on their own because of their preparation for being vealed. 8th place? Behind Daario? S1 Jaime could easily beat 60 year old Barristan, much as I love the old guy. Jaime should be number 1. \n\nEdit: went back and read the whole post. Not mad at you, OP, just saying that I disagree, which you have valiantly accepted as inevitable. Also, what you wrote does cancel out much of what I said. Hopefully, some people will read this and it will influence their voting so that I am proven right. Very much looking forward to seeing how this turns out, and nice job setting all this up.

{"body": "I'm sure I'm gonna get shit for this, but:\n\nI dunno, let's be objective here, man.  DM was streaming when this thing happened.  You can bet if I was streaming I likely wouldn't watch a video.  I'd be even less inclined if someone in my chat were to be like, \"LOOK THIS VIDEO IS ABOUT YOU\" because yes, that has flags of drama all over it. \n\nAs far as the botter thing, it doesn't really seem to make sense, but in the context that he's streaming, and he has people in his chat talking about an incident where Lass said he was a botter, it makes sense to bring up.  Twitter is a limited number of characters, and it's hard to get a point across - sometimes you need to do a little translating when people get in arguments.\n\nHow this reads to me is:\n\nL: \"Hey DM don't ban people in chat talking about my video for bringing it up.\" \n\nD: \"I don't support drama in my chat, I didn't watch whatever this video was, but people are only asking about this stuff to get a rise out of us.\"\n\nL: \"It's not drama, watch it if you respect me.  If you don't, then I'll remember it.\"\n\nD (thinking it's about this bot accusation issue that came up recently): \"All I know is that you claimed I botted, that's dumb.\"\n\nL: \"This is something else, don't disregard it.\"\n\nD: \"Again, have no idea what it is, all I know is that you apparently called me a botter behind my back.  That's a lie.\"\n\nL: \"This vlog doesn't talk about botting. If you're a big part of the community you need to act like one, otherwise you're an elitist\" (what?)\n\nD: \"All I know is you talk behind my back and I don't condone that.  Do whatever you want.\" (Again, what?  There's a disconnect here and there's no reason to repeat it.)\n\nL: \"U WOT M8?  I'll REK U\"  (And this is where it gets whoah, wtf).\n\nRegardless of how you look at it, this conversation in and of itself just doesn't make sense.  There's no right side here - DM probably should have backed off around the time Lass said it wasn't about the bots.  Lassiz's tweet about being an elitist is just weird and out of context, and the way he reacted to DM saying \"you do you\" in response literally took the conversation from like a 3 to a 10.  It didn't need to go there at all.  Edit: I should also say - clearly Lass recognizes that this was a mistake, as he made an apology for it.  You don't apologize if you don't think anything you did was questionable.\n\nThat said, the thread continues with fans saying absolutely ridiculous things and lassiz calling them white knights (which he also shouldn't be doing). They have a point.  When you talk about being a professional and immediately follow it like that, you ARE somewhat discrediting yourself.  Granted, the guy calling Lass an alcoholic is fucked up as well and really just shouldn't be throwing stuff like that in. \n\nEveryone needs to take a step back in this situation honestly.  Criticizing someone is fine.  If you don't like their work, fine.  If you don't like that they're the face of the community, work toward promoting different faces (like Lassiz, for example, if you like him).  You want to force a change in their professionalism and/or get HiRez to stop promoting them?  Fine, do that through proper avenues.  But don't whine and propagate internet arguments between figureheads, and then join in like you're a cheerleader or something.  It's not fucking healthy for anyone to do that.  \n\nPeople want him removed from HiRez promotion because apparently he makes the community look so bad - but honestly in cases like this, the community does a fine job of making itself look bad.  Too many people here are letting emotion guide their actions.  Like holy shit, be objective here.  Hell, if all these people agree with lass' video, why are they basically going \"Yeah Lass! Fuck DM up cause he's so BM!\"  They're literally becoming part of the problem he's talking about.  =/  This whole thing has just gotten disappointing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429281881", "subreddit": "Smite", "score": 11, "controversiality": 1}

Kevan destroyed Cersei before leaving, Sam made fun of Janos in the election scene, and we got Lyanna Mormont, the fookin legend of Bear Island.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere was a lot of strange stuff, like Brienne having another chance encounter with a Stark child. And Littlefinger didn't even care that she was able to recognize Sansa, it looks like they completely abandoned that. Then there's Ellaria wanting to kill people and deciding that she wants to send bits of Myrcella back to Cersei. And in Season 4 Oberyn told Cersei \"We do not hurt little girls in Dorne\" yet here's his paramour seeking to do the exact opposite. At least Doran seems to be logical. They condensed the Wall plot a lot, but I guess that's alright. My biggest problem with this episode is probably Dany. \"Let's give this Harpy a fair trial even though as far we know he has literally done nothing except be found with a mask. Now let's kill this guy for supposedly killing that guy, publicly, without any semblance of a trial.\" I can't believe Hizdahr actually gave sound advice when he said that Dany should have just killed Mossador inside the pyramid. I mean what was she expecting? The *hiss* from the freedmen was pretty cool though.\n\nAlright episode, lots of confusion, but lots of stuff all around. 7.5/10", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429495774", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 56, "controversiality": 0}

I'm pretty excited for all of the combined plots and characters.\n\nLow:\nThe whole Lord Commander election plot was really rushed.  There's 'condensed', and there's 'rushed', and this was rushed.  I get that Jon was like 2 books behind all the other main characters, but that's what happens when you waste a whole season chasing the legend of fookin gin alley just to make the battle line up with the end of the season.  They should have at least had Stannis offer to legitimize Jon in episode 1, so we had some time to let that sink in.  It was all of thirty seconds from the offer to \"Not doing that\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429496651", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 67, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1) THE FUNNY MAIN AIN'T AFRICAN HES MEXCIAN. GET YOUR FOOKIN FACKS STRAIGHT!\n\n2) Deuce was hit by a car before Swan Songs was released. They never replaced him but they had Shady Fizz sing the choruses and Funny Man get the bitches and pizza.\n\n3) Johnny 3 Turds.\n\n4) The age limit is 2+, so no, you don't have to be 18. \n\n5) Their masks have deeper meanings:\n\nCharlie's mask represents his past lifestyle as a gangster, where he would hold up 7-11's with some dude named Kevin, flash his weenie to the cashier and hypnotize them, take the money, and then go to another 7-11 to buy some 40's with the spare change.\n\nDa Kurlzz's mask represents his secret sexuality. The smiling side is his homo side. The frowny side is his straight side. There's two sexualities fighting in his mind and he can't figure out if he should reveal his feelings to Charlie or continue to fuck 50 girls a week. Some little trivia - his Notes from the Underground mask had red on the frowny side because sometimes he gets mad when he can't fuck 50 girls because they're on their periods.\n\nDanny's mask represents how he hated that bastard C-3PO growing up. He loved Star Wars, but that piece of metal shit made him feel weird. So, he has a bullet on the one side of his mask to show how he wishes he can shoot C-3PO in the eye. His new mask from Day of the Dead has a bunch of sparkle things on it. This is foreshadowing what the big screens will look like after Danny tears them apart at the showings of The Force Awakens this Christmas.\n\nFunny's is black because ppl thought he was black.\n\nJ-Dog's mask shows how he once had to sneak into a burning building to get a dollar. He donned a gas mask and ran inside, hoping to find this 100 dollar bill his friends told him was inside. When he went in, he grabbed the dollar bill. He was burnt and bleeding like hell. When he got outside he was so happy...until he realized the dollar was only a 1 dollar bill and not 100. So, he screamed \"The city looks so pretty, do you wanna burn it with me?\" and threw his friends in the burning house. Now he keeps the dollar bill on his face at all times to remember the friends lost on that day. Their names were Aaron and Jeffery. \n\nFinally, Johnny's mask represents how he takes ecstasy every night and has wet dreams of beastiality. See, the blue of his mask represents the wetness of his dreams. His \"sailor\" outfit from American Tragedy represented seamen/semen. The cracked feature on his Notes mask represented the chafes his penis would get after jerking it every night. The three on the side represents the three main things Johnny loves to dream about fucking - the world, Charlie, and butterflies. Yes, the beastiality he wishes to commit is with butterflies. He wants to grab that butterfly, snap its wings off, ride it into the sky, and have a sixsome with it until everyone's dicks cum, even the butterfly. \n\nI hope this helped you out, my good sir!

And second, it would have been louder if it was Dylan, as he's closer to the microphone - in the video he says it directly into the microphone, which doesn't make sense because it's not amplified. To my recollection none of the other band members had vocals on the songs, so no microphones, which is why the Audio is slightly more faint than when Dylan says \"You're a liar, etc\".

The kid, misinterpreting the warning as an instigation and apparently not seeing the benefit in avoiding a pissing contest with a crazy monkey, decided to up the ante by issuing his own 'fight' signal. \n\nThe aggressive hand gesture might not seem like much, but I'd guess monkeys and humans are similar enough for the message to be interpreted as the kid's *second* aggressive move. Clearly having no more of this bluffing shit, the monkey then demonstrates how easily it could eat the kid's face if it wanted to.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429809980", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 43, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;And other than those listed above, are there any other games or series that are worth trying?\n\nSince you own 360 and PC - I'm assuming you know of Dark Souls? If you enjoyed those games - check out \n\n* **Demon's Souls**\n\nIt's totally worth it. And if you haven't yet tried any of the games in the series but are interested - still go with Demon's Souls. There's still plenty of people playing it, and it is a great game.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n___\n\nInto driving games at all? \n\n* **Gran Turismo 6**\n\nThe game has flaws (half the cars look like ASS, all the cars sound like ASS and AI is ASS and there are no standing starts like in Forza) but it's still hundreds of hours of entertainment. Best selection of tracks of any game (IMO ofc). And it's still being updated with Vision GT cars released frequently and new seasonal events every so often. And GT academy is here as well.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n___\n\nDo you like FPS? There are plenty of great multiplatform shooters, but there are two exclusives that deserve your attention (if you're into single player FPS that is, cause I doubt anyone plays these online)\n\n* **Resistance**\n\n* **Killzone**\n\nIdeally I'd recommend playing all the games in the series (except Killzone 1 which is a ps2 game) but if you can play only 1 per franchise - go with 2. Resistance 2 is the best of the series, as is Killzone 2. \n\n___\n\n___\n\n___\n\n\nAnd last of the detailed suggestions (and the one I recommend THE MOST out of all the things I list):\n\n* **inFAMOUS**\n\nTo put simply - this is my favorite game series on playstation consoles today. Extremely fun, challenging yet fair (on hard difficulty) and interesting to play through. While the story may not be the strongest aspect of the first game - in inFAMOUS 2 it's freakin' amazing. Check out some gameplay footage for these games, and if it looks fun to you - it is! Swer on me mum.\n\n\n___\n\n___\n\n___\n\n\nHere's an assortment of other PS3 exclusives that I would recommend. It's up to you to check out what the games are about and decide whether or not you wanna play them:\n\n* **Heavy Rain**\n\n* **Journey**\n\n* **3D dot Game Heroes** (if you like old zelda games at all)\n\n* **God of War** (The first two games are available remastered. Highly recommend playing all of them).\n\n* **Tokyo Jungle**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429825820", "subreddit": "PS3", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Diesel flashes around about 50-100C depending on brand according to Wikipedia. Meanwhile, transmission fluid flashes at 200C+.

Plenty of people watch it and laugh. Its the exact same shit as your spliced run, same exact choppiness and everything. No mic, no cam, streamed with no viewers so that you wouldn't have to do anything they asked, like play a level you didn't prepare a splice for.\n\nLots of people have seen it; anyone who has ever asked about the proof. Nobody thinks you explicitly proved otherwise (Except Yuecchi, but that is understandable). You never proved anyone wrong, about anything. It was better when you went out in a blaze of anger and denial, this is just sad now\n\nEdit: Of course, if you care to do it again with mic and cam without 2 days of splicing preparation first, we're all willing to oblige lol. Just drop by IRC in the next little bit and have some people watch live, and go ahead and play the levels they ask you to play.

Yes, Grace was a spy. Yes, she sold the Blinders out. Why? It was her fookin job. Grace has her own story and  motivations and does not function as a standalone love interest. She spied for Campbell because she was motivated by revenge against the IRA and hatred towards those that step outside the law. She thought the lot of them were utter scum. In the end, she sold the final piece to secure Campbell's word that Tommy would not be harmed. She trusted this man's word, she had no idea she couldn't. He had not given the slightest indication otherwise. She has her story and her motives. \n\n3. Aunt Pol vs. Grace. That would be conflict, quite explosive conflict at that, and as you pointed out, conflict drives Peaky Blinders. Wouldn't see why this would be a reason against the marriage and as we've seen several times before, while Tommy does listen to Pol, he doesn't always do what she tells him to. Especially not matters directly related to him. \n\n4. Could be navigated across, simply by Grace admitting to adultery.  The banker would probably not want to be Karenin to Grace's Anna Karenina because everyone knows what happens there. She wouldn't have anything grave to fear by admitting adultery if she were to seek some kind of separation from him to be with Tommy, it's not the middle ages so she won't be stoned to death. \n\n5. \"There's business, and there's love.\" Depending on how you read into Tommy's character, this takes different meanings. Yes, he is brutally practical and does what needs to be done. However, one of his other defining characteristics is his concept of family. He always looks out for them, brings them in, integrates them. If the baby is his, this definitely pulls at his strong attachment to family. \n\n6. This depends. As I pointed out before, Pol would be less than thrilled and so will the rest of the family, so I do believe Grace would have to deal with quite a bit of conflict and withstand possible plots to throw her out. I do believe that the baby would move the show in a different tone with the implications and decisions it brings into the family unit moreso than the marriage - in particular the reason you picked at 2. She had sex with tommy and proceeded to tell him that she was trying for a baby. Why did she want a Shelby child? What endgame is she trying to angle at from within the family? Does she even want marriage?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430011819", "subreddit": "PeakyBlinders", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Sumner Crakehall**\n\n\nSumner was sitting down at the table in his tent. He took a bite out of a sweet, ripe plum. The juices of the plum ran down his beard. A guard pushed the tent open. \n\n“*My lord, a scout from Lord Addam Marbrand.*” \n\n“*Send him in, boy.*” Sumner responded.\n\nA frail boy with shaggy red hair walked in. Sumner Crakehall looked down at the boy. “*What’s your name?*”\n\n“*Alyn, my lord.*” he said, softly. \n\n“*Alyn, what. Speak up.*”\n\nAlyn Marbrand stiffened his back and stood up as straight and proud as he could. “*Alyn Marbrand my lord. I bring message from my brother, Addam, Lord of House Marbrand and Ashemark.”*\n\n“*Alyn Fuckin’ Marbrand. Well, you did a damn fine job bringing me this. Go fetch yourself an ale and some food from the camp. If anyone gives you a hard time tell them Lord Sumner gave you his blessing. Now, out of my tent.*” Sumner gave a dismissive wave toward the young Marbrand. \n\n“*Guard - fetch Podrick. We must discuss plans.*”\n\nThe Crakehall guardsman scurried off to find Podrick. Sumner surveyed the scroll in front of him. His body and his face grew old, but his mind was as alive and sharp as ever. Sumner had always had a strong grasp on martial strategies. He peeled the wax insignia of House Marbrand off the scroll and unrolled it.\n\n\n&gt;“**Lord Sumner**,\n\n&gt;**I hope my message finds you well. We have news on the rioters - they’ve been tracked just East of Lannisport and plan to attack any time. The Kennings are going to form up Southeast of Lannisport to flank the rioters as they march on Lannisport. They have 1500 infantry lined up ready to form a wall to contain and block any rioters that attempt to escape. House Marbrand has a host of roughly 750 mounted knights that will swoop in from the North to inflict mass casualties and chaos in their ranks.** \n\n&gt;**Addison Vance has brought his host of Riverlanders down to aid us in this conflict. He has 1000 men between you and the raiders. My recommendation from my intelligence is for you to meet up with Vance and provide support.**\n\n&gt;**Signed,**\n\n&gt;**Lord Addam Marbrand**”\n\n\nSumner sighed. “*Now I take commands from some freshly minted lordling. How delightful.*” The tent opened and the portly Podrick Crakehall shuffled in. “*Sumner, you have news?*”\n\n“*Aye. We march East - the rioters have been spotted between us and Lannisport. Addam Marbrand, the little lordling, has requested we link up with House Vance, some bloody Riverlord and provide support. The only time I’ll provide “support” for another commander is if he’s the fookin’ Lion himself. I’ll meet with this Lord Vance, but I’ll march our troops right past him and put down this pathetic uprising myself.*”\n\nPodrick seemed a bit taken aback - he had never seen Sumner lose his cool like this, not since their childhood. \n\n\n“*Podrick. Send a scouting party to locate these rioters for ourselves. When we know where they are with certainty and with our own scouts eyes, we will set up camp just out of eye shot. Prepare the men to march. We will show these rioters what the true wrath of the Westerlands are.

A young boy, tall with sores on his face, ran over from the other side of the tent. “Yes Lord Sumner?*” \n\n“*Ready my armor.*” He unsheathed *Tusks Embrace* and felt the edge. “You may yet taste blood again by my hand,” he said, talking to his blade. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430068234", "subreddit": "IronThronePowers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Sumner’s Charge**\n\nThe host of Crakehall men rode to the Northeast. The thunder echoed of footsteps of thousands of men marching and horse’s hooves striking the lush grass. They had been marching for 10 hours now. \n\n\n\n“*Lord Sumner, the rioters are just over the horizon. This is where we should camp.*”\n\n\n\nSumner recalled Lord Vance - he was told that he should have encountered their men on their march. \n\n\n\n“*Scout, what of Addison Vance’s men? Has there been any sighting?*” \n\n\n\n“*My lord, we detected Lord Vance’s camp a few leagues to the North. We’re about halfway between the Kenning and Vance Men.*”\n\n\n\n“*Good. Send a message to Lord Vance, Lord Kenning and Lord Marbrand that we are providing another front to the Southeast. Tell the troops to set camp here.*”\n\n\n\n“*Pod, at nightfall we will march. I will lead the van. You will march with the infantry. Keep them disciplined. I will take our 250 cavalry and charge into their back. Follow our charge and clean up whatever is left. Ready the men.*”\n\n\n\n*”Sumner, are you sure you are capable to lead the vanguard after your health scare the other day? You should stay behind and command.*”\n\n\n\n“*Have I ever stayed behind and commanded from a map and a goblet of wine? Piss off on the stay behind. I will ride.*”\n\n\n\nThe day wore on and the sun began to set. Sumner was fully armored. His plate armor didn’t shine as bright as the typical King’s Landing knight. There were scratches and small dents. The fierce  Sumner could have had these blemishes repaired. Sumner kept these imperfections as a reminder to himself that no one is invincible. The brown boar stood strong and proud on his breastplate. \n\n\n\nPodrick walked into the tent. His cloak was extravagant, made of the finest silk in the Seven Kingdoms. “*It is time, Sumner. Shall we ready the men?*”\n\n\n\n“*Aye.*” \n\n\n\nSumner placed his helm over his head and walked out of his tent. He approached *Challenger*, his warhorse. Challenger was well armored himself, with a skirt of steel and leather around his body. Sumner’s hip popped as his swung himself up on the horse. Podrick’s son, Arlan Crakehall, ran over to provide stabilizaiton but he was waved him off with a quick “*Piss off Arlan*”. \n\n\n\nThe men were lining up. 2,000 Crakehall men, all with their banners raised for a bunch of bloody peasants. Sumner couldn’t believe his eyes. This army was trained to dispatch heavily armed, trained armies. Not some rabble with pickaxes and leather jerkins. This battle was likely going to be even easier than putting down the rabid dogs that were the pathetic Iron Islanders.\n\n\n\n“*Men - we march to bring justice. These men, these criminals, slayed Lord Marbrand. They disobeyed your Lord Paramount’s judgement and took arms against the West. We show no mercy. If these peasants surrender, spare their life, but as long as a sword or a spear is in their hands, show no mercy. Make them wish they were back in the mines of Castamere. Make the fields of Lannisport red with their blood!*”\n\n\n\nA roar erupted from the Crakehall horde. “*NONE SO FIERCE!*” Sumner bellowed and crushed Tusks’ Embrace against his shield. “*WE MARCH!”*\n\n\n\n250 heavy cavalry enveloped Lord Sumner. Sumner glanced up at the skies. The stars were shining bright as if the Seven themselves were smiling on Sumner. He felt his horses body swaying back and forth as he rode forward. He glanced backwards and saw the lines of Crakehall troops marching by foot behind them. “*Lord Sumner, fires and camps ahead. The rioters drink and laugh, unaware at the death coming to them*”\n\n\n\n“*Halt the march.*” Sumner ordered. He didn’t want to be the first to engage. He wanted some sort of sign. \n\n\n\nThe sound chaos began to erupt from the camp. Sumner saw the silhouette of horses and knights running through the camp off of reflections from campfires. A warhorn’s sound erupted. \n\n\n\n“*THAT’S OUR SIGN MEN! RIDE! CHARGE!*” Sumner unsheathed Tusk’s Embrace and pointed towards the camp. The 250 riders charged towards the camp. Glints of orange flew from Sumner’s right and into the camp. “*Fire arrows. An intimidating choice, especially at night. A bold little Riverlord.*” Sumner concluded. \n\n\n\nThe world slowed down. It happened every time for Sumner. You can Joust, you can Melee, you can do anything in the realm and nothing compares to war. It’s not an emotion that you can replicate easily. His heartbeat remained steady. His pupils dilated. The roar of the horses faded to silence. \n\n\n\nThey were upon them. Prisoners staggered, clearly inebriated from their evening of debauchery and alcoholism. Tusk’s Embrace split his abdomen cleanly, revealing the pink intertwined innards all living things have. A knight beside him was unhorsed by a flaming arrow striking him in the neck. This happens in every battle. As a warrior, you dream of dying with your sword in hand by a man who’s skill with a sword is greater than your own. Far too often it’s by your own ally. It’s a sick twist on reality, and one that often goes unsaid. An embarrassing death. \nSumner saw another Crakehall knight catch a Rioter with his morning star, crunching and pushing his skull into his head. *Challenger* rode into a group of rioters, running aimlessly in a disorganized manner. They heard Sumner’s horse and turned to face him. They held long spears. “*Death to Tywin Lannister!*” \n\n\n\n*Challenger* did not slow and barreled right into the rioters. The spears punctured his skirt and stabbed him in his chest and he went crumbling down to the grass. Sumner was thrown from his saddle. He tried to call out to his allies, but the impact of hitting the ground knocked the air out of his lungs.\n\n\n\nA man with a short sword walked over to Sumner and laughed. “Some fookin’ lord this twat is. I’m going to open him up and give him a cunt for us to fuck.*” He laughed. “*How’s this for a cunt?*” Sumner said. Tusk’s Embrace flashed and there was only a spray of red where his head was. \n\n\n\nThree rioters rushed in at Sumner as Sumner remained on one knee. A man with blonde hair and thick beard rushed in with a pickaxe. He was closing in on Sumner. Sumner raised his shield, expecting the incoming blow. \n\n\n\nA spear from horseback penetrated the rioter’s chest, knocking him back six feet. Sumner bashed the second rioter in the face with his shield and pivoted to parry the blow from the third rioter. The third rioter wasn’t where he had expected. Sumner’s leg gave in and he collapsed and he felt warmth run down his leg. He tried to stablizie himself, but his leg wouldnt stand. He fell back down to a knee. \n\n\n\nThe third rioter found his arm, his sword glinting off his armor. Sumner cleaved Tusks’ Embrace in his direction and caught him in the chest, splitting him open. Sumner stood back up. Challenger was dead. The Knights of Crakehall were continuing to sweep through the camps, but it seemed to be lost that their Lord was unhorsed and alone. \n\n\n\nFour rioters came out from the nearby tent to Sumner’s right. They were wearing chain armor, most likely from the Marbrand men that they killed escaping from Castamere. \n\n\n\nThe first one couldn’t have been twenty yet. “He’s not much older than Lyle” Sumner realized. He parried his blow and bashed his face in with the sharpened hilt of *Tusks Embrace* The second man was a little hefty, probably 250 pounds. He wasn’t the strong type of hefty. He swung wildly at Sumner’s chest. Sumner deflected the blow to the ground and send *Tusks Embrace* deep into his fat-ridden belly. His sword was caught between the fat and his ribs. Sumner couldn’t kick the rioter off his blade due to his injured leg. The third rioter, probably 30 or so and wielding a longsword swung for Sumner’s arm. Sumner released his grasp of *Tusks Embrace* and staggered back. He drew his dirk. The rioter took a wide swing towards Sumner’s neck. Sumner threw his shield up to deflect the blow. He threw his dirk towards the rioter. \n\n\n\nThe seconds took minutes. He saw his dirk spinning in the air towards the rioter. The rioter saw it coming at the last second and moved his head. The steel cut his ear clean off. He kicked down on the 80 year old Sumner Crakehall, immobilizing him. Sumner fell to his back and spit at the rioter. \n\n\n\n“*Any last words old man?*”\n\n\n\n“*None so fierce*” Sumner said, matter of factly, as he sent his shield into the rioter’s knee, breaking his leg. The rioter screamed in agony and sent his blade deep into Sumner’s neck. Blood rushed into his mouth and down his throat. He gasped for air, but there was none to be had. He saw the rioter’s eyes staring down at him as things went faint and began to fade. His coughing was violent, spurting blood out of his mouth. A flaming arrow struck the earless rioter in the chest and felled him. For the Lord of Crakehall, all faded to black.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430088920", "subreddit": "IronThronePowers", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

You prefer Conquest driving in circles to a game with actual depth?  I don't think you even bothered to play BF4.  Maybe it was just too complex for your fragile young mind.  This alone is a dead giveaway that you are a liar and a troll.  \n\nI am fascinated that you would go to the point of lying so much in an attempt to win an argument online.  There is literally nobody on the face of the planet who does any sort of programming or software engineering who would not be able to see how stupid consoles are.  Unless you are re-building 486 machines that you got from good will, there is literally no reason why anybody with any sort of technological know how would stoop to the level that you claim to experience entertainment at.  That is like a professional marathon runner training inside of a closet.  Also, you should probably stop paying money monthly to play console games online, and trade that shit in to buy a computer worth a shit, because clearly you have not experienced gaming on a proper personal computer.  If you had ever bothered to put anything of worth into any of your p.c.s, you would have realized that the entire experience of gaming on a personal computer is better.  Period.  \n\n\"I myself have many PCs and had been a long time gamer on PC before I just got fed up with the constant issues of people like you online.\"\n\nYeah okay.  So you literally stopped playing PC games because somebody had an opinion other than your own on an internet forum?  That didn't take much.  That is like saying you stopped going to the gym because somebody honked their horn at you at a red light.  Get it?  There is no connection between the two.  You have proven my point that you lack proper judgement, social skills, patience, and that as a consumer you are a moron.  I bet you had to wipe the doritos crumbs off of your fingers to type your last post.\n\nAnd I'm sorry that unless you are in your 40's, you are not older than me.  Did you play Doom over LAN?  Did you play Quake online, and then switch to Quakeworld (Which is still played)?  Did you play TES Arena?  Daggerfall?  Starcraft Brood War on ICCUP?  Maybe on Fish?  C.S. 1.3?  1.6?  Were you playing RTCW online?  Did you play Enemy Territory?  Too old for you kid?  Okay, maybe you played some Halo on Xbox 360.  Does that go back far enough for you?  At that point I was beta testing Quake Live.\n\n\"And the kids who figured they could simply buy aimbots to win their way to the top.\"\n\nI'm sorry that you got dunked on by some kids online, but if getting outplayed made you want to switch entertainment formats, then maybe you should be looking at other issues that you might have.  There are cheaters everywhere in life.  You cannot stop playing the game because somebody doesn't play fair.  You just have to get better.  I would recommend taking a break from gaming if you are getting so angry that you have to switch formats every time you find a cheater, because consoles are very expensive.\n\n\"And if by some odd chance you are old enough to be out of diapers then I still would imagine I was likely creating games on my PCs while you were playing on your Nintendo or Atari?\"\n\nYeah okay.  You just decided to stop playing games on PC because why?  You threw away a valuable skill and craft.... why?  Because you are full of shit that is why.  There is literally no reason to lie on the internet.  But if it makes you feel better, then it makes you feel better.  I am really sorry that your life has gotten to this point, and I sincerely hope you make it out of whatever emotional rut you are in.\n\n\"I am retired, but still young enough...\" Yeah okay.  Retired and spending all of your time on Reddit, talking shit to people online, defending an inferior experience that you KNOW is a rip off.  You might as well have started that sentence with 'U wot m8.'  I hope your parents realize one day just how much money they have wasted on your Xbox live account and cancel that shit.  I hope they also realize what a little lying shit you are, and take away your plebstation.  Also, if you could keep your perverted daydreams to yourself that would be great.  If your parents found out you were talking like that to adults online, they would probably ground you.  And then no Xbox for you!!!\n\n\"So why again are you here on this subreddit if you hate BFH so much?\"\n\nI am here because I want my voice heard.  Because I feel ripped off that I purchased an incomplete product with no support.  I also know that the developers frequent this forum, so maybe they will see it.  Just because there is a subreddit for a topic does not mean that I have to agree with everything about said subreddit's subject.  I don't think you understand how democracy and reddit works.\n\n\"I have fun playing the games I play... seems to me you have fun complaining about games not living up to your expectations? Sorry, but I would rather be in my shoes right now then yours.\"\n\nDo you think it is fun to spend $120.00 on a game that sucks?  I don't.  That is why I am on reddit complaining.  Because this game sucks, and I want my fucking money back.  \n\nI want to thank you for taking so much of your time to sit down and think of a long, elaborate, drawn out story to tell somebody on the internet, that unfortunately won't be read by very many people.  I think if you were to lay off the Mountain Dew, you would sleep better at night.  You might need the rest to pursue a career in young adult fiction, which you are clearly on your way to.

I honestly did my best to research everything in-depth about the case. There is a 15 page document somewhere on my computer with all the evidence we compiled with arguments for and against her. At a certain point, it was just too much personal information diving which made us uncomfortable pursuing it any further. Ultimately, the problem was questioning her legitimacy as a person and player, not looking up her past job history and verifying financial transactions. There was also no lying in our statement -- we tried to look for a solution, but she decided to walk away. Swear on me mum.\n\nI think what is sad about the whole situation is that there is someone who is legitimately very good at Hearthstone, but she (or potentially he) has been pushed out of the scene due to shady behavior.\n\nI try to reach out once in a while and chat, but I haven't talked to her since early March-ish.

I canny remember his name no more, Mery... I kanny 'member. Smart man he was. Knew the holy book well, memorised the whole thing. Sweet 'nd juicy they were. Those oranges... Sour sometimes. He told us once about the war when he got drunk. He used to be someone from a shithole like this. Goes to war tells us how he'd be a squire and falls asleep. Didn't look to good saying it. Must've drunk too much. He left the next day, haven't heard the rest of the story.\n\nSo I think to myself if he could become a squire why not me? I was stupid like that when I was young. Off to war I go almost got slaughtered in my first battle. One of me friends dieds with his guts out. Other of te shitter. I cursed the septon and got away from there. Run back home. I did not run far. They caught me close to my village. Wanted to hang me. But guess what bloody bastard was there? The same fookin septon with his bloody oranges. I curse him spat on him and he just gimmes me and orange. And laughs. I think to meself I'll kill this bastard before I die. The stranger may take me. But he tells me the rest of the story instead. His brothers and friends were slaughtered. He hardly 'ot away with his life, run away, like meself and became a spetton, unlike meself how you can see. And I laughed. I confessed to me sins and was getting ready to meet the Stranger. When the hanging was 'bout to happen the septon talks to the Sir. A godly man, good man doing his duty the knight was. Instead of the rope gets me a ride here. To the bloody Wall. I can't remember how long ago it was over a dozen years I've been freezing my bloody ass of here... I wish I could taste one of them oranges again... for the last time. Hope the septon is doin fine. A good man he was, a godly man, the seven may take care of him. May the maiden send him a blonde with blue eyes and with long legs...I can see it like on one of those damn crows letters. Eat up boy! the feastin won't last long with those damn kingsmen.

Zing.\n\nNope you completely missed my point. I was pointing at the irony of someone calling a person a \"self-hating clown\", when he can obviously learn a thing or two from him. If you know Tyler is better at game than you, then why are you calling him a clown? There's obviously some insecurity there. I don't like Roosh that much, but I can gladly admit he knows a shit ton more about women than I do, and I definitely can learn from him.

Anyone can lie on the internet. \n\n&gt;So what. My sister majored in Russian Literature. That doesn't make her Dostoyevsky.\n\nI pointed this is out because you seem to think Owen strictly follows Tolle. You're straight up wrong. He quotes many philosophers.

People called Socrates, Plato, Spinoza all idiots too. That's not to compare Tolle to the legends, but just to put your opinion in perspective. \n\n&gt;Lots of charlatans are successful. A good fraud is going to be successful. That's a given.\n\nMan you are really trying to convince yourself aren't you. You sound like those people over at PUA-hate. \n\n&gt;No. I literally said the opposite. You don't seem to be able to read.\n\nYou read the book first, then judged Tyler and examined how what all of Strauss said was right. So basically you already had the prenotions of what Tyler would be like and your brain said it was true. Maybe you're too stupid to make up your opinion of the guy.\n\n&gt;People like Ekhart Tolle, Owen, and, well...all self-help gurus are selling a product. They must appeal to customers to be successful. Who are the target customers for self-help? Losers. Losers just like you.\n\nMan you seriously sound like a guy that came straight out of the PUA-hate forum. If you hate seduction then why are you in TRP? Literally everyone in this business is a self-help guru trying to sell you a product, because it's their profession.  I don't buy anything from Owen, Tolle, or others like Mark Manson, Cajun, etc. All of their shit can be easily found online. But that doesn't mean I can't respect them.

{"body": "&gt;  The opposition to healthcare, for instance, is absurd by any logic (why would you oppose free healthcare?)\n\nBecause it's not really free? \"There's no such thing as a free lunch\". I'm afraid if you don't understand opposition to welfare programs you're not even remotely aware of what economics is concerned with. The argument isn't that free healthcare is bad if you view in terms of society, the argument is that it's bad for the market (and progress), it's to some extent political agenda (read populism) and it's supposed to cater to vested interests and is not the most efficient use of resources the way America does it (Australia, Switzerland have absolutely amazing healthcare, NHS isn't bad in Britain). [There's a 500 page (!) long book on it released only this year](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22716469-america-s-bitter-pill) , it's NOT opposition to public healthcare as a concept but ACA in specific. \n\nIf you prefer an article, here's the Economist's take on the book itself. [Obamacare: Good, bad and ugly - Economist] (http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21639432-depressing-story-behind-barack-obamas-biggest-achievement-good-bad-and-ugly)\n\n&gt; libertarian ethic (which I'm actually a fan of).\n\nMuch of American libertarianism is \"legalize weed, muh guns!!\", not much more. Then there are useful idiots who cater to corporate interests to an extent, I say this despite being a proponent of free markets, there's only one Rand Paul, although I confess I'm not a big fan of him. \n\n&gt; Same with gun control. Other countries don't have as much gun violence because they simply don't have guns. And yet, Americans treat their gun rights as nothing less than sacred.\n\nI used to have the same opinion then some informed guy, who himself supports gun control, shed some light on it, its role in their culture and history. Although I think they should impose gun control on automatic weapons at least.\n\n&gt; America has never really owned up to its slave owning past as well.\n\nu wot m8. Maybe it's difference of people we interact with, whenever I discuss history with Americans they always bring up the slavery and apologise for some reason and feel guilt, even though it's none of current gen's fault. I don't see pushing the idea of guilt tbh either. Same goes for Brits and India, while it was their fault back then, pushing them into guilt now isn't doing anyone good.\n\n&gt; You see this particularly outside of big cities in the south. There is still a lot of hand wringing about its past, which is a big cause of racial tensions.\n\nLul, [did you know America is the standout country among developed, rich nations when it comes to religious morality?] (http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2014/05/Revised-Report-Images-2.png) I've only heard horror stories of south, from American themselves, although I can't speak anything on that.

The online backlash worked in our favour, it was the best form of signal boosting. We are working with a tiny budget and to have that kind of exposure is priceless.\n\nGamers:  Christ...then what was all the crying about if the criticism not only didnt crush you but actually helped your sales.\n\n---\n\n&gt;The people who bombed their respective Steam pages, then, didn’t exactly get the outcomes they wanted.

They both agreed that it was less about causing lasting harm and more about saying, “HEY, NOTICE US.”\n\nSo you know what the point was but still going flat out lie and claim you didnt.  Stay classy.\n\n---\n\nOk, Grayson, just retire.  You just arent good at this opinion writing stuff.  You just spent an entire article contradicting yourself and trying, but failing, to create victims.  The people who's projects you are writing about dont even agree with you.  Despite all their whining they admit that the criticism ultimately gave them valuable exposure that they used to help their projects.\n\nyou try to make it seem like the user review process is harmful.  But honestly i just see it as a thinly veiled attempt to solidify your own relevance.  \"Reviews matter, especially professional reviews, so user reviews have to at least kinda matter\" but its clear that written opinion is factoring less and less into purchasing decisions.
