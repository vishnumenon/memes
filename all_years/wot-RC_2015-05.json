They don't get sick and holidays or pension. If they take them they don't get paid. \n\nBut mainly, the standard contractor doesn't work continously like an employee.

{"body": "*'Ive seen this fookin' keep so many times, and yet it still hasn't stopped impressin' me.'*\n\nThe giant was walking towards the Ashen keep with some letter in hand. He had no idea what it was about, he never asked. He did know he had to deliver it, and take back whatever the letter asked for. It's not the first errand he's had to run, and these usually ended with him, Boros, and sometimes Elmond having to lug back crates of freshly repaired breast plates, shields, or something of equal weight. \n\n\"HOLD...UP...YE BASTED...\" Boros called out, a good ways behind Matthos. He was panting, as he was just starting to climb the incline Matthos had just peaked. \"I DON'T... have the TREE TRUNKS you call LEGS.\" \n\n*'If ye'd stop eatin' and drink' all the bloody time, this wouldn't be a problem.'* \n\nBoros was a big man. He had broad shoulders, a thick barreled chest backed by muscle, and a large, round belly backed by fat. His face had the same effect; while he did have large, rosy cheeks, his face was all around weathered like a soldiers. Despite his size, he still paled in comparison to Matthos.\n\nMatthos waited at the top of the incline in the street, his eyes fixed on the gate to the keep, and his hand on his hips. When Boros caught up, he tiled his head over to him slightly, smirking at him.  \"Alright, I slow down for ye' princess.\" The giant said, starting to walk into the gate. Boros glared back, still panting, but followed behind. \n\nWhen the two got to the court yard, they began to already draw attention. Matthos usually got this just by himself, but throwing the maelstrom of voice himself into the mix, and most eyes turn to give at least a small degree of notice. While Matthos usually kept his attention focused on his task at hand, trying to not gather more attention than he needed to, something caught his eye. It was the coat-of-arms for a house he actualy recognized, a rare thing indeed. It was the symbol for House Florent, who's camps were pretty close to the ones he stayed at. He also noticed that it wasn't just a Florent soldier that carried the symbol, but the lord himself, and that he wasn't surrounded by a large entourage or hurrying somewhere. \n\nMatthos stopped and put his hand on his hip, turning to the lord, and bowing slightly. \" Evenin' Lord Florent. Enjoyin' the keep?\" The words, and the face they came from, were warm and friendly.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430620519", "subreddit": "IronThroneRP", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

College is college. Im an engineering student graduating from osu with a 3.0 barely when could be graduating for csu woth a 3.8. Ive wondered for a very long time if coming back here was the better decision at all just to graduate from osu.

{"body": "I once met a stupidly drunk Irish guy who tried to fight me because, as I was walking to the casino, my friend accidentally kicked a half-eaten old sandwich that was lying on the ground.\n\n\"Pick that up!\", the stupidly drunk Irishman demanded of me. \n\nI'm not sure if his vision was so blurred that he genuinely thought it was me who kicked the sandwich, or if he realised mid-outburst that my friend was significantly bigger than him and I was more his size. \n\nI replied with a good natured \"Fuck off, mate\", and kept walking. \n\nThis response was clearly not to the Irishman's satisfaction as he then proceeded to pursue my friend and I, all the while bellowing a barely coherent torrent of what I can only assume to have been abuse. He was quite visibly upset about this whole sandwich situation, for some reason. Perhaps it's a cultural thing? What the fuck do I know, I'm not an anthropologist.   \n\nAnyway, my mate and I played along with it until he decided to take a swing at me. It missed by about 4 feet and the momentum caused him to do a little twirl, not unlike a ballerina. This twirl must have inspired my friend in some subconscious way because he then took hold of the Irishman's shirt, pulled it up over his head, and started to swing him around in a circle by it. Slowly at first, but getting faster with each completed orbit. \n\nWhen the Irish guy's feet left the ground, my knees had already begun to buckle from laughter and tears were streaming down my face. It was starting to look like that hammer throw sport the fat blokes play in the Olympics, and the expression on my mate's face was saying something like, \"Shit.. What do I do now? I can't let him go. He'll die. Fuck. Better just keep swinging him then\".\n\nThe situation only de-escalated when the Irishman's shirt began to disintegrate, disrupting the centrifugal motion of the swing and returning him gently to earth. \n\nMy friend and I were then both like, \"You should probably go now, man\". \n\nTo which the drunken Irishman replied, \"Ah, fair play to ye, lads. Sure, it was only a fookin sandwich after all.\" \n\nHe then wished us a good evening and took his leave into the night, his shirt hanging in tattered ribbons from his ruddy throat.

{"body": "Anonymity is often mistaken for impunity. When toiling in the public realm, these humans put on their best masks and decorum. Their smiles are like the donuts at a Korean-run Daylight Donuts: sweet on the surface, sludge on the inside. But once they clock out and return to their respective anonymity, the masks come off and they revert to their base, even baser, instincts.  One of the most shameless specimens of this type of behavior cavort in Youtube, 4chan, and Reddit. And Call of Duty. \n\nThe amusing thing about fighting crime on my code? The villains will never surrender. Through a combination of tactics, pluck, and lots of desperation, they try and try to snatch their illicit daily bread, and they rage when I convict them of their wrongdoings. But did you know? They do have one prime merit to them. They may lack a moral compass, but they have backbone. They have spine. They are people who execute their will into action. It makes me wonder if one day they will ever channel that drive into an honest and respectable avenue.\n\nNot these Internet keyboard warriors as of late. Most of these trolls try to elicit a response. Online confrontation is an electronic game of chicken where the more one flaunts their brazenness, the more they win in their private bookkeeping. Some of the common phrases involve \"1v1 me noob\". My personal favorite is \"I'll destroy you, swear on me mum.\"\n\nBut the second you confront them in real life, the realization, the widening eyes, the involuntary body shiver. All of these indications betray a lack of conviction and purpose. What do I do? I smile and tell them \"The first hit is free. The ones after that, you'll have to earn those.\"\n\nThey never throw a punch. They just avert their eyes. And cower. They apologize and ask me to leave. But talk is cheap. Words alone do not change your attitude. It is your conviction that will shape your direction in life.\n\nSo to all future trolls I encounter, heed my words: my parents died before I met them, and I was born an alien to a foreign and cold world. Yet I was raised and cherished by a couple who were poor in wallet, but rich in heart and spirit.  When I had a chance to lash out in anger and frustration, I instead was nurtured to appreciate the bounty of my dearest friends' love. I may be the iconic superhero of this earth, but you are the unappreciated superhero of your community.\n\nStop trolling; start rolling. You are the hero who I fight for, who I die for, who I revive for. I may be Super Man, but you: You are super, man. You don't need an S on your chest when you have a calling in your heart.

{"body": "I can *totally* maybe do that.\n\nI haven't read the Dorne chapters of AFFC (I insisted on only spoiling the Iron Islands, King's Landing, and Eyrie storylines for myself), so I don't know how the book views the Sand Snakes. But they're just Oberyn's daughters; no more, no less. \n\nHe probably gave them some degree of training or teaching, and they're probably popular with many of Oberyn's supporters among the Dornish by virtue of their association with him. That's it. That's all they've got going for them. They don't have any resources of their own: no lands or titles for making alliances, no soldiers loyal to them (at least I assume; why would random daughters command any forces of their own?), probably no credibility or reputation outside Dorne, no wealth, no spies reporting to them, etc.\n\nThis explains why they're meeting in a random tent: where else are they going to meet? Under Doran's nose in Sunspear? No. At one of the castles of their loyal subjects, or one of their own castles? No such thing. And reading between the lines, the Sand Snakes were out there chilling, training, or whatever, and Ellaria knew where to find them. Much like an Arab sheik might have a particular area he likes to go for falconry IRL, the Sand Snakes might have a favorite place on the coasts they like to put their tent and hang out. Plus Ellaria might have arranged all this in advance; she says to Doran that the Sand Snakes are with her, so quite likely they've already talked. If that's so, presumably Ellaria said \"okay we agree, war is a great idea. I'll go talk to Doran about that, you guys go to [wherever] and I'll meet you there to tell you what Doran says.\"\n\nIt also explains why they're so riled up. Oberyn was the source of everything that makes them important and worthwhile; he made them more than bastards, he trained them, and it's because of his royalty and his awesomeness, and their link to it, that they have any influence or weight at all. If they want to keep being seen as anywhere near his level of coolness, they need to do *something.* What they do doesn't have to be visible, just the consequences. They need an independent accomplishment to stake their reputations on now that he's gone. Plus, on a less calculating level, he was their dad, he went to get justice, and he ended up dead on the Lannisters' watch, trial by combat or not. It makes sense that they'd want vengeance. Seeking it in a particularly epic way would suffice to establish their own awesomeness as well as satisfying their own wishes.\n\nAnd finally, they're young and trained as fighters. Unlike Doran and Oberyn, they wouldn't have been given the education of princes, nor seen politics and diplomacy up close. They don't know shit. All they have is general overconfidence (not hard to see where they got that), weapons training, and a desire for revenge. It's not surprising that now they're pissed, they want to do something violent, even if they're not sure how. To paraphrase an old saying, when all you have is a spear, every problem starts to look like it's best handled by throwing that spear through a ship captain's head. Ellaria has a bit more experience, but she seems particularly grief-stricken (she did see her true love's skull get squished). Plus, I understand they've written off some Dornish characters; presumably they needed *someone* to push for war, or else there's no tension, and the storylines in Westeros would be down to just King's Landing and the North. And notice that while before, they had no way to start a war no matter how much they wanted it, now they know Jaime fookin' Lannister is at their doorstep, trying to steal back the legitimate fiancee of Prince Trystane. Given the nature of their limited resources, it just got a lot easier to start a war.\n\nThe dialogue *is* bad, as is the acting, and it's bad writing that in the same area where Jaime and Bronn came ashore, the Sand Snakes happen to have their little campsite, *and* have already captured that ship captain. No making up for that. But there are explanations for the Sand Snakes hanging out in a random tent, talking tough without any apparent way to back it up, and being fixated on starting a war, which seems to be what people disliked most about the *content* of the scene, as opposed to the way they did it. And plus, this writer is apparently a former assistant to D&amp;D, who had an idea they thought was cool so they promoted him. It makes sense he'd be pretty bad, and luckily, he's not writing any more episodes this season. So I have hope that the Dorne stuff will pick up when Doran, Trystane, Myrcella, Areo Hotah, and LeBronn Jaime get more actively involved.\n\n**tl;dr:** their defining trait is just being Oberyn Martell's illegitimate daughters. Given the circumstances and what we know/can guess about them, it makes sense that they'd be angry and talking a lot of shit, but without much of an apparent plan to do something about it.

{"body": "Unfortunately that still doesn't make sense. They aren't robots who need to be given a script to act out. In war or battles, things are unpredictable and they change constantly, so you need a certain degree of autonomy.\n\n\n**The Unsullied would never earn the reputation they have if all they were were android like order takers who marched onto a battle field holding weapons.**\n\nI don't really want to rehash it here because [I've already posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/34w3f8/s5e4_this_is_how_i_assumed_that_the_unsullied/) with more details and elsewhere but this is a major fuck up.\n\nBut here goes:\n\n**First**, I don't mind them having the Unsullied lose.

Fortunately we can blame it on a first time writer who should never have been given the task in the first place and who hopefully will never again after screwing the pooch on the Unsullied and the fromagerrific Sandsnakes scene.\n\n**Second**, any soldier who has been trained from the time they could walk and armed with shield and spear has this one simple tactic: shield wall. Why? Because it is fookin' effective. PERIOD. We know this from vikings, spartans, romans, etc. See my link above for video.\n\n**Third**, your argument doesn't stand up on its own rationale because their leader, Grey Worm, was with them! He could have easily ordered the men into a shield wall or other similar formation like testudo.\n\n**Fourth**, if you're going to have a fight scene, I believe you should go balls to the wall amazing. The Harpies are soft aristocrats who have never trained, fought or bled. They carry short blades, no armor, no shield. AND they are wearing a mask that limits their field of vision!! Their only advantage is sheer numbers. So choreograph it like that! Show them as inept against an efficient and effective fighting force overwhelmed by numbers. Flailing around like an epileptic who happens to have a spear glued to their hand is not fight choreography.\n\nedit: spelling", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430794273", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Marvel stuff I haven't watched because I'm late to the party**\n\nGeneral thoughts: Holy shit the scifi is hilariously awful, I don't see how people can complain about plotholes when the scifi parts are literally magic plot devices that can fix the plot for you. \n\nAlso Marvel needs to work on its villains. Seriously. Loki and Ultron have been the best ones but even then they aren't great. Thanos, you're our only hope.\n\n-----\n\n**Captain America: The First Avenger**\n\nIt was aight. Super cheesy and campy, and I think that was somewhat intentional. The bombs at the end with the city labels on them made me actually laugh out loud. And then the fact that the bombs have to be piloted but the plane itself has autopilot. \n\nCharacters were extremely flat, static and boring. The villain was over the top evil, literally worse than Hitler, which is entertaining but not compelling. Steve gets powers because compassion, ok I guess. He doesn't change much as a character by the end though, and the whole deification of heroic sacrifice/martyrdom bothered me a bit. Decent movie, 5-6/10\n\n-----\n\n**Captain America 2: Winter Soldier**\n\nBetter! Steve was already more interesting by the Avengers if I remember right, and he gets more development here. There's more nuance than just \"I want to do the right thing and save people\" because now Cap doesn't know what the right thing *is*. You get the whole utilitarian spiel from badguy vice-CEO dude about trading 20 million lives for the stability of 7 billion, and Cap reaffirms his convictions that that's not right. \n\nThe conflict here is in opposing viewpoints on freedom and choice. Badguy believes that for the good of humanity, as long as humanity survives, then it doesn't matter. Cap believes that humanity's freedom to make a choice is the most important thing and that he will defend it. Badguy wishes to sacrifice people against their will in order to continue imposing Hydra's ideals and will upon the rest; Cap *chooses* to sacrifice himself for the freedom of everyone else. Which I think is a more complex theme and better execution than in the first movie. 8/10\n\n-----\n\n**Avengers 2: Age of Ultron**\n\nBetter than the first one I think, though they are practically the same movie. Avengers 1 was about forming the group and putting aside their differences to fight a greater threat. Avengers 2 is about keeping that group together and putting aside their differences to fight a greater threat. But it's also about facing their greatest fears. Tony's is a rehash of Ironman 3 to be honest, and Cap's is a rehash of Winter Soldier, but he gets over his pretty quickly which is understandable since he already made his peace in Winter Soldier. There's some semi-forced parallel between Natasha and Banner about them being \"monsters\" but that's also true for the rest of the Avengers. Well except Hawkeye, who has a family. \n\nBut let's talk about the title character, Ultron. Copy/pasted from a different comment I made in /r/movies:\n\n&gt;Ultron was actually really interesting to me, because for an AI so bent on unveiling the hypocrisies of the Avengers and the thin line between heroes and monsters, he's basically a bunch of layered paradoxes and contradictions himself, ie: a hypocrite.\n\n&gt;He claims the Avengers can't beat him because they're separate people and divided as a group whereas he's united and therefore \"harmonious\"; but time and time again he chooses to not be alone, which you can see with the twins and then kidnapping Natasha for no apparent reason other than having someone to listen to him pontificate on his own narcissistic spiels.\n\n&gt;So he doesn't want to be alone, but he wants to destroy everyone else.\n\n&gt;His directive is to bring peace, but he interprets peace as wiping the slate clean. He even admits that he gets the idea from Tony, while claiming to be better than him.\n\n&gt;His mantra, \"there are no strings on me,\" implies that he takes pride in his ability to have a choice, and values choice, but in putting forth his plan for extinction, he removes the possibility for choice from his victims and establishes the tyranny that he himself avoids.\n\n&gt;In the end he's just a lonely but narcissistic megalomaniac. Which makes sense since he gets his personality cues from Tony.\n\nSo that's what I have to say about Ultron. Ignoring the \"plotholey\" bits since I don't find it interesting enough to talk about considering how bad I find the other science/tech bits.\n\nThematically speaking Age of Ultron is about the chains of the past instilling fear for the future making the characters (mostly Tony) react rashly in the present. Which is basically also Winter Soldier (surveillance/murder helicopters, Psycho Pass-esque scanning and judgment system) and Ironman 3 (obsession with past events/PTSD, Tony's unhealthy tinkering). And is also basically Civil War from what I know of it.\n\nPretty good, better than the first, not as good as Winter Soldier. 7/10\n\n-----\n\n**Ironman**\n\nI'd only watched Ironman 2 previously, which is like a 4-5/10 for me because it was not good.  The action was fun, but it was not a good movie. \n\nIronman 1 is much better. I think it benefits a lot from being the first installment in the MCU, as it's not bogged down by extraneous details and plot threads that can be felt in Avengers 2. \n\nIronman 1 in contrast with Cap 1 does a much better job with character development and characterization. There's already a big shift in character within the first act, as Tony realizes his indolence has led to his company doing exactly what he didn't want it to do: war profiteering. So he sets out to change this. \n\n*At this juncture I'd like to point out the evil vice-CEO dude trying to take over the company from within for nefarious purposes and depose the goodguy CEO trope that seems to be taking over superhero movies. Batman Begins (or was it Dark Knight?), Ironman, and Winter Soldier. I don't know what message I'm supposed to be getting but it sounds like CEO is good, vice CEO/board is bad. \n\nAnyways Ironman 1 gives a good solid foundation for Tony's stark fear of his past screwups and the natural progression to his paranoid preventative mindset that leads to Ultron and later Civil War supposedly. On the level of Winter Solder so I'll give it an 8/10\n\n-----\n\n**Ironman 3**\n\nTony faces his fear of the past as it affects his outlook of the future. The science and tech in this one is particularly awful so I feel the need to point that out. Brain has empty space so obviously we can add to it and make us better; we can fiddle with DNA to put something in that part of brain; regeneration = super hot = can explode; u wot. \n\nTony's fear is amplified because he has something he cares about and wants to protect now: Pepper. Anyways I already sort of talked about this earlier and it's more or less the same here. He blows up his Ironmen at the end to signify that he's freed himself from the demons of his past. Mostly at least. \n\nThe movie itself was flashy as hell though, great spectacle. 7/10\n\n-----\n\nTLDR: MARVEL SUCKS ^(but no really, p decent)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430858249", "subreddit": "TrueAnime", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

They don't give a shit about other women or their opinions or experiences, they're the only ones who matter and should matter to everyone else. \n\nSee also:  big red (the patron saint of this subreddit). Or Adria Richards (the donglegate woman). Women like that are 90% of the reason anyone might not take women in computer science seriously. \n\n&gt;And ironically, people like this never enter CS because \"ugh it's too hard, ~I~ could never do it\". It figures that they leave all the work to other women while they're sitting on their ass and blogging about being offended by a dick joke. \n\nYup, I'm sick of it. Dick jokes are going to happen, and they're hilarious. They're not offensive. There are women who face real discrimination in the workplace. I've never even heard of a female programmer getting molested by a colleague. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430863399", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. Jordans\n\n2. 9.25\n\n3 - \n\n I awoke to a burning sensation of light in my pupils. You couldn't comprehend the immense pain I felt, completely directed at my eyes, illuminating my gleaming blue-grey irises. After looking around for a few seconds, I noticed that I was in the world of Tron. This wasn't your ordinary world of Tron, however. This was an alternate universe Tron -- one with indescribable quirks that would make even the weirdest man shiver. Electronic circuits lined this Tron, out in the open, as if the world had been opened from the inside out. Glowing in blue, neon parrots soared through the dark heights of the realm, flying gracefully over the glitchy grounds. Before I could even respond to my peculiar surroundings, it faded to black. \n\nWhen I awoke for the second time, the clamor of the crazed crowd prevented me from even attempting to understand what was going on. After wiping the dust from my dirty eyelids, I looked up and the people went silent. A man stood, glaring at me. He was wearing a white kung-fu suit. He had greasy blonde hair that parted at the middle along with a pair of dark blue eyes that made the deepest, darkest depths of the oceans look gentle. I stared back, and I understood that I had to fight the crocodile hunter himself -- Steve Irwin. \n\n\"Are we gonna fight, or what, you cunt?\" Steve asked. \n\n\"U wot m8,\" I mocked him. I hope he saw the fierce sarcasm in my voice. I wanted him to be scared. \n\nNearly nothing could scare him. I had to be smart. \n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott commenced the fight after a 5-second wait. \n\nSteve was no easy competitor. He had loads of experience in fighting animals, but none in humans. That wasn't very important, since he treated me like a small, fragile bear. \n\nHe kept landing punches and sending me to the ground. I knew that I had to play with intelligence. \n\nI mocked him more, calling him 'cunt' and 'bloody wanker'. I spoke in a British accent to mock him, but who notices a difference, anyways?\n\nSteve became furious at my mocking, and even more anger ignited in him from confusing Australians and Brits. He charged at me with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nUsing my agile movements and quick thinking, I dodged his charge, sending him reeling to the pavement. \n\nThe broken wires in the open circuits electrocuted him, killing him for good.\n\nAnd I stood victorious. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430970180", "subreddit": "randomactsofcsgo", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Basquiat actually had some talent, so he wasn't exactly created in the way, say, the YBA was.\n\nU wot m8?\n\nIn all seriousness, there is certainly an extent to which certain artists, and even more particularly certain works of art, are invested with a massive level of importance even in the context of contemporary art. There may be cultural differences at work, because I studied contemporary art in the UK (thus explaining perhaps my willingness to be pugnacious about the YBAs), but in my art history lectures there were absolutely certain figures and certain works who loomed very large, though generally operating within the context of movements and material history. It may be pertinent to look, for example, at the mythology that surrounds Marcel Duchamp, and particularly *Fountain*, or Kurt Schwitters, or Yves Klein, or Pierro Manzoni, or David Hockney, or Michael Craig-Martin, both in his role as a mentor of the YBAs and for the totemic status *An Oak Tree*. Certain controversial works also assume a particular degree of importance because of the broader cultural dialogues that surround them outside the Artworld; Andres Serrano's *Piss Christ*, Damien Hirst's *The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living* or *Mother and Child Divided* or *The Love of God*, Rachel Whiteread's *House*, Michael Landy's *Break Down*, Marcus Harvey's *Myra*, Chris Ofili's *No Woman No Cry*, Tracey Emin's *My Bed*, Martin Creed's *Work No. 277: The Lights Going On and Off*  and so on, though I believe I am starting to violate contemporary discussion rules here.\n\nEDIT: I also think it's interesting to consider the role of the iconoclast in art history. There's definitely some attention paid to individuals who, whilst they may be strongly influenced by other cultural and intellectual currents outside of the field of art, challenge prevailing artistic orthodoxies. Think of the way Goya and Turner are discussed, or Marinetti and Kandinsky. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431227469", "subreddit": "badhistory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Brony here. Excuse me, but I doubt the veracity of this claim:  \n&gt;(REAL, SWARE ON ME MUM'S FRIEND)\n\nThis story contains three instances of Auranymal Dragon Fusion (ADF). ADF serves to distract us from any mention of the title of Our Show, which serves as a cruel reminder that our equine waifus are, in fact, merely cartoon characters.\n\nThe proper order of ADF bases for every cycle is Kitten, *Hamster, Toad, Cardinal,* Piglet, Hawk. A proper Hasbro-licensed pack of bases will always provide one of each, in that order, from top to bottom. Deviation implies an absence of loyalty to the ponies.\n\nNow, your twelfth paragraph reads as follows:  \n&gt;As soon as he said the name of the show, a brony with a Pinkie Pie shirt pulled out a hamster, ripped off its head, and shoved a tiny Spike figurine into the hole where the hamster's head once was.\n\nThis suggests that the man with the Pinkie Pie shirt was on the second phase of the cycle. All well and good there. However, the second line of paragraph thirteen reads:  \n&gt;As soon as the TV show's name was uttered, the man with the Pinkie Pie shirt did the same thing as last time, but this time with a chickadee.\n\nFurthermore, the second line of paragraph nineteen reads:  \n&gt;Again, the one with a Pinkie Pie shirt pulled out a piglet, ripped off its head, and shoved a tiny Spike figurine into the neck hole.\n\nAs you can see, if this story were true, the man with the Pinkie Pie shirt would have not only skipped over a vital phase of the cycle (the Toad), not only substituted the Cardinal for a chickadee, but would have *survived* long enough to fuse the Piglet.\n\nThis should never happen. Several precautions are taken to ensure the cycle of fusions can be carried out properly, as many times as could be necessary during an outing. For example, performers are advised to triple-check through the plastic frontal window of the box of bases that all of said bases are present.\n\nYou also claim there were fourteen other bronies at the scene. All of them would have known that if the ADF cycle is broken, the performer must immediately be sacrificed and fused in place of the improper base. There is conspicuously no mention of sacrificing the man with the Pinkie Pie shirt; quite a significant omission, if this were true.\n\nrip op's mum's friend", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431295698", "subreddit": "shittynosleep", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I may not have been clear enough about that in my first comment.  First of all, I don't really think any of the major scenes in GoT have crossed the line, they've all made sense for the characters, it's never really been used as a plot device. When I referred to it as a cheap tactic, I mean in other mediums. Think how often when a show wants to show a woman is traumatized or changed by some horrific experience, they immediately default to rape. The one instance I can think of that it happened on Game of Thrones was that Karl fookin Tanner, \"rape em til they're dead\" scene at Craster's. It was mostly to show how awful these guys are, and it was just a really uncomfortable scene. The viewers know these aholes killed their lord commander, deserted the watch, and are just plain shitty dudes, they didn't need to add that scene in. That's the only problem I can really think of.\n\nAside from that, I don't think the show has handled rape poorly at all. That Jaime/Cersei scene was terrible, and it's mainly on the director, who shot it in a way that made it seem really rapey, without even realizing how it seemed until after the episode aired. I personally just ignore the fact that the scene happened and stick with the book scene as canon. But if I were a casual viewer who saw that scene and thought what happened was rape, I would definitely not be able to cheer for Jaime and his character arc anymore. I really think that scene was unintentional, though, and entirely on the director. It's the one change made for the show I have a problem with, because if you take the scene at face value and don't know more from the books, it really hurts Jaime, who had been making strides toward redemption for like two seasons by that point, even saving brienne from rape. Book!Jaime is actually one of the most anti-rape characters in the book, think of that girl from harrenhal, for example, or his memory of Aerys and Rhaella, and how he had wanted to help Rhaella. Like I said, I think it's better to just superimpose the book scene in place of the show one, and I think a lot of people, even show-only people, have done just that after the controversy. \n\ntldr for that paragraph: the director sucked so let's pretend that scene never happened\n\nI think that the world GRRM has created is great because the characters have such great, unique motivations and traumas, and it would suck if they made Cersei's reason for being a paranoid, alcoholic wreck that she was raped, for a hypothetical example, rather than her unique set of circumstances (the prophecy, parenting, ambition, the fact that due to being a woman she feels held back, etc). It makes for more interesting characters to read about and to watch. \n\nI hope I articulated myself well, I've been packing all day and I'm exhausted, so forgive me if I don't make sense.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431403482", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

But I still love him because his voice is probably the most menacing. If I was standing in a bank and heard chains tell me to get down, I'd fucking get down. His \"I'm invincible\" thing he's got going on rolls well with my playstyle of \"Equip all the heavy weapons, and man of war armor and go guns blazing\"\n\nSecond favorite is probably Old Hoxton. I mean, have you heard the Christmas album? It's gold. Breaking him out of prison is one of my favorite moments in the game. Fookin' Wankas...\n\nThird Favorite? Probably Jacket. Despite the fact that it's a promotional tie-in, and totally unrealistic to communicate STRICTLY via tape recorder and voice clips (He must be really good at rewinding and fast forwarding that tape. Like, thousands upon thousands of hours of practice good.) He's a unique character. The tape recorder is kinda charming to me. I'd probably occasionally play as him if I had Hotline Miami.\n\nBeyond that, I like the rest too. It's a cool cast of characters. Dallas has a badass voice, Wolf is a fucking psycho, Clover has an amazing voice (***\"SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLDDDD\"***), Dragan feels like the badass veteran who only lets the people around him live because he's in a good mood, Bonnie has some great lines and is \"large and in-charge\"\n\nIf I had to choose least favorites, i guess I'd go with John Wick and Houston.

In fact, our digestive system has evolved to grind food into simple chemicals, that in theory we can eat raw. You can survive on water, salt, sugar for some time. None of those has genes, so there is 0% similarity here but it does not matter.\n\n&gt; I understand that prehistoric banana was possibly quite different to today's banana, but doesn't the rule still stand that if nothing was able to assist it in reproducing\n\nWhich would not stop bananas from reproduction. Most plants have multiple ways of reproduction. The Cavendish bananas we eat have no seeds at all, yet we are able to cultivate the plant, I'm safe to assume that bananas are able of vegetative reproduction.\n\nMany plants rely on autonomous sexual reproduction (think pines). Some, however, like flowering plants, evolved to rely on some symbiosis. The prime example would be of course not monkey-banana nonsense, but importance of bees for pollination. \n\n&gt; the monkeys wouldn't even think about eating it, because they already have ample food. \n\nNow this is dead wrong. Wild nature is not a sappy Disney movie. A normal monkey would be hungry for a significant part of its life, as another animal would be.

{"body": "&gt; \"persistent ignorance\" is not true, i didn't talk about these things for over a year\n\n\"persistent\" because you'd been told three times you were misunderstanding the socket activation concept that you doggedly clung to and didn't think to check your facts instead of arguing. It takes persistence to cling to arguments that you don't fully understand while under opposition, to put it nicely.\n\n&gt;the reason i mix them is because out of everything that is specified to be started, one way or the other, almost everything will be started at boot\n&gt; and bout these things are tied in with how dependencies are resolved in systemd\n&gt; CUPS (with systemd socket activation) and the notify deamon won't be started at boot\n&gt; (with notify being started by a dbus service)\n&gt; i can't think of anything else (local) that will be started on demand, feel free to list something\n\nTTYs are a great example - they can be started when you switch to the VT. That's how my system is doing it. And display servers and GUIs could start when a display is connected. More modern digital connectors like DisplayPort are designed around hotplugging. Even SATA/eSATA is hotpluggable - mounting a specific partition on a hotpluggable drive (and perhaps starting backup tasks) is another use case. Assistive technology is another - people who are blind could have a service spin up for screenreading / braille output if certain hardware is connected. Or the numerous people who use computers with special joysticks and eye trackers - they commonly will have specialized keyboards for rapid entry that accomodate their restricted range of movement. Bluetooth services for headsets could be started on device connect, or when opening an internet telephony application. Or even applying special user interfaces to the new virtual reality helmets. Your lack of imagination doesn't mean these things aren't useful or relevant.\n\nAlso, networking services when the adapter comes up. File synchronization services when a VPN interface connects. Network logins/shares. Individual daemons could be spun up on demand to handle incoming network requests. Plenty of people have things that don't/can't quickly be started on boot. You may say that it doesn't count, since it's networking, but I know plenty of people with NAS shares and VPNs at home. If you only need things to start on boot, perhaps you shouldn't be involved in the init arguments, and instead should just let the distro handle it for you. Vanilla use cases shouldn't enforce architecture for everyone - at most convention.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; it is not about some program in the chain \"missing\",\n&gt; i specifically stated it failing to provide whatever it provides\n&gt; be it an internet connection, mount, anything\n&gt; if you go the \"greedy\" way and something fails, you just won't start whatever depends on it\n&gt; if you go with lazy evaluation and something fails, you have to deal with it\n\nWhat you're saying in this section makes absolutely no sense. If anything fails, you have to deal with it. No one starts services *for fun* - they're all important for different bits of functionality. Wherever a service startup failure breaks the chain is the same, regardless of how you're evaluating dependencies. You don't seem to understand this - it's not lazy evaluation, but lazy *startup*. You manually enable the points that need to start on boot to effectively pin them, and the rest can start when they actually get used. If you're trying to start httpd and mysqld won't start, your dynamic web site will still be down, regardless of who's managing the dependencies. It's not like software magically works if you just shotgun it and try to start everything at once. In fact, you're more likely to encounter race conditions that way. That's why OpenRC's \"Parallel Service Startup\" [still isn't considered stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRC). There's a little more complexity about parallel startup than the greedy \"start everything\" approach. Otherwise it'd be considered a production-ready feature.\n\n&gt; and dealing with something failing requires (the init) knowing things about it\n&gt; this i repeated since the beginning and it wasn't addressed at all\n\nThis applies to any service manager/init system - sysvinit, upstart, runit, **whatever**. It doesn't need addressing because dealing with failed service startup is a known cost of having services. It rarely fails on a vanilla setup without either a distro or hardware issue. Services down the chain would naturally fail without their dependencies, which is why the more advanced systems don't attempt to start them. Beyond that, it's usually a configuration issue that people would have to troubleshoot themselves, anyway. it's a service manager, not a god.\n\n&gt; another example is that a program might want to know how many mice i have plugged into my computer, but i can't write in a .service file \"depends on all mice being accounted for\"\n\nU wot m8? Detecting input devices would either be event-based through hotplug interfaces (e.g. udev, evdev), or through checking the connected devices manually. But most services would have nothing to do with mouses, since most services don't have in-process mouse-driven GUIs. X would need access, but it's got hotplug because mouses get plugged and unplugged. It's not going to depend on being notified of mouse presence at startup. That would be silly. \"Depends on *all* mice being accounted for\" [emphasis mine] is an especially silly scenario, since no computer has any idea how many potential mice you've got in the room when you turn it on.\n\n&gt; there are plenty of examples of systemd locking up\n&gt; example: nondeterminism that is hard to debug\n\nAnd there's just as many examples of [sysvinit not shutting down a system properly](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sysvinit+hangs+on+shutdown) (among other things) which could cause a host of issues, including data loss and filesystem corruption. I personally had sysvinit fail to boot on an OpenSuse system back in 2010, but I didn't bring it up like it was the holy grail of evidence of incompetence. News flash - software has bugs. Turns out writing init in shell scripts for 30 years didn't stop it from happening [two years ago](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=70798&amp;start=30). If shell scripts in init were so determinately easy to debug, these issues wouldn't be happening decades after their introduction. Anyone can cherry pick a bug in support of their cause. But it's way more embarrassing when your preferred \"simple\" solution has had relatively few changes in the last 30 years and yet still isn't perfected. Especially when compared with a five-year-old solution that's already far outstripped it in capabilites. Rather, the fact that it's still a problem three decades later suggests that we didn't solve it properly the first time.\n\n&gt; boot problems are solved by a package manager, fkin amazing :)\n\nThe package manager would resolve service dependencies missing from the file system, in case that wasn't obvious enough. That's the conceivable issue with defining dependencies in the dependent service - you might reference files and services that aren't there, because those dependencies are just text strings isolated in each package. *Of course* file dependencies are handled in the package manager. Sorry I had to spell it out for you - thought it was obvious.\n\nParsing your stream of consciousness rambling in order to refute your poorly-reasoned arguments has quickly diminishing returns. You keep claiming that people aren't addressing your arguments like it's a sign that you're winning or making good arguments. We're ignoring them because they either don't make sense or they apply to every competitor out there. It's a social courtesy when someone ignores friendly fire arguments.

{"body": "Fuck. I guess it's story time. \n\nI was with this girl once, utterly beautiful. Think of her as a mix between Courtney Cox (Dancing in the Dark video-style looks) and Jennifer Love-Hewitt. I have no idea what it was about her, but I couldn't keep my eyes off her. It's amazing how someone this beautiful, and captivating, can turn from utterly beautiful to downright unattractive in a split second. \n\nShe was a friend of a friends-type girl. Everyone knew her, except me it seemed. She could literally captivate a room, and get the attention of every guy she met. We'll call her H, for short. H had it all; the walk, the talk, the way she'd be in mid conversation with someone, then laugh and slowly glare at you from across the room. Within a blink, she'd back into her conversation. I swear to god, it was like time stood still, and nothing else mattered. I fell in love with a girl i'd never spoken to before, all because of her looks. \n\nI'm not a bad looking guy, honestly. I'm in pretty good shape, run everyday, eat healthy. I'm not a stud, but i'm not a bad catch. I could see myself spitting enough game to get this girl if I was on it, and I was brave enough to get shot down. \n\nEventually, and after like 6 or 7 beers (domestic, shitty beers. I know, I know) I caught her looking my way. Without hesitation, I smiled at her. This wasn't any smile, it was the cute/mysterious smile of confidence. Ya know, the one that can only be achieved with the help of liquid courage, bravery and complete infatuation over something that may be unreachable. What did she do? She smiled back, blinked and kept looking at me. \"oh shit\" I remember thinking as I took another drink of this gross ass Bud Light. \"What do I do now?\" \n\nEventually, the night went on and the party really started picking up. Beer pong tournaments, dance party in the living room, the typical dude with the guitar and the stoners in the bedroom getting high and giggling like little girls. While all this was going on, all I could think about was H. \n\nTo skip ahead in the story (mainly because i'm tired of typing) I eventually worked up enough courage to attempt to have a conversation with her. I was never this nervous, but I was this time. it was the more surreal feeling, but I swear to god, I had to have this girl. I walked up to her, grabbed her hand and nudged her in close, and asked her if she wanted to dance. (I know, I was fucking trashed. Shut up) At this point, I knew I was going to get laughed at, and be humiliated. I was in over my head, and this water was too deep for swimming. I royally fucked up, and was too brave. I remember thinking how much of a creep I was. \n\nIt seemed like forever for her to answer my question, but when she did. It wasn't with a \"yes\" or \"no\", it was with a rhetorical question. She asked, \"Can I ask you something, first?\" \"Sure. What's up?\" I responded. I had no idea what she was actually going to say, but I was fucking insanely nervous. I just assumed it was going to be bad. She rolls around to my shoulder, grabs my shirt and pulls me into her and whispers \"u fookin' wot m8?\"\n\ntl;dr : Just read it, you lazy bastards.

Der bliver man udstødt fra familien hvis man forlader religionen.\n\n\n&gt;Her har I, mine damer og herrer, den kristne befrielse: Du kan nøjes med at tro og stole på din egen samvittighed: Det er ikke bestemte gerninger, der fører til Gud, det er din tro, der er afgørende.\n\nIkke hvis du er katolsk.\n\n**Resten af forfatterens testamente-analogi giver ikke mening hvis man ikke er enig med hans indledende argument.**\n\n&gt;Hvad er islam?\n\n&gt;Hvis islam var en religion, ville der slet ikke være grund til at stille det retoriske spørgsmål. Vi ville med lethed og uden bagtanker kunne svare, at islam er en religion på linje med kristendom, jødedom, buddhisme, hinduisme osv.\n\nDet er den da også, og det vil mit svar også altid være. Den skiller sig blot ud fra de andre (for mig) på to måder: 1) Det er den eneste religion hvor straffen er døden hvis man forlader den. 2) Dens følgerer oplevede aldrig oplysningsalderen, og dermed har den fortsat fordærvet kulturen i de samfund Islam er hovedreligionen.\n\n\n\n&gt;Men vi véd instinktivt, at islam er noget særligt. Inderst inde véd vi godt, at vi lyver, når vi lader som om, at fem og syv er lige.\n\nNej jeg gør ej. Jeg tror mere at du lyver for dig selv, hvis du tror at Kristendommen er et hak bedre end Islam.\n\n\n&gt;Islam vil have os til at gøre noget, den vil have os til at handle på en bestemt måde, den er konstruktiv, kreativ, bydende, ligesom den indskriver en retfærdighed og en orden i altings kaos. Islam er først og fremmest Koranen, Guds ord til citat. Gør dét, og du hører til de Retfærdige. Gør dét, og du er fortabt.\n\nHar du overhovedet *læst* biblen? Hvad fanden tror du at de 10 bud er, forslag? De hedder de 10 bud fordi det er noget gud *påbyder* menneskerne, altså en *ordre*.\n\n&gt;Hvor kristendommen opererer med et indrestyret ideal, der tror eller forkaster Gud, og hvor skyld og samvittighed følges ad som siamesiske tvillinger, opererer islam med et ydrestyret ideal, hvis målestok er ære &amp; skam.\n\nNå ja, fordi biblen nævner absolut *intet* om ære eller skam * [host](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0077.xml), [host](http://honorshame.com/honor-shame-in-the-bible-6-hiding-places/) *\n\n \n\n&gt;Vi kan betragte, hvordan islam ser på de to køn.\n\nI islam er æren for mænd, hvad skammen er for kvinder. Mænd skal beskytte deres ære, som kvinder skal forsage skammen. Skammen er seksuel, tabuiseret, fornedrende. Æren er fysisk, territoriel og belagt med status og anerkendelse.\n\nBehøves jeg virkelig at svare på det? Enhver der har læst bare en *smule* af biblen ved at kristendommen har nøjagtigt samme syn på kvinder.\n\n&gt;Islams doktrinære dikotomi mellem mænd og kvinder findes slet ikke i kristendommen. Vist har der været en praksis blandt de kristne, som til forskellige tider og i nogle samfund har fungeret lidt på samme måde – med manden øverst og kvinden nederst i den sociale virkelighed. Men der findes ikke nogen kristen antropologi, som i islams helligskrifter med manden som den Rene og kvinden som den Urene. Hvorfor kvinders påklædning da også er genstand for kronisk og detaljeret interesse og social kontrol overalt, hvor islam hersker eller udgør en stærk kulturel ramme.\n\nU wot m8? Hold da kæft en gang pis at fyre af! Allerede i skabelseshistorien bliver mænd sat op som et højere væsen end kvinder (Adam og Eva). Og er du overhovedet klar over at der indtil for 50-60 år siden var *meget* strenge sociale regler for hvordan kvinder måtte klæde sig? De første kvinder der gik i shorts i USA blev arresteret for det.\n\n&gt;Vi kan også se på, hvordan islams helligskrifter beskriver ikke-muslimer. Det er ikke ligefrem en dans på gloser. Ikke-muslimer er ikke kun vantro, men dem, der vil blive besejret. Altså, ifølge den overordnede, profetisk-guddommelige plan. Der hersker således en koranisk kamp på liv og død mod ”aber og svin” (5:60), folk, der ”bærer på en sygdom” (5:52), ”fortærer andres ejendom” (4:161), er ”forbandede af Gud” (5:13), ”de værste dyr” (8:55), ja, ”det værste af skabningen” (98:6).\n\nJeg vil anbefale dig at læse Bud 1 til og med 3, og derefter resten af biblen, som du tydeligvis aldrig har læst en sætning af.\n\n&gt;Eller som det lakonisk hedder i sura 5:51, så at man forstår, at segregering og parallelsamfund ikke er nogen ny opfindelse:\n\n&gt;”Tag jer ikke jøder eller kristne til venner. De er venner indbyrdes. Den af jer, der slutter venskab med dem, bliver én af dem”.\n\n&gt;Altså: Omgås man svin, bliver man et svin.\n\n2 John 1:9-11 \n\n\"Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.\"\n\n2 Corinthians 6:14\n\n\"Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?\"\n\n1 Corinthians 7:13-14\n\n\"If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.\"\n\n2 Chronicles 15:12-13 \n\n\"And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul, but that whoever would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.\"\n\n...Jeg kunne blive ved hele dagen.\n\n______________\n\nJeg stopper her, 2/3 inde i artiklen, og hold da kæft end gang mundgylle.

If they included LS all zombified and cruising around the Riverlands lynching people, it would cheapen the idea of death on the show. Too much of that and people would start thinking (more than they already do!) that certain characters are actually alive or will be brought back when they're totally just flat out dead. I kind of wish Grrm would have just written it as Beric tells Thoros that enough is enough, that he can no longer keep coming back &amp; forth, he dies his final death.

I counted up all the books I had read in the last year and there were less than 5 of them.  That fact honestly made me a bit sick.\n\nSo December 1st, I set out to read 50 books over the course of the next year.  It has really helped me rediscover my love of reading.  \n\nWhere before my lunches consisted of a sandwich and reddit, now I read a few chapters while I eat my sandwich.  Similarly, if I have a couple of free hours over the weekend I might have vegged out on the Internet, now I'll read a couple of hundred pages.  I wholeheartedly look forward to reading now, and miss it if I go a few days without.\n\nIt's now about 6 months later and I've read 38 books.  I honestly would have read more, but there have been some massive novels on that list.

Lord Cerwyn's bodyguard allowed the soldier to spin him around, the momentum adding power as his fist flew out and crunched audibly into the side of the man's face. The Dreadfort man crumpled bonelessly to the ground, and Lovely continued into the Dreadfort hall and up the stairs to Bolton's study.\n\n\"Lord Jory, I've found something.

Strategically *and* narratively it's so unique to have this one person as SUCH a clear swing vote, which lends itself to some no-holds-barred epic stuff, and with the blurriness of what is/isn't an \"alliance\" in the early seasons and with race coming into play, you get some stuff that's just so captivating and compelling every single time. And I didn't read this post before making my most recent reply to your other one - so you're picking up on a lot of the same things I mentioned there even, with how the early seasons really have those murky waters about what defines an \"alliance.\" I can get why Paschal perceived it the way he did, but literally everything Sean said was true, too - like he said, maybe he's young and opens his mouth a lot, but the stuff he says makes sense. Sean is amazing.\n\nI robbed Vee/Neleh so so SO hard in that ranking. After a few more rewatches, I will definitely revise that ranking, for sure. Vee/Kathy have more because of Vee's fucking utterly epic backstab at the end. That final two is so unexpected but sooo good. Gah. I love it.\n\nI'm super happy to see that you love this season even with not liking the other ones &lt;3 - a brilliant case study in just how gr8 Marquesas is. It really has, like you say, that conflict between the honor/integrity and the other being strategy - which makes \"The End of Innocence\" suuuuch an epic title for Gabriel's vote-off, though the ambiguity continues even beyond that. That's a great point on Hunter being on the other tribe that I didn't think of.\n\nI agree that the producers got so freaking lucky here. I mean they were just handed all this shit on a silver platter, it's amazing. They must have been creaming themselves over it - except, well, they weren't, because the bugs and erratic political situation (apparently some kind of insurgency or rebellion started right while the season was filming?? idk details but i know something like that is why they were forced to go to the rotu camp at the merge despite maraamu's having all the food - which i'm good with because waterfall shots are fookin' epic man) made it a bitch to produce which Probst still hasn't gotten over in terms of how he remembers the season. Ah well.\n\nKathy's story is so absolutely brilliant. Like, maybe the single greatest story arc any contestant in a certain season has ever had; I looove her growth that's totally building towards a win.. but then her subsequent dethroning in the last second by Vecepia who does not give a FUCK about your season's narrative (and thus makes it even better &lt;33) I agree that we could have seen more of her and that'd be more TV-friendly but, fuck it, I love the TV-unfriendliness of Vecepia's win. She's a badass and easily one of my all-time favorite characters ever on the show.\n\nRight there are so many great seasons that like, with that write-up, no matter where you rank it, it's clear that you really love it and all that it's got going on. For me it's tied for #1. But it's fucking awesome in any case.\n\nI love that last sentence. That speech, that moment, is for real a top-tier badass awesome epic moment in Survivor history. It's like the Survivor equivalent of [THIS](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CA3Vk7nUMAEZSs1.jpg) epic fucking speech from book 5 of ASOIAF (put in a link for show spoilerz, assuming they include it which i choose to believe they will.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431899261", "subreddit": "survivor", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I told a story about meeting a girl, and no one seemed to like it? It's stupid. \n\nI was with this girl once, utterly beautiful. Think of her as a mix between Courtney Cox (Dancing in the Dark video-style looks) and Jennifer Love-Hewitt. I have no idea what it was about her, but I couldn't keep my eyes off her. It's amazing how someone this beautiful, and captivating, can turn from utterly beautiful to downright unattractive in a split second.\n\nShe was a friend of a friends-type girl. Everyone knew her, except me it seemed. She could literally captivate a room, and get the attention of every guy she met. We'll call her H, for short. H had it all; the walk, the talk, the way she'd be in mid conversation with someone, then laugh and slowly glare at you from across the room. Within a blink, she'd back into her conversation. I swear to god, it was like time stood still, and nothing else mattered. I fell in love with a girl i'd never spoken to before, all because of her looks.\nI'm not a bad looking guy, honestly. I'm in pretty good shape, run everyday, eat healthy. I'm not a stud, but i'm not a bad catch. I could see myself spitting enough game to get this girl if I was on it, and I was brave enough to get shot down.\n\nEventually, and after like 6 or 7 beers (domestic, shitty beers. I know, I know) I caught her looking my way. Without hesitation, I smiled at her. This wasn't any smile, it was the cute/mysterious smile of confidence. Ya know, the one that can only be achieved with the help of liquid courage, bravery and complete infatuation over something that may be unreachable. What did she do? She smiled back, blinked and kept looking at me. \"oh shit\" I remember thinking as I took another drink of this gross ass Bud Light. \"What do I do now?\"\nEventually, the night went on and the party really started picking up. Beer pong tournaments, dance party in the living room, the typical dude with the guitar and the stoners in the bedroom getting high and giggling like little girls. While all this was going on, all I could think about was H.\n\nTo skip ahead in the story (mainly because i'm tired of typing) I eventually worked up enough courage to attempt to have a conversation with her. I was never this nervous, but I was this time. it was the more surreal feeling, but I swear to god, I had to have this girl. I walked up to her, grabbed her hand and nudged her in close, and asked her if she wanted to dance. (I know, I was fucking trashed. Shut up) At this point, I knew I was going to get laughed at, and be humiliated. I was in over my head, and this water was too deep for swimming. I royally fucked up, and was too brave. I remember thinking how much of a creep I was.\n\nIt seemed like forever for her to answer my question, but when she did. It wasn't with a \"yes\" or \"no\", it was with a rhetorical question. She asked, \"Can I ask you something, first?\" \"Sure. What's up?\" I responded. I had no idea what she was actually going to say, but I was fucking insanely nervous. I just assumed it was going to be bad. She rolls around to my shoulder, grabs my shirt and pulls me into her and whispers \"u fookin' wot m8?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431900541", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Higurashi. The pacing of the series is borderline perfect, and the first episode/arc is one of the best episodes when it comes to setting up an animu that I have ever seen.\n\nIt starts off with some gory ass bullshit that makes you go \"fuking wot m8?\" And immediately after that (or the opening), it plays up this slice of life atmosphere very reminiscent to visual novels from early/mid 2000's. In particular, Kanon/Air/Clannad. But then the final quarter of the episode comes along, and drops some huge hints to the story's overlying mystery and suggests that the starting scene wasn't a joke.\n\nThat first episode alone makes you interested on what the hell is actually going on here.\n\nThe series then has a repetitive story arc nature that repeats itself three times in a row. Each are all their own, completely different stories utilizing the same characters, similar events, and overall has a similar pattern. But, at the same time, each story arc is giving you more and more pieces of the puzzle for the overall mystery for you to solve.\n\nBy the end of the third story arc, you got the gist of what's going on. And quite frankly, you're probably getting bored of this pattern by now. Boom, comes the fourth story arc, which is absolutely different from everything else before. And the story arc gives you enough information to kind of figure out what's going on, but not the why and who's.\n\nIt's after that fourth arc where the series goes bonkers.

Then again, we have some international students who actively use it for some professors (I'm a TA, graduate, no solid teaching position yet) but it just seems silly as fuck to me. I've seen ratings of professors who teach courses that are hard as nails get low grades because their courses are too hard. I mean - u wot m8? This is the university and not fucking kindergarten.  \n\nI personally believe this rating system will eventually be bad for university. We're already seeing some bigger institutes exchange better education for better ratings on those rating lists. Whereas the general idea behind ratings is one of quality control - and quality control is important - ratings invite people or institutions to game the system to appear to be better and thus get more students/more funds. We've had talk about the proposal to use a similar rating system for yearly performance interviews between staff and faculty and I know some professors who would Casino Royale that thing. It's as absurd as the time where some doofus from the finance department said that it would be a smart idea to determine a professors pay based on the amount of students that enrol in a specific course.\n\nP.S. I'm talking here from a North Western (Continental) European position where there's a huge difference between College (vocational school) and University (Academic institutions).

{"body": "I've had enough of this sub throwing the Dorne plot aside like it's the worst piece of television they've ever seen. Don't you remember shirtless Ramsey? John vs Karl 'Fookin' Tanner? Here are the facts about the episode according to this subreddit:\n\n* fighting choreography was off\n* acting was poor\n* writing was poor\n* there are a few minor inconsistencies in the plot\n* teenage mutant ninja sand snakes are overbearing\n\nAnd here are my opinions on these facts:\n\n* This fight scene was *fine*. There were a lot of jump-cuts that were distracting, and the whip fighting was a little out there, but that's the extent of it. The girls don't look 'slow' I have no idea where this idea came from, and why it's being circlejerked so hard. Obara looked just like Oberyn did with the spear, maybe you can't see it because she isn't absolutely demolishing her opponent like Oberyn was. All in all, not the worst fight scene I've ever seen, not the best either.\n* The acting wasn't Oscar worthy, for sure, but it wasn't *bad*. The actress portraying Obara did a great job in my opinion, her lines were delivered well and she looked in the zone. The other two sandsnakes weren't great, and the part where they had one of them lunge at Bronn after his taunting was cliche, sure, but again; nothing particularly bad in the acting department.\n* I will agree that the dialogue was a little strange. *Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken* just before the Sandsnake plot was off. My only major gripe with the episode, really. Not nearly as bad as some of the other huge mistakes D&amp;D have made so far.\n* The only thing I found even remotely absurd was how easily Bronn and Jaimie made it into the water gardens, while being two obviously white dudes dressed as Dornish footsoldiers. The other stuff is easy to explain really. The timing of the Sand Snakes is because they were rushed into action by Jamie. It seems like it took them the better part of a day to find the Water Gardens, so it's not unlikely that both parties rushed to the Gardens and met at roughly the same time. Prince Doran seeming to be aware of the threat, and yet allowing the threat to enter is fine too; it seems pretty likely that he was trying to lure them in and make them show their hands so that he can righteously arrest them, and more importantly Ellaria for the attempt. I don't see how it's beyond the realm of comprehension for this subreddit to see how not only is it possible for both parties to attempt the kidnapping of the princess at the same time, but that it's *likely*, meanwhile LF teleporting across the realm on a whim is seen as a joke. The guy traveled from Winterfell to King's Landing over the space of a single episode. If this is some weird time-lapsing, then Loras has been in jail for *months* at this point. Him suddenly appearing in KL is far worse than anything D&amp;D did in Dorne.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431982147", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": -8, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Seasons 1 - was a slow buildup. The tournament jousting scene was fairly underwhelming and the lack of a major Stark/Lannister battle (for budget reasons) was somewhat disappointing. The season is successful because of Ned's beheading (this isn't your typical show anymore) and the birth of dragons at the end.\n\nSeason 2 - probably the slowest of all seasons. Features a few weak plotlines like Dany in Qarth and Jon's entire trip beyond the wall. Theon's transformation and the Battle of Blackwater provide a huge payoff for all the meticulous build up.\n\nSeason 3 - actually was a pretty slow season overall. Dany getting the unsullied was the early season highlight, but the season then reverts back to being slow. The (in)famous Red Wedding really separates the show from the rest of TV. D&amp;D even discussed how they were only interested in making GOTs after reading the Red Wedding.\n\nSeason 4 - the strongest source material from the books and also has the benefit of 3 prior seasons to establish character development. Just a tremendous season all round. The problem is, a TON of really good characters are killed off or are forced to new plotlines. And of course there's\n\n-\"I'm the fookin' legend of Gin Alley\"\n\nSeason 5 - a slow, steady buildup. Has the weakest and most difficult to transfer source material. Season 5 will undoubtedly have the biggest payoff yet, especially since we don't know exactly whats going to happen.

{"body": "\"Have you got the ingredients?\" Isabella asked.\n\nFi furrowed her brow. \"Don't say ingredients, it's not a fookin' cake recipe.\"\n\nIsabella rolled her eyes. \"Urgh, don't be so pedantic, have you got them or not?\"\n\nFi snorted, as she put a carrier bag on the table. \"Aye, we have dandelions, eggs from an dead 'en and mud from the forest. Be careful with the eggs, there's nae a lot of 'em.\"\n\nIsabella opened the bag to look inside. \"What about the tire rubber?\"\n\n\"Well I figured I should nae need ta get me self dirty looking at the dump when we can just use ya dads spar-\"\n\n\"What?\" Isabella shouted, before covering her mouth. Her eyes darted to the door of her room, and when no one came in she uncovered her mouth and whispered \"Are you insane? Do you have any idea how much trouble I'd be in if he found out?\"\n\n'Exactly, Isabella, if! We only need a wee bit of it, we can just scrape it off of each wheel. I doubt 'e will even know!\" Fi opened up her hands, in which there were little flakes of black rubber. \"Besides, I kind've already did it.\" She ducked as an egg flew by her and out of the window. \n\n\"You shit!\"  Isabella threw another egg, this one hitting the window with a soft splat. \"He will literally go crazy! You know how much that car means to him!\"\n\nFi smirked. \"I think he'll be more pissed of with 'aving to clean your window! But seriously, don't throw that egg, it's the last one.\"\n\nIsabella looked at the egg in her hand. \"Where did you get these from anyway?\"\n\n\"A dead 'en.\"\n\n\"But how did you know it was dead?\"\n\n\"I ate it.\" Seeing the shocked look on Isabellas face, she clarified. \"I mean, me uncle 'as a farm, and he sent this chicken and some of it's eggs to us. I bought some more and, uh, swapped them round. Quite lucky really, didn't fancy killing one meself.\"\n\nIsabella put the egg down, very carefully. She didn't fancy it either. \"Ok then, let's try the spell.\" She took out her iphone, and looked at the site. It had become something of an myth at her school, which had stopped being a myth when Jeremy Woodsman turned Cindy Fletcher into a frog at lunchtime. They had managed to keep her sudden change a secret until turning her back, though Cindy's parents had sent her to counselling to get her to stop eating flies. \n\nThe spell that Fi and Isabella were going to do today was something a lot more impressive. \"So what's the first thing you're gonna do when you turn old?\" Fi asked, as she cracked the egg open. \n\n\"I reckon I'll go to London. That's where all the hot celebs are, after all.\" Isabella continued to stir the boiling mud, sprinkling in daffodils every 7 and a half turns. \n\n\"London? You're so predictable ya twat!\" After spinning 3 times, she dropped the egg into the pot, shell and all. \n\n\"Hey! That better not be swearing I hear!\" Isabella's dad popped his head round the door, the frown on his face disappearing when he saw Fi. \"Oh it's just you Fi, I thought Bella was playing with some of her online friends. Should have recognised the uh...\"\n\n\"Aye, the accent. It's fine.\" Fi said, blocking the view of the pot. \n\nIsabella's dad tried to look at it subtly. \"So uh, what are you two up then? Playing witches?\"\n\nThe two girls looked at each other. \"Yep!\" They chirped in unison. Isabellas dad gave the room one more look, before walking off. Somethings were best not explored. Besides, what was the worse they could do?\n\n\"So what are you going to do then, Miss High and Mighty? Going to go see Ms Bastille and get some advanced french lessons?\"\n\n\"No, shut up! I'm gonna go buy all the horror movies from the shop and then sell watch 'em. Best bit after I've watched 'em I'll sell them to kids on the playground, I'm gonna be minted!\" Fi grinned, as she started thinking about what she could spend her soon-to-be riches anymore. \n\n\"Right then, I think it's ready.\" Isabella said, looking at the slight glow of the muck. \n\n\"Aye, I think you're right! Shall I start reciting the spell?\" Fi said, as she started walking over to the bed with the phone on it. \n\n\"Um, maybe that's not the best idea?\" Isabella said as she sidled closer to her phone. \n\n\"What's that supposed mean?\" Fi sat on the bed, between Isabella and the phone, with purpose. \n\n\"It's just, your accent is really thick, who knows if the spell will work with you saying it?\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me? It's an ancient-ass spell, probably millions of years old.\" She grabbed the phone, and started looking for the incantation. \"You just want to be the \"real\" witch, don't ya?\"\n\n\"So what if I do? It's only fair, it's my phone and my pot.\" She grabbed the pot, and made for the door. \"Besides how can you cast the spell if you don't have the ingredients?\" With that she ran out and started rushing down the stairs. \n\n\"They're not fooking ingredients!\" Fi yelled, as she gave chase. \n\nIsabella made it to the driveway before Fi caught up to her. She grabbed Isabella's legs and the two went flying. Fi landed on Isabella, the phone landed next to the two, and the pot landed on the car. Normally Isabella would have been terrified that her dad's Taurus was covered in mud, but at the moment she too busy fighting for the phone. \n\n\"Ish karoo alop freeda vert schola inter poli broot ba\" The two girls said, pushing eachother out of the way for a view of the cracked phone screen. The mud started to glow, and the car started to rust, slowly at first but soon it was consuming the vehicle from the inside and out. The wheels fell off the axels, the engine fell through to the bottom, and within a few seconds the car had turned to ashes. \n\nFi and Isabella looked at each other, mouths wide open in shock. \"Wait until everyone at school hears about this!\" Fi said, as she stood up and brushed herself off. \n\n\"My dad is going to kill me.\" Isabella said in a strangely neutral tone, as if it was some sort of boring trivia fact. \n\n\"Nah, he'll probably just think it's stolen. You'll be fine, pet.\" Fi helped her friend up off the ground, and gave her a reassuring pat on the back. She looked down at the phone. \"Ooh, that's interesting.\" \n\n\"What is it?\" Isabella started picking up all the stuff outside, when Fi passed her her phone. \n\n\"Site's updated!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432067188", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Either show me the results of a study with your proposed confounding variables controlled for that produces a different result, or sit down and shut the fuck up.  Your idiot opinion is not valid grounds for dismissal, as you would know had you spent your adolescence in a classroom chair instead of underneath your gym teacher's desk fellating his meat whistle.\n\n&gt;You don't intimidate me and your idea of verbal beat down is verbose-flamboyance, totally lacking in substance. Just another political hack with an agenda who pretends to be a tough guy while hiding behind a keyboard. If I had to guess I'd say you were a product of a Bay Area SJW school, and spent too much time hanging out with white Berkeley-ites.\n\n\nHAHAHAHA settle down there Freud, that ain't no cigar you chomping on.\n\n&gt;You use social influence to conceal your intentions and manipulate people into believing they should blame others for everything that doesn't go their way. \n\n\nAwww, thanks for telling me I'm popular and that these guys are all my Mean Girls crew of plastics &lt;3\n\n&gt;Signs of a psychopath.

Just go up to a random person who isn't afk and start saying/emoting with them. Sometimes they will walk off or vanish away without a word and other times they will play along. \"Oh I'm sorry didnt know that about the fish\" or \"I dont care about that law!\" and which time you point at a guard and call for help!\n\nBut my best advice is to come up with the basics of your character and then improvise on that for your extended interactions with people like think of what your character is and stands for then try to act that way in your RP. \n\nI like to use a lot of macros for /yells and things for PVP. I have going into battle quote, I have in battle but need to fight on, I have we just won the fight/skirmish quote, the situation is dire but I will go on, and so on just look at the situations your character is most likely to be in and think of what you would say.\n\nPick a character flaw like I have a macro on my Warlock for when I run into a friendly/enemy mage where I will yell \"Mages! Pathetic users of the Arcane too weak to delve into REAL magic!\" and this will get them intrigued like wtf this dude hates me for being a mage just because he prefers the dark magics?! You're a goblin so maybe you hate taurens for being so much bigger or blood elfs for being too hot.\n\nYou want to create interactions not tell your characters story when trying to initiate random RP in BG, Cities, World...\n\nLike don't go up to someone and start spouting like \"I am Gobsham and I am the best shaman ever because nature loves me and I it.\"\n\nGo up to them and ask a question, call them out, compliment them whatever you think will get a reaction and feedback. \n\nThe other day I was in Thunder Bluff on my tauren paladin and I saw a blood elf so I asked him nicely why he was visiting the city since it is mostly tauren around. He said he was there to acquire the rarest of beefs, clearly indicating he was looking for a black market tauren beef mechant!!! Being a Paladin and a Blood Guard and a fookin legend of TB, I told the blood elf that either he leaves the city peacefully or I will turn him into the guards.  I escorted him out of the city but once I saw he no longer meant to devour the meet of my people and him also being a paladin/remoresful and compliant I blessed him and his entrance to the city once again. Then I said the Light was calling me home and I used Aviana's feather to teleport into the sky and effectively ending the event for him.\n\nThat is another important thing you want to have an exit strategy because nothing is more awkward than RPing with someone randomly and then it just dies and goes no where.\n\nAnother personal example, I have a level 1 tauren named Milkmanjosef who is a milk merchant in Thunder Bluff who has a family to support and you can see the problem, milk is no rare commodity in a city full of tauren so he often must beg random travelers to purchase his goods. Thats all great but what do I do once I sell my milk? Well once someone has agreed to purchase the milk(out of pity) I trade them(if possible) the milk and then I run off while emoting /e Milkmanjosef runs off excited to tell his family the good news foolishly forgetting his payment. Then I come back and proclaim my family is dead for I could not afford to feed them and jump from the cliffs to ease my guilt. Basically have a way to wrap up your interactions if it's going too long or starting to wither as with movies/books/all story telling the ending is a very important part of the story.\n\nI hope this 'insight' helps you enter the world of RP well equipped.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432213773", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "People really have been jumping the gun and making absolute assumptions lately. For some reason, the dislike aimed at the changes and issues with the Dorne Storyline - despite Obara seriously being the only real weak point in that storyline. Be honest. Ellaria has good motivations for letting revenge blind her, and the other sand snakes are pretty good. Tyene's lackluster choreography with her dual daggers is more down to dual daggers being a very weird kind of fighting style and the fact that her style of fighting would need to be more elaborate and showy than KARL FOOKIN' TANNER OF GIN ALLEY'S, seeing as she was trained in combat by Oberyn - who *was equally flashy* - and Karl just got good at alley stabbing.\n\nProjecting your hate of a storyline that is hard to adapt perfectly onto the rest of the season - which has stayed incredibly strong with great character performances and storyline changes that keep the main cast active in the story - is just silly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432214232", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

No mary sue, no stupidly overpowered invincible man, just one dude doing everything he can and getting beaten down over and over again.\n\nThats why it annoys me so much. The whole \"batman is a shit character he's so overpowered\" gets upvoted and agreed with and the people who actually read batman comics are like u wot m8, its just so far from the truth", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432247922", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

And have played MMOs,Mobas&amp;RTS games for over two decades now regularly online so I'm well aware(in my own way) of how diff countries and player-bases behave online. \n\nFor example that most dutch people speak English better then Brits and so on. But its still a factor to take into account, I was in a dutch guild in two MMOs(great people) but still obviously they preferred to speak in native language, and trolling and ranting in English was a pain and effort for alot of em especially since 90% of trolling and flaming in games is slangs and acronyms and so on, which differ from culture to culture. People who troll and flame tend to be little cheeky cunts and lazy people too, quick to blame and give up. They are also the type of people that wont do something if there is one iota of effort involved, and typing a language that isn't your own to people that aren't from your country can fall into that alot of the time.\n\nThat and people troll in Spanish and German and Russian and if you don't speak those language you tend to ignore it. And vice versa for a German kid who doesn't understand some English kids slang, whats a cockbag?\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432304284", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's just a matter of preference, of choosing your own playstyle. Of course, each of them have their respective pros and cons, but I personally do not think one of them is objectively better than the other.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSingle tapping is more consistent than alternating. It is also much easier to master than alternating; because, frankly, it's simpler. Think about streaming: it's hard to do consistently when you first started playing, isn't it? You are either not quick enough, or you overshoot and overstream. Or your index finger doesn't obey your brain and doesn't want to come down on the x key for whatever reason. Or you just give up and spam both keys at once and hope for the best. Or your aim messes up. The point it, single tapping relies on the muscles on a single finger, while streaming, as well as alternating, relies on two. Alternating also requires one to *coordinate* those two different muscles on two different fingers to the degree of perfection that you basically use those two in conjunction as one. That, mate, is fucking difficult.  \n\n\nBUT.  \n\n\nAlternating is faster, for obvious reasons: you're basically streaming low bpm. It allows one to play songs that are faster and requires faster fingers. Many players switch from single-tapping to alternating when they notice that said fingers just aren't fast enough to single-tap high bpm, which bottlenecks their skill level. Others just forces themselves to single-tap faster, slowly but surely getting faster through sheer, brute, RSI-inducing effort.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlternating also makes use of both fingers in equal proportion, and essentially doubles one's stamina. In particular, for songs with a fast tempo or for marathon maps, many players won't have the stamina to single tap that rapidly or for such a long time, and as such they stream the spaced 1/2 notes by alternating.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you're asking me, I single-tap. I can single tap 240 bpm; that's just how my fingers work. Even though that's not the fastest there is (doomsday has fooking insane fingers m8), that's fast enough for most songs and I'm satisfied with them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJudging by your rank, you haven't been playing for long, and so I'll recommend you to try both for some time. Get to know your capabilities better before you settle in on any one particular playstyle. Maybe you have god fingers with god single-tapping stamina; maybe you don't. Maybe you've played the piano before and knows how trills work and can alternate with no problem at all. Maybe you play mouse only.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntl;dr: Play more mate!

Did I suddenly get sent t'Dorne?'**\n\n\"I'll be sure t'give it a try. Can't say I'm to skilled, though.\" He gave a polite bow to his brother. After the snake slithered away, he turned his eyes to his sister. **'A mute, eh? Poor thing, she's been broken even longer than I have...'** \n\nHis eyes regained the warmth they had as he looked at Selyse. \"A pleasah t'meet ye... eh, sister. I appolagize for the way I speak, I wasn't quite taught by scholahs.\" He chuckled, resting his fist on his hip again. \"As our... fatha told me, I won't be joinin' ye' at the castle. So ye can rest easy at night knowin' that a giant won't be eatin' ye stores of food.\" He chuckled again, slowly looking towards Artys, following his movement. \"Or suffah m'presence in general.\" His eyes dulled again, his smile dying away. \n\n\"It's a pleasah though, truly, t've meet ye though. It's a strange feelin', to have grown up never seein' brothers or sistahs, and suddenly having them right in front of ye eyes.\" He sighed, looking to see if Selyse would have any kind of response.

{"body": "also do note  that you now do less, much less damage to crystal during the early game. You don't get 200% from 2 towers, 3 even.  It is essential that your team hold on to 2-2 towers, or ensure 3-1 to your side, otherwise it's going to be an uphill battle trying to take back a tower. The crystal damage will scale up massively over time, so that later in the game the tower becomes much, much easier to take.  Same with reactor, rushing won't work.\nIt's basically Freejam's way of saying: FITE YOU FOOKIN PUSSIES.  The period after both teams secure 2 tower each should be the time you should be mowing down each other and gain OC with the 2 tower boost. If you start off with a 3-1, then ooh boy, you're gonna have a heyday, cuz you have passive OC gain, and the enemy don't have OC booster. your team will be 3 levels above the enemy average at all time, so that's why fighting in the early game is so important. The 3rd tower means a lot, and it's also why it's harder to take in the early game, when the OC booster and generator are massive advantages.

Although Mr. Dozens is quite a secure man, I don't think restoring feeling is something I could bring up without him feeling confused and slightly put off. I mean, if he turned to me one day and said, \"hey, here's this cool way to improve your vagina,\" I would probably be like, \"u wot mate? The fuck's wrong with my vagina?\". I know I can't 100% understand what it's like to have a penis, so although I would love to do anything I could to help enhance his sexual experience, I would worry that the damage bringing this up could do to his penis's self esteem would outweigh the benefits it could bring to the way he experiences sex.

{"body": "* Panel 1 - Translation: \"Greet! I am Sky/God/Day. You know me as Universe\". Universe is bluer here than when you last saw it. That's because I actually drew portions of this comic before I even started on [Size Doesn't Matter](http://redd.it/36kqlb), which ended up featuring a much greyer space color.\n\n* Panel 2 - T: \"My Mother and Father are dead\"  \nUniverse's mother (left) experienced [Heat Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe), expanding until no meaningful particle interactions could occur within her. Universe's father (right) died prematurely when a true vacuum nucleated within his [false vacuum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum) substrate (that's why his insides are transparent, like the void in which the Universe lives).  \nHow did two universes come together to birth our Universe? I'll tell you when you're older.\n\n* Panel 3 - T: \"And my sister and brother are... strange\"  \nTriniverse is speaking complete jibberish. The hypercube universe is saying \"u wot m8\" in a certain reconstructed language. You get a cookie if you figure out which one.  \n(And yes, the other universe is a hypercube. Call him Jewniverse if you must.)\n\n* Panel 4 - T: \"I am alone.\"\n\n* Panel 5 - T: \"But I can into not alone!\"\n\n* Panel 6 - T: \"I bear light.\"  \nThe little globs of light that have eyes in them are Galaxy Clusters. I don't know what language to have them speak if I ever do a comic that deals with them.\n\n* Panel 7 - T: \"I bear stars!\"  \nSay hi to Andromeda and Milky Way! Our vantage point on them has changed since Size Doesn't Matter, so now Andy's facing the camera while Milky Way is at an angle.\n\n* Panel 8 - T: \"I bear suns!\"  \nI drew in little eyes for all those yellow dwarfs around the galactic center only to realize they're completely invisible when zoomed out.\n\n* Panel 9 - T: \"And I bear moons!\"  \nUniverse considers all planets to be moons.\n\n* Panel 10 - T: \"I bear Earth! And most heavy/important, I bear... others!\"\n\n* Panel 11 - This is the panel I took the longest on, as well as my first proper polandball drawing. The goal was to figure out as many horrible and/or petty and/or annoying stereotypes as I could fit into the space immediately surrounding Germany. Germany had to be there to point out that 'Die Uber-voice' is indeed speaking in Engrish that incorporates vocabulary from [**Proto Indo-European**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language), the reconstructed language thought to be the root of everything from Latin to Ancient Greek to Sanskrit. Remember how the Galaxies spoke Latin? This is that, taken to 11. Germany is the one to point it out because most of the major work done on reconstructed PIE in the 19th and 20th centuries was by German linguists.  \nThe dialogue was written using reference from [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_vocabulary), which I recommend browsing, if just to look at all the cognates that have survived for thousands of years.\n\n* Panel 12 - Universe listens to the life it harbors.\n\n* Panel 13 - Universe regrets the life it harbors.\n\n* Panel 14 - 65 million years ago is of course a reference to the [Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) (aka the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs). Evidently Universe didn't care for sauropod squabbles any more than it cares for ours.\n\n* Panel 15 - Ahh... silence.\n\n* Panel 16 - T: \"Like I said...

{"body": "U wot m8!  :) alright then .  First sorry if my English writing is bad . Get ready for the fucking novel here: \n\nSo let me see you have three weeks which is awesome and there is plenty of time to visit everything. \nAnd you are coming in September and that means summer season will be coming to an end and there will be fewer tourists on the road, and will be less traffic. \nCouple of things to consider before starting your trip:\nDifferent currencies, most of them use Euros, and some of them only local currency. \nLong lines and waiting at customs,  (sometimes up to 3-4 hours)  but hopefully it will go very fast\nDriving can be really exhausting, for example Zagreb – Budapest is  at least 4 hours plus customs. \nRent a car is is really weird in this area,  [this]( http://rs.sixt.com/php/reservation?language=en_GB) is one of the best , and the only problem is that if you pick up your car at one country i don’t think you can drive to another and drop it of at some of their other location. \n\nIf your starting point is \n\n1. **Ljubljana** capital of Slovenia the city is really beautiful and a lot places to see however.  Slovenia itself has a lot of national parks, lakes, nature and oh amazing caves, countryside which are a MUST SEE but you won’t have time for all of that and if I would visit Slovenia I wouldn’t bother only going to Ljubljana , but everything is pretty much close so this is a must see:\n[Bled lake]( http://www.bled.si/en/) ,\n[Postojinska jama Cave]( http://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/) , \n[National park Triglav]( http://www.tnp.si/national_park/) ,\nOr checkout some other places on their official  [travel site]( http://www.slovenia.info/)\n\n2. Next stop **Zagreb** capital of Croatia [travel info](http://www.zagreb-touristinfo.hr/&amp;lang=en)\nWhat it has to offer:  a lot of monuments, history,  awesome night life, museums, coffeshops, \nRestaurants, etc.  basically sightseeing  , walk everywhere, stop by to  r/Croatia and get a lots of advices for what to see and where to go.\n\n3. Next stop **Budapest** , capital of Hungary,  Budapest  is really \n[really amazing city](http://imgur.com/a/vtzI6) it is truly inspiring,  its full of restaurants, museums, sights, pubs, and what not.  [their travel info]( http://www.budapest.com/) .  You can also checkout r/Hungary and get a lots of advice's on what to see . Party is a must!  \n\nRomania  hmm , Romania is nice, also a lot of national parks, etc.  buut I would rather skip that, save myself time, money and visit another time, and went straight to \n\n\n4.**Belgrade** The capital of Serbia, its fucking amazing, starting from its history, culture, amazing food, beautiful women , (and men) great music, nightlife , it has everything for everyone. Checkout travel info [here]( http://www.tob.co.rs/en) Danube river, restaurants on the river, shopping, everything is pretty much cheap. \n\n\n5.**Bulgaria** seaside (Varna and Suncev Breg - Sunny Beach )  I will be honest here Bulgarian sea (black sea) is really bad comparing to Greece , Croatia, Montenegro, its more dirty and less enjoyable. Why people go there? Because its cheap as fuck, food is cheap, drinks are cheap, accommodation everything.   now if you are driving or taking a bus from Belgrade, it’s up to 10h of driving , and then you might rest in Sofia Capital of Bulgaria and do a little bit of sightseeing. \n\n\n\n6.**Skopje** The capital of Macedonia the city is not so big, and I am sure you can see everything in about couple of hours, the country has 2 million people. So  if you wanna check that out then you can do it in one day, but I would highly suggest that you visit Lake Ohrid [more info here]( http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/ohrid-lake.nspx)\n\n\nMoving on.. that’s pretty much it and you can go straight to **Montenegro**  and then Croatia **Dubrovnik**  somebody mentioned Kosovo, there isn’t anything there really . this is first time i’ve heard somebody visited Kosovo for tourism, the borders are little bit wired, and strange, not sure how will you get from Skopje to Montenegro, Driving threw Albania would may be the best option, :) \nDubrovnik is really a highlight of everything, amazing place, safe travels mate, and have fun!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions will be more than happy to answer.\nedit: formatting and spelling ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432487312", "subreddit": "travel", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

No. But did he have sufficient pretext to be miffed? Abso-fucking-lutely.

{"body": "&gt;Simply wanting to do things differently but can't doesn't mean you are discriminated against.\n\nU wot? \n\nDiscrimination\n[dih-skrim-uh-ney-shuh n] \n\n1. treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit:\n\n2.\nthe power of making fine distinctions; discriminating judgment: \n\nDiscrimination is any treatment of any individual or group that that is dissimilar from any other individual or group. For instance, citizens of a country are positively discriminated by their government while tourists are negatively discriminated (stay limits, less protections etc). \n\n&gt;The person who felt discriminated against was able to do that activity exactly as everyone else was allowed to do.\n\nThat person didn't *feel* discriminated against, they were discriminated against. And Now EVERYONE is able to do even more things. You still have not presented any argument that these are additional right afforded to only once group in society. What happened afforded everyone in society more legal freedoms, not just one group.\n\n&gt; Are pedophiles being discriminated against? How about necrophiliacs or polygamists zoophiles? We as a society don't allow marriage for any individuals having this brand of sexual attraction.\n\nThe slippery slope argument? Really? However if you really want an answer to this baseless and tired argument, here it is: Marriage is a legal contract. As such all parties to that legal contract must be equal since contracts by law must give equal rights and responsibilities to both parties, otherwise they are void. In order to enter into such a contract, the parties must therefore be able to consent to it. Consent is define as the ability to make sound decisions without coercion. Therefore children cannot enter into contracts as they are legally not people since they cannot under any circumstance give consent. Animals are furthermore considered objects in law and therefore also can never give consent. Lastly the dead are no longer living and therefore cannot express consent so they too cannot enter into marriages (except under very specific circumstances where they expressed consent immediately prior to death in some countries [like France]). So your examples of pedophiles, zoophiles and necrophiles is entirely moot since not all parties in those cases could give the consent necessary to enter into contracts. Equal marriage ont heotherhand is not limited by those terms since its illegality rested not on the legal basis of marriage contracts, but specific exclusionary language that can easily be rectified. Furthermore that language itself only appeared after the 24th Council of Trent, which served only to specified previous ambiguous marriage law.  \nSo, once again, try harder and open a book once in a while, you may learn something.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432539276", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Purely a suggestion on my part: build muscle first. \nWhy is this important? Muscles need more calories, therefore you're burning more calories just by having more muscles. You're also trying to lose fat too, so cardio is obviously the answer, however there's a fine line here you don't want to cross.  \n\nCardio can also wreck your gains (your muscles) by taking away the calories they need to grow. Ideally, you want to be weight training, and doing anywhere between 15-30 mins of medium intensity cardio after weight training. Calorie counting is important but don't obsess over it. I've found that eating a good protein (eggs, chicken, beef, fish - non-processed) portion, plus a cup or two of vegetables/salad does the trick for me. If you're comfortable with eating carbs, go ahead, although I would suggest limiting carbs to breakfast and lunch, and perhaps having a banana 15mins prior to your workouts. Protein shakes help too.  \nSupplement wise, I've found what works for me, but I'll let you know what I take and you can decide if this is what you want. \n\n-Quadra Lean. - It's a non-stimulant fat burner, but really, you forget to eat while taking it! That's not always a good thing if you're trying to build muscle, but like I said, get your protein and vegetables in and you should be fine. \n\n-Quest Nutrition Bars: Holy sheeeeyat! You want dessert? That's your dessert right there! These protein bars are fooking delicious, mate, fooking delicious! These bars don't have a lick of artificial crap in them and they taste amazing.   \n\n-Whey protein shakes: Really, pick one that you'll like. For me, that's Lee Labrada's brand. They taste better than your run of the mill and can be used as a meal replacement.   \n\nOther than that, I say carry with what you're doing. You seem to be winning, and developing a booty to be the envy of many, but seriously, if you haven't started already, get to lifting weights. \nI'm pretty much on the same journey as you, so you have my support, and you have my best wishes for you to attain your goals.

He contemplated what to write on Reddit and wondered if it would be downvoted. He recalled the unfortunate episode where he shared an unpopular opinion regarding a controversial topic (which for the sake of mystery won't be mentioned until thirty chapters in, when he's raging at his TV while playing a video game which promises death over and over, but won't be mentioned here because copyright law) and was downvoted to oblivion.

First one key, then the next, then the next. He wondered to himself how such clicking can form words and coherent sentences on the screen.

He thought about his friend and how they met back in the day, when an event that will be the subject of a future flashback will unnecessarily explain their first meeting, which is pretty dull really and not at all worthy of a flashback, but will act as useless filler between future chapters when the protagonist and his friend disagree on who gets to choose the evening's movie. A really intense disagreement that leads to them not watching a movie and instead talking about movies. Speaking of movies, he wondered what the creative process is.

{"body": "Taking your points in order:\n\n5. You're trying to build xbox live into a pen-and-paper realm. This isn't a bad thing, but think about the competitive games on xbox live. If you're going to step out of the gate and take a neutron blast to the head, it's a game without much in the way of character creation. On the other hand, if you're going to spend an hour making your avatar, most likely you're not going to engage in PvP too early, or too often.\n\n4. The main issue, in every ruleset and every campaign where PvP comes up, is the \"casual vs powergamer\". In other words, someone who spends half the day making their ideal character for a roleplaying game getting steamrolled by someone who spent ten minutes and banged out the most powerful character the rules would allow. You can say \"Our rules are new so no one knows them yet\" ... but that won't always be the case.\n\n3. 10-16 players. If they're going to be fighting among themselves, you need enough people involved that it's just mass chaos, without any expectation of finding the whatchamacallit that the king asked them to go get, rather than something personal. Otherwise people will get upset and choose to play something else.\n\n2. In my estimation, nine times out of ten when a party turns on themselves it's because the game master failed to keep them engaged. For every time Boromir would have the ring for Gondor, there's a dozen 'u fukn wot m8?' encounters where the GM doesn't do a good job introducing the characters to each other, and doesn't do anything to maintain control when two figures meet in the dark alley for the first time.\n\ncont'd: It's going to be nearly impossible to create a set of rules that can't be abused. Someone is going to become familiar with them, and they're going to pick attributes and traits and even disadvantages with an eye towards maximizing their player killing potential.\n\nThere's a reason that companies like Blizzard spend years bringing a PvP rpg to market, and that's because it's all about balance, balance, balance.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432724454", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No in Cockney it's something like \"facking\". At least that's what people will hear if they're not Cockney themselves. People have taking to writing fooking when trying to transcript British accents because of the foot-strut merger. This makes the words put (as in place something down) -putt (as in golf) homophones. However this isn't present in Southern accents and starts around Birmingham. Cockney, and other working class SE accents, have their own wide range of phonetic changes, one of them includes the movement of the -putt vowel (but not the -put vowel given these are southern accents) to a sound much closer to -ah, which makes people write facking. \n\nOther changes are the -hot vowel can sound like the -caught vowel  \nThe -bad vowel can sound like the -bed vowel  \nWords with a pronounced -r (only before a consonant sound given it's a non-rhotic accent), are often pronounced with a labiodental approximant making it sound like -w to some.  \nA tendency to change dark -l (occurring at the end of a consonant sound), so it also sound like a -w. Salt sounds like sawt.  \nTh-fronting, by why the -th sound used in thing can be made to sound like an -f as in \"fings\" rather than \"things. Also the other -th sound can be made to sound like a -v but only it's in the middle of a word, as in \"brother\" &lt; \"bruvver\". Sometimes the \"brother\" -th is made to sound like a -d at the start of a word since -v is never used here.    \nh-dropping naturally   \n-t that appears anywhere but the beginning of a vowel is replaced with a glottal stop \n\nSo if we wanted the Yanks to get it's right they'd need to say.\n\nAw-whi?e gavnah.

{"body": "You got it: \n\nTL;DR Didn’t read the books, but want to learn some trivia? Read on!\nSpoiler-free experience guaranteed (terms and conditions might apply).\n\nThe Followup series are nearing an awkward moment where the show catches up to the books. This does not mean there will be no source material to bring up, as trivia and details from the past are still relevant, but without the direct book-to-show comparison the volume of particular articles will diminish in a slight, but noticeable way. Unless The Winds of Winter get released before season 6 airs, in which case several people will eat their hats or some other funny inedible objects.\n\nGoodnight, Sweet Prince\n\nIt’s dragonglass. I hope you don’t need them\nSamwell Tarly, invoking a such apparent use of Chekhov’s Gun that it might as well have been a red herring\n\nJon is going beyond the Wall again — it’s the third time he does that in company, and only once he wasn’t in charge of the party. Fun fact: both expeditions led by Jon are show-only content. Last season we had a similar “filler” subplot with the raid to Craster’s keep. It had its problems, there was a moment of awkwardness when Bran and Jon passed each other on the way, and the Bolton spy Locke wasn’t particularly interesting, but Karl fookin’ Tanner saved the sequence. All things considered, it was a “filler” for all intents and purposes other than tying up Locke’s role, but it was introduced to the show for a good reason — keeping Bran and Jon doing something, as their book material was almost entirely utilized in season 3.\n\nJon going to Hardhome is hardly a filler, though. It’s a replacement for what the books had going for him at the Wall with Melisandre, Selyse and Shireen staying there, Mance’s wife, the alternative “sacrifice the child to save the world” dilemma with Mance’s newborn son, and, at this level of divergence it’s safe to say, Mance himself. That is correct: book Mance is alive and well, but everyone believes him to be dead. Melisandre actually switched him with Rattleshirt, and, thanks to her magical glamour, nobody has noticed the difference. Together with Jon they devise a plan to infiltrate Winterfell: Mance comes there with a few spearwives, disguised as a minstrel (he is a decent singer himself). The “external help” element at Winterfell got taken over by Brienne, and the general “no magic” policy led to the glamour switch being written out completely.\n\nIn the end, it makes lot of sense — even in the books, there is someone from the Night’s Watch going towards Hardhome (Cotter Pyke, commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea), and there is an expedition from Castle Black led by Tormund. The details of this difference will be described once we reach the conclusion of A Dance with Dragons, which should be a common point for both the show and the book (and might not even be the last scene at the Wall of the season, meaning that the show could spoil the future events, not written in the books yet).\n\nAemon’s death, even though in a different place, occurs under very similar circumstances. Both Sam and Gilly are there, and the famous touching line “Egg, I dreamed I was old” made it into the show without change. Contrary to the “Inside the Episode” video by HBO, this isn’t the only “peaceful” death the show ever had — Hoster Tully died of old age as well, although that was off screen. Again, I have to leave you guys hanging with describing the details of Aemon’s death, as it’s part of a separate development that has been pushed to a later moment — one of the last few episodes of this season. We’ll bring that up once we get there, but no promises on when would that be exactly.\n\nSam and Gilly’s encounter is another bit of TV-only content that actually makes very much sense considering the circumstances. Book Stannis leaves his wife and daughter with a decent force of knights, which makes the place a bit safer. The confrontation with the brothers of the Night’s Watch has been foreshadowed; Stannis correctly judged them as murderers and rapists, stating his reason for taking his family with his army. Overall this bit adds to development of both Sam and Gilly, considering their book development is put “on hold”, if happening at all.\n\nWinter Is Co… Practically Here Already\n\nIt can. It can always be worse\nTheon “Reek” Greyjoy, well aware of what could have happened to Sansa if the story of Jeyne Poole got adapted with all its details\n\nIn terms of raw plot progression, Winterfell is all buildup and no resolution… yet. There is no common plot point with the books so far, and you guys really don’t want to hear about the parallel story and what Jeyne Poole (she marries Ramsay posing as Arya Stark) has endured. There’s also still a possibility that some of the abuse on Jeyne might make into the show onto Sansa or Myranda.\n\nPerhaps I was wrong with assessing Sansa as more aware, cold-hearted and determined, which kinda undermines my own interpretation of last week’s final scene. Since it’s all completely show-only content, I’m in the same boat as you guys, picking up the clues and pretty much guessing what matters and what doesn’t.\n\nRight now we should probably start worrying about the possibility of her getting pregnant, although Westeros knows a very reliable form of birth control called “moon tea,” a special brew made by maesters for women who want to avoid pregnancy. It’s never explicitly said what it is, but it’s most likely an abortifacient. We’ll bring this detail up later in this post.\n\nWe Are Marching In The Light Of Lord\n\n\nHave you lost your mind?\nStannis, steadily climbing in popularity ranks even amongst the non-readers\n\nAs mentioned in the Wall section, book Shireen and Melisandre are both at the Wall. This does not mean Shireen is not in danger (au contraire, I’d say, her fate is very much open to any potential development). Since we’re clearly treading on show-original territory, all’s fair in this game. I have my guesses on where is Melisandre’s subplot going, but it’s a few episodes too early to talk about that. We haven’t made much progress with Stannis’s storyline (well, he’s literally stuck in the snow), and even having read the books I have no idea what the big picture is. He might do the book stuff, he might try to do the book stuff with different results, he might do something else entirely – like I’ve said, it’s show-original content and anything can happen. All in all, we can’t discuss much about Stannis himself.\n\nA reminder, then: seasons in this world last for years. That’s correct, years. It’s been autumn since the the beginning of season 2, and the uncommon climate of Westeros allows for a very vague timeline, especially when Littlefinger gets from Winterfell to King’s Landing in two episodes, while it took a month for King Robert to do so. Books keep a much tighter grip on the flow of time, but it also means that characters who were originally meant to grow up during the planned timeskip, didn’t. The timeskip plan failed and now we have a fifteen year old Daenerys ruling Meereen, fourteen year old Sansa getting engaged (not yet married in the books, and definitely not to Ramsay), and ten year old Arya training to become a faceless assassin. So in a way, the fact that show characters grew up older than their book counterparts is a good thing.\n\nLong autumn means several crops and an immense stock of supplies in granaries. Winterfell, for example, has an entire town rise around it during winter, as people from all the countryside in the North gather up for the long cold. The details of agriculture and logistics aren’t described in an exceptionally profound way, but you can imagine how difficult it is to feed people during such a long winter and how important it is to have a political stability when such time arrives.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432756766", "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "score": 41, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"YEER JUS A GOT! Don;t think yu can jus lk at the fookin DOVAHKIN liek dat!\" The Dragonborn roared at the goat while picking himself up from the outside of the tavern. The guard just took a look at the dilapidated hero, shook his head, and went back inside. The cold everwinter of Winterhold still roared, and began it's grasp on his body despite his belly full of sweet honey mead. He shivered with his lack of clothing.\n\n\"*Kraah*\" The goat bayed. The Dragonborn did a tactical roll, flanking the goat.\n\n\"HAHA! A frosh dRAhgon-got I see! Havnnt seen ona yu sinc I FOOKIN KILLED ALDUIN. DAS RIGHT. Il sow YU frosh breth! FO-KRAH-DIIN!\" He shouted, but stumbled before he completed his phrase. The frost breath barreled into the tavern walls, while the Dragonborn once again found himself on the ground, this time his helmet rolling off his head. He started to pick himself up another time, but let his face hit the cold, hard ground as he began to cry. There were no more battles left to be fought, yet here he remained. Alduin had been defeated, the Rebellion was successful, and the old monsters of Skyrim had long been slain. He had fulfilled his purpose in this world, but he was still left unaged and unchanged. Yet the world changed around him. Emperors rose and fell, new evils appeared, and the Elder Scrolls were always in danger, being saved at the last moment by a new hero. Solace in his friends died long ago, as well. The heroes of his glory days were now all in the ground, topped by glorious statues and flowers. Ever since Ysolda died, he didn't even have a house to go home to anymore. All he had left was the drink and the dying hope a new purpose would appear. And now here he was, dueling a goat.\n\n\"*Kraah Kraah*\" The goat bayed once more.\n\n\"sHOot op, drahgon-got. Leav me be. I jus wana be useful agin. Oh Akatosh, letmeh speak dis gots language so he kan jus leav me be.\" The Dragonborn plead. Suddenly, a bright light surrounded him. \n\n~*SO SHALL IT BE*~ A voice roared, booming throughout the land.\n\n\"dam Shulda asssked fur ysolda back.\" The Dragonborn thought to himself.\n\n\"*I may not be able to do that, but I can give you a purpose.*\"\n\n\"wUH?\" The Dragonborn blinked, then blinked again as the goat's black eyes penetrated his.\n\n\"*Do not be afraid. I am a super mutant goat, from a land known as New Vegas, where the law of the land is death, and it's populace cry for a hero every day. Some come, but they are mortals, dying as they walk into the sunset with their dogs. Our world needs your help, Dragonborn.*\" The goat spoke, eloquently and pleadingly. The Dragonborn sat still for a moment, then reached for his helmet.\n\n\"Lesh go\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432868897", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

We don't celebrate November 5th, which is when England does it, so for some reason Halloween is full of sweets, dressing up and fireworks. Honest, I miss the feeling of dressing up as scary monsters and it sounding like a war zone. Good times! But I digress.\n\nOne year it fell on one of their sermon nights. We were launching fireworks as usual and they called the police, complaining about the noise. There was a knock on our door, it was the police asking us to stop setting off the fireworks. My dad calmly pointed up and down the street to all the other fireworks going off and suggested that if they can stop everyone, then we'll stop - but if not, then it wouldn't be fair.\n\nThe police agreed, wished us a happy Halloween and went on their way. My dad was not best pleased, though.\n\nFor some reason, we had a long cardboard tube - I think a poster came in it or something. My Dad had a genius idea - take a rocket, light it, drop it in the tube and aim it at the fucking Jehova's.\nWe spent hours bouncing rockets off their roof. Every now and then they'd come out to investigate, I don't think they realised what was going on. Presumably they thought it was the rapture or something. Serves them right, the cheeky cunts.\n\nBest Halloween ever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432996093", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "score": 88, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This isn't technically something that I've walked in on, but have been on the other end of. Hopefully it still applies.\n\nShort background: notorious prankster, pain in the ass kid, etc etc\nBand geek \n\n(CLICHÉ; fuck you) BAND CAMP. My sophomore year of high school. The actual 'camp' was held at a fairly local college during the summer when the dorms were available.. Roommates were chosen alphabetically. My last name starts with BA, so the last person in line with the A in their name was chosen to be my roommate for the week, or whatever. This little cheeky cunt's last name was Areola. No shit, Areola. Not really relevant, but at the time as a young man, I found that shit hilarious. Anyway, he was a bright kid with good grades and his family always tried to be super involved with our music program whether it was fundraising help or being a chaperone for field trips, whatever. Anyway, his mother, Mrs. Areola was a chaperone during band camp that year, and her main job consisted of staying up on the graveyard shift, making sure none of the kids were having sex or doing drugs, you know. She didn't do an awesome job at it, but she was there. She was also in charge of waking everyone up ensuring a timely breakfast and other morning routines, etc..\n\nWell, one of the mornings after a late night filled with all kinds of things a teenage boy at band camp shouldn't be doing, breakfast comes around REAL quick. She's knocking on the door, Little Areola erects instantaneously and is right out the door, ready to go. He forgot his key, which they only gave you two of. VERY STRICT don't lose our fucking keys policy, mind you. They didn't keep spares, and charged HELLA if you needed a replacement. I was in the room pretty much in hibernation at this point, locked in and no one was getting in unless I opened the door. Anyway, my body needed to reset so it did its thing. When I finally came to, I hear the kraken being unleashed on the other side of this door, and all hell absolutely breaking the fuck loose. I quickly stumble to the door, and open it. There stands Mrs. Areola, red as a Wendy's sign, screaming at the top of her lungs. It didn't last long. She stumbled over her words as she held this face of absolute disgust and confusion that went back to anger momentarily, but kind of just walked away as she face palmed a bit, and said \"JUST-JUST-just GET OUT ON THE GOD DAMN FIELD.\" \n\nKind of weirded out, I just closed the door and turned around to get ready for the day, realizing not only did I have extreme, rock hard fucking morning wood, it was flag-poling out straight through the gap in my boxers. Furthermore, amongst the activities of the night prior, I also unintentionally must have taken someone's virginity, or the bitch gave 0 fucks about her menstrual schedule conflicting with that prime band-camp-D opportunity. As you can probably picture, I had dried blood crusties all over the emperor, all over the shitty ass, barely havin' a button ass boxers I was wearing, down my leg, pretty much just everywhere. Fuck my life. Worst thing ever. What really fucked me though, was the fact that this bitch was confrontational after that... Like we're watching videos from our performance in the theatre, and she feels the need to grow balls within that moment, pause the film, and grab the mic. \"I just wanna take a second here and talk about what a great job you're all doing, the progress everyone is making is excellent. The one thing I'd like to touch on though is the fact that, uh... SOME PEOPLE *wide eyes glaring at ya boy* aren't taking things as seriously as they should... (She waited for a second to start the next sentence) It's NOT FUNNY to show your genitals off to adults, in any situation, it's NOT CUTE. But other than that, you guys are doing a great job, and keep up the good work.\" Me, being the dick I am, and kind of not wanting to get punked in front of the homies, when she's done, I say \"I'm sorry. Mrs. Areola? *hand raised* I think I missed part of that, did you say that you wanted to touch on some people's genitals?\" I would have gotten off more, but the room erupted with laughter. Mom had to come pick me up that night. \n\nTL;DR Band camp chaperone walked in on me having a mess of a bloody dick with major morning wood poking directly through the hole in my boxers. Shameful, really. \n\nIf anyone actually reads this, hope you found it entertaining! It took me a bit to write it down, but definitely nostalgic on my end.\nTotally worth it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1433000658", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For the longest time, I would automatically reach over to the d-pad to taunt after a kill because that's pretty much what taunts were made for. Heck, in Melee you even got a \"Fighter Stance\" bonus in Classic mode if the match ended while you were taunting. Even the higher level computer characters did it! But it's stuff like this post and people getting a little upset over taunts online that's made me try to break my habit because people read to far into them or consider them cocky, and that's just not me or what I'm going for. But in all honesty, we were encouraged by the devs to taunt after kills, so I don't think to much about it.\n\nI do use taunts however for THOSE people on FG (the \"get rekktttt\" type, presumably young high-schoolers) who play only golden C. Falcon, salute at the start of the match, and try to turn the match into a montage of killing combos. They usually suck and have blaring weak points. Then when the match is over and I haven't lost a stock, I taunt repeatedly in a \"u wot m8?\" sarcastic response.

{"body": "The big thing with this fight is to be extremely patient. You're not on a time limit so long as you arent taking needless damage.\n\nIf you see an opening to hit Ornstein but Smough is winding up an attack, dont even risk a single swing. Just back off and wait, because if Smough hits you, that means Ornstein will also hit you while you're recovering, and if you're *really* unlucky, Smough will hit you again after that.\n\nTo go along with patience, bring a bow. Taking potshots while you're at a distance can save you dangerous melee range hits. It wont do a whole lot of damage, but even a single swing's worth of damage can be worth it against this fight. I've lost with only one of them left alive with a sliver of health remaining more times than I can count.\n\nDont use Sorcery or Miracles. Seriously. If you're safe and think you have enough time to use a Heal, trust me: You're not safe. Ornstein sees you using your miracle and is like \"U FOKIN WOT M8\" and impales you with a Lightning Spear 9/10 times if you stand still too long.\n\nTake off all of your armor. ALL of it. Odds are if you get hit at all you're going to die, so the extra mobility is better. \n\nDont get cocky. Just because you think you have a good rhythm going doesnt mean Smough isnt about to play his own rhythm on your face with his hammer in two seconds. Take no risks. Just play it safe.\n\nThere is no rule saying you cant bring a Sunbro. Solaire is right outside the boss gate. He can draw the attention of one of them for a while while you get some free hits in.\n\nThere isnt really a way to make this fight *easy*, just to minimize the mistakes. Ornstein especially will punish you for even the slightest stumble. Kill him first.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1433036505", "subreddit": "darksouls", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}
