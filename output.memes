{"body": "for those who do not want to flip through 4 pages theres a good chance the most powerful chip inside your pc in raw computational terms is on your graphics card so how did graphics get so powerful what are graphics cards good for right now and how on earth do you choose from the baffling array of 3d chipsets on offer\na little history\nthe origin of todays 3d monsters can be traced back to ancient 2d cards designed to improve the resolution and colour fidelity of the pc the very earliest cards had specifications that seem impossibly modest by todays standards\nthe first truly modern graphics processing units gpus arrived in 2001 nvidias geforce 3 and the radeon 8500 from ati were the worlds first gpus to support socalled programmable shaders designed to enable more realistic lighting within graphical 3d simulations since then no other company has been able to keep up with the relentless pace of those two brands though ati was bought by amd in 2006\nearly programmable chips could typically apply their shading effects to just four pixels per operating cycle since then gpus have become ever more powerful programmable and most of all parallel amds radeon hd 4800 for instance packs a ludicrous 800 shader units also known as stream processors in a nod to their increasingly programmable nature\ncurrent cards also sport huge memory buffers as big as 1gb enabling them to drive extremely highresolution displays and are backed up by massive bus bandwidth thanks to the pci express interface in its latest 20 format finally the very latest development in graphics technology is support for multiple cards sharing the rendering load\nbut todays gpus dont just pack painfully powerful 3d pixel pumping engines they also support 2d video decode acceleration for modern hd video codecs like h264 and vc1 as used on bluray movie disks\nthats how graphics cards got to where they are today but what makes the latest chips tick\n3d rendering\nthis is the biggy 3d rendering is the graphics cards raison detre with the launch of windows vista microsoft introduced the 10th iteration of its directx graphics api the dx10 api is now well established and fully compliant cards are extremely affordable theres no need to compromise on directx support\nwhether its pixel vertex and geometry shaders or support for high quality antialiasing and highdynamicrange lighting theyre present in all dx10 gpus what you do need to worry about however is raw rendering horse power and below is everything you need to know to judge a chips performance\npixel throughput\nbroadly speaking its the texture and render output units rops that define the number of pixels a graphics chip can spit out every cycle and remember a 1920 x 1200 pixel grid on a typical 24inch monitor works out at over two million pixels for smooth gaming youll need to refresh that at least 30 times a second in other words well over 60 million pixels per second\nnvidias top chip the £300 geforce gtx 280 has a huge 32strong array of rops and no less than 80 texture sampling and address units amds best the radeon hd 4800 series has 16 rops and 40 texture units facts reflected in pricing that kicks off around the £180 mark\nmidrange cards like nvidias geforce 9600 series and the radeon hd 4600 from amd typically have significantly reduced rop and texture unit counts\nshader processing\nthis is where the real computation grunt is housed and where those shimmering shiny visual effects that dominate the latest games are processed intriguingly amds relatively affordable radeon hd 4800 packs 800 shaders to the nvidia gtx 280s 240 units\nhowever not all shaders are equal and its worth noting that nvidias gpus usually boast much higher shader operating frequencies than competing amd chips again midrange chips typically suffer from cutdown shader counts in an effort to reduce chip size and cost\nmemory\nthe importance of memory for a graphics card is two fold its important to have enough memory to store all the data required to render a given 3d scene on board the graphics card itself the alternative is dipping into the pcs main memory and that means latency lag and stuttering frame rates treat 512mb as a minimum for decent performance in modern games\nthe other half of the story is the related issue of bandwidth keeping all those shaders and rops fed with pixel data takes some serious throughput the latest cards therefore pack ultra fast memory chips that run as fast as 1ghz or more and are able to transmit data at least twice per cycle hence the term ddr or double data rate the latest gddr5 the g stands for graphics is actually capable of four transmits per cycle bus width is another factor that affects bandwidth the more bits the bus supports the more data it can pump per cycle\nthe biggest current bus is the geforce gtx 280s 512bit beast however large memory buses take up a huge amount of space on a graphics chip so the introduction of gddr5 memory will probably see bus technology scale back to 256bit with the next generation of big gpus\nmultigpu\nthe joker in the gpu pack is undoubtedly multigpu technology both of the big boys of pc graphics amd and nvidia offer multigpu platforms in the shape of crossfire and sli respectively the idea is simple enough to use multiple gpus in parallel to provide even more rendering oomph\nwhen they work the results can be spectacular the problem is all too often they dont and you are left with the performance of a single card or worse also note that special supporting motherboards are required and in the case of nvidia that exclusively takes the form of an nvidia motherboard chipset\nintegrated graphics\na final word in terms of 3d performance should go to integrated graphics as found on motherboards in theory they offer the same feature set as discrete gpus however in order to make integrated gpus small enough and cheap enough for motherboards the number of functional units is brutally cut down typically by a factor of 20 or worse compared with the fastest standalone solutions\n2d features 2d acceleration\nfirst up is hardware video acceleration here the two big players are once again fairly level pegging all the latest dx10 boards from both amd and nvidia have builtin 2d engines dedicated to accelerating modern and demanding codecs such as h264 and vc1\n2d features video ports\nvga may have been revolutionary in 1997 but it looks pretty laughable compared to modern digital interfaces today dvi remains the dominant standard on the pc and in duallink form is good for up to 2560 x 1200 pixel resolutions the hdmi standard as used on tvs is also creeping onto some cards especially those designed for use in home theatre pcs and includes both digital video and audio signals\njoining these two well establishing interfaces is displayport think of it as a cross between dvi and hdmi and youll get the idea its intended to be more flexible and support higher resolutions than either dvi or hdmi\nfinally theres the question of support for hdcp encryption required for bluray playback and other protected content most modern cards are hdcp compliant but its a feature thats always worth checking\nform factor and power\ngone are the days of simple singleslot boards that drop into almost any system todays cards vary wildly in size and shape the biggest boards occupy the space of two pci express slots and may be long enough to cause fitting issues in standard atx chassis\nmodern cards also often have mammoth power requirements at least one sixpin supplementary power cable is usually required for a performance card and sometimes more\ngp gpu\nbringing graphics technology full circle is the idea of general purpose computing on the gpu or gp gpu for short as graphics chips have become more programmable the possibility of harnessing their immense parallel processing capabilities for tasks other than graphics has become more attractive\nearly applications are likely to be multimedia related video encoding photo editing ingame physics and artificial intelligence for example nvidia is currently leading the way in gp gpu but such is the expectation of its importance intel has felt the need to get in on the game late next year intels larrabee chip is due to appear with a remit of graphics and gp gpu processing\nthe final reccie\nif thats the state of play in graphics what are the current bestbuy boards nvidias geforce gtx 280 series boards are awfully quick but they are also awfully pricey for that reason amds radeon hd 4870 is our pick from the top end its damned close for performance and nearly half the price at around £180\ndown around the £100 mark the 4870s cheaper 4850 sibling can just about be had and delivers fantastic performance for the money dipping below £100 brings nvidias 8800 gt into play its a slightly older chipset but still a great allrounder especially now that it can be had for a piffling £80 just be sure to get the full 512mb version and not the horrible 256mb hack\nand if even £80 is too much do not despair amd has just released the new radeon hd 4600 series its a very decent performer thanks to no less than 320 stream shaders but it is imperative to go for the faster 4670 variant yours for less than £60 rather than the bandwidthhobbled 4650", "gilded":
