"We are actually very lucky that WWII was so awful. At the end of it all, the entire world saw what happens when you endorse eugenics and what a nuclear war could look like. Germany, Italy, and Japan started WWII, perhaps the most costly wake up call in the world.  Hitler rebuilt Germany which was basically a pile of rubble with people running around in it into the Third Reich, putting an entire country to work with an actual future instead of trading wheel-barrels full of money for bread due to hyperinflation. Then he started the most well known and documented [eugenics and genocide](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f9Det4pyqNE/TH7Ar8qIniI/AAAAAAAAAj8/8coqbcXc-BM/s1600/Shoes+Holocaust.jpg) program in history, as well as the most expensive war in history. This war, World War II, brought the US out of the Great Depression.  At the end of the war, after Hitler died but before Japan surrendered, Japan was nuked twice, in [Hiroshima and Nagasaki.](http://www.gensuikin.org/panel/10-1.jpg) This showed us how a nuclear war would come about.

"I really havent had much trouble healing with it. Given some decently intelligent group members that know their roles (no pun intended), I have no issues. Power management isnt too bad but I do have to be mindful of it without a tank. Unless I'm up against a cr88/89 healer, I can usually keep up on heals. I've found electric healing a pretty nice class to heal with. I like the safety nets and burst healing. I've found that if you use a little planning and strategy, it's pretty easy to heal with.

"Point one, Dota 2 keeps to the characters design, for a more realistic approach to how the hero might dress or look. League of legends comes out with Riot themed heroes to self promote and put  Riot  gear on. They look nothing like their former selves and just serve to make money from skins.  * Dota 2 lets you reskin your hero with [Bounty Hunter w/o Cosmetics](http://i.imgur.com/zI74OdT.png) and [Bounty Hunter with Cosmetics (The set I like to wear, which is 3 different sets)](http://i.imgur.com/rH3J8Xd.png)  As I explained. Once a Nasus in a game gets to a certain amount of farm he does so much damage with his Q that he one shots people. In Dota 2 you can counter this with Ghost Scepter, making you immune to physical damage or BKB making you immune to Magical Damage, giving you time to react to someone that farmed.

"I guess civility is not well-liked where you come from.  Nor, seemingly, is actually addressing my *bloody point:* I am not saying that Linux is equal to Windows. I am saying that, as a free OS with some game compatibility, it can be the more optimal choice for builds with limited funds (such as console-alternatives), as it allows more funds to be put into hardware, followed by a simple switch over to Windows down the line if the user feels that it's worthwhile to them. You have utterly failed to refute this, and instead have attacked an argument I am not trying to make, which, seemingly, you have constructed in your mind and projected onto most of the comments in this thread. I can only conclude that you are either trolling us (in which case, gr8 b8 m8, 8/8), or very, very thick.",0,1390140106,pcmasterrace,0,0
"&gt;I guess civility is not well-liked where you come from.

Oh. I'm not trolling, the simple fact is that SteamOS/Linux is not a viable OS to play games with. Everybody who has told me otherwise so far has actually admitted that they don't use Linux for gaming. Don't you find that slightly odd?  &gt;You have utterly failed to refute this  Have I? How many games work on Linux versus how many work on Windows? Apparently Linux will run a  few hundred , Windows handily exceeded that figure. Last year there were another  few hundred  games that work on Windows released.  People need to stop letting their hopes for the future get in the way of reality.",0,1390140376,pcmasterrace,-1,0

"Let's start with the scripute. I don't want to lose too much time talking about letters, but one has to highlight the way that the beautifully drawn words serve both as an introduction to the main topic of the piece of art, as well as pure eye candy. Nice!  I especially like how the artist depicted the electrostatic vapor. Interesting detail for art geeks: if you look very closely, you will see that the artist chose not to draw the - obviously inferior -  cycle  PBR ( this one is a base/unusual/cursed PBR, it's energy and distinctiveness symbolized by the colour of immemorial king midas). It contrasts this majestic courier's shimmering platinum skin (where did Nomad get this ultra realistic platinum color? looks like from a 10k usd image editing software!) in an outmost perfect and harmonizing way.   Overall a compelling view, this photorealistic baby outshines all other couriers with ease.  Nice that he also used the text color to hint at the PBR's glowing blue eyes. This was probably meant to symbolize the connection between the PBR's innermost identity and the ancient, sacred rite of trading ( the eyes are the windows to the soul ) - genius!   Lastly, I would like to draw the conclusion that the theme of this masterpiece is  realism . From the aforementioned photorealism of the drawing, to the message delivered by reasonable price expactions within the scripture, the artist wanted to let us know how valuable the PBR is to him.  tres bien! I r8 it 8/8.  shouldn't you now propose the next theme/idea/title for someone to accept?",0,1391625205,dota2tradelounge,2,0

"Got one for my birthday on the sixth. Also bought Sonic Lost World and S&amp;ASRT since I didn't want Fifa 2014. Anyway that game is like $4.  Anyway, so far it has been a real blast! The games look absolutely amazing, the play is much better than non Nintendo games and the gamepad *feels just right*! Since the browser supports HTML5 and JavaScript I was able to get Minecraft running, however I needed to use only buttons and needed to remap some. :/  When I wanted to play some games on my computer, I was able to also mirror the software onto the gamepad, and the inclusion of a gyroscope and accelerometer into that let me look around and see with the gamepad whilst having my PC do most of the work. Recording the game was even better as I could record it in 1080p whilst only displaying 480p, letting me get 120 fps average on some games in particular, including sonic generations and S&amp;ASRT.   Playing MKWii in full definition was good, and ran smoothly at 60fps. Unfortunately the move from Wii to WiiU didn't go too well... I had to disconnect the WiiU from the internet and connect the Wii... Didn't work. Oh well...  Much better than the shitty DirectXbox and PlayStation.   For the WiiU I r8 8/8 m8.  It has great games and good 3rd party support. If Java is integrated then I see Minecraft and various other games I love coming to the WiiU, as updated as the versions my PC runs.",0,1397263731,wiiu,1,0

"&gt;I'd say DC 5 total, and they'd only need to make the Perception check to see something in broad daylight in the first place because they're being distracted by  a Fighter in their face  who was magically not there scant moments ago when you were fleeing backwards across a bridge. I smell shennanigans wafting from your table. I wonder what might be the source of all that game imbalance and terrifying Wizards?  The hell are you on about? When was the wizard on his own? I told you about how he would make the fighting guy's job easier - did... did you not fucking read that part? Also, do you have any clue how perception works? DC increases by 1 for every 10 feet; at 50, that's a base of 5. DC increases by 5 for being distracted by the fighter dude, so that's DC 10 minimum Rules as Written.  Here's the perception rules, in case you need to brush up. +5 distance, +5 distract, +5 EDIT: Sorry, unfavorable conditions (being that a fighter is blocking direct LoS to him). I started it at the base DC because there aren't actually any base for noticing when an illusion freezes. Noticing a visible creature is there has a 0 base, but this goes into seeing details about them, which isn't given.  http://paizo.com/prd/skills/perception.html  &gt;(roll that Bluff or Intimidate check for me against their Sense Motive...  http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate  Huh. It appears that intimidate doesn't work that way. It's DC 10 plus their wisdom modifier plus their hit die.  http://paizo.com/prd/skills/bluff.html  Bluff does though. But fine, yeah, you're right, shades doesn't work that way and can't summon a dragon. My bad - I rarely use illusions, because conjuration is love, conjuration is life.  &gt;From what I've seen you post so far, I'm frankly embarrassed that you claim to be playing Pathfinder at all, and/or flat out mystified as how you are under that impression in the first place.  Rules light ?? How about Magical Teaparty Storytime And Fuck The Rules™? In which case... how dare you lecture me about the published rules??  gr8 b8 m8 i r8 it 8/8.  But all jokes aside... let's see - we use the entirety of the core framework, except we generate HP with average round up. We give Dex to Damage with weapon finesse to keep finesse fighters from getting screwed into using scimitars only. Spells are kept hard in line and more liberal interpretations (such as the Sun Cannon or the Anti-Osmium Bomb) get smacked down unless we're deliberately being silly (like level 20 fightan time feature Buddy Jesus, Zordon, Not!Green Arrow, Level 20 Dwarf Fighter, and DRORIG FJORDSON, CHAMPION OF THE RIGHTEOUS). You have to touch an illusion or make a fairly high perception check to notice it's off in the heat of battle. (Oh no, the guy I was barely paying attention to fifty feet away while I'm toe to toe with a dude with a hugeass sword stopped moving. Maybe he's waiting for the shot? Maybe he's contemplating betraying his comrade, since we outnumber him? Maybe he's hoping we see him not acting against us, and wants to surrender? Maybe it's an illusion. Fuck. I dunno!)  I mean, we hardly throw the rules out the window. But if something would be cool, we look for a way to do things by the numbers, and nudge things if we have to and the coolness isn't egregrious. Dude gets a nat 20 with a vorpal weapon, cuts off their leader's head in the surprise round? Yeah, he gets a free intimidate against his men. Illusionist makes illusory dragon on a bridge roar at enemies? Yeah, it rolls the dragon he's mimicking intimidates against all of them - shit be scary, yo.  EDIT: AH! THere we are. You seem to have misinterpretted the bit where  their fleeing across the bridge as the same scenario as when they were in the thick of the fight. Sorry, those were two separate times, different things going on, should have made that clearer. In one case, the first round consists of Trixie Arcanas using a quickened greater invisibility, while casiting a minor or major illusion of herself where she was, and then moving. During this round, the fake her is moving - drawing her bow and possibly taking aim for that one teamwork feat that deals more damage when she attacks on an allies turn (enemy doesn't know what feats or class she is). Then Archie Hunter starts firing off his arrows. Then Fightan MacKnight charges, maybe pouncing? Then Enemies go, and then Wiz O'Magic does his wizard stuff (Haste, Summon Monster).   It's the next round that Trixie uses her Wall Spells to start cutting enemies off from one another.  The other scenario is simple - Party runs across bridge, Trixie casts (Quicken Rodded, so she doesn't stop double moving) Programmed Image (rather than minor), and then runs like hell, letting it do its thing. At that point, the rules get fuzzy, but if I were a Horde of Low Level Orcs that the party doesn't feel arsed to fight, I'd be frightened of the big, honking dragon.",0,1398296313,Pathfinder_RPG,1,0

"* Kinect=Telescreen (Because the kinect is infamous for displaying government videos and such)  * Every single household has a connect (well except for the majority of the populous who doesn't own an Xbox kinect or even an Xbox)  * Record everything you do (again unless your the majority without a kinect *but fuck them right?*)  * Are you a problem? If so your sent to a *Secret prison or Guantanamo bay.* (Well besides the fact there are not secret prisons the fact is **there are hundreds of thousands of people who openly denounce the government every day**. If there were secret prisons for people who opposed the government the whole of Fox news would be there. Also GB is highly publicized (so are we sent to secret prisons of extremely infamous ones?) and it would be hard for the government to get a US citizen there without anyone noticing.  * Getting killed in a drone strike (well unless your in a heavily populated area even the US couldn't cover that up)  **So what we have learned**  **You would have to fit into this demographic for any of this to be even slightly feasible**  * Someone who owns a kinect (and actually uses it)  * Someone who speaks ill of the government   * Someone who lives in the middle of fucking nowhere (Drone strikes are messy!)  Well with all that logic I would narrow it down to: **Almost no one** so yeh basically even if half of the shit you spewed was true it couldn't happen.   &gt; Nice h8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8  &gt; Please get your news from somewhere other than /int/ next time",0,1399932624,worldnews,0,0

"Nice editing your comment so it's completely different. Was it because it showed how blatantly hypocritical you are? You sure are a funny and clever guy.   16 and 19 are two very very different ages. A person does a lot of growing and maturing in that time. Mind sets change and so do personalities. A 19 year old is considered an adult while a 15-16 year old is considered a teenager. The original question was asking if 15-16 year old *teenagers*  went out on coffee dates. It's a common thing for *adults* to go on coffee dates because a lot of *adults* drink coffee and enjoy a sit down date with other *adults*, where as a *teenager* may be a bit more awkward and unknowing, so a movie date would seem more appropriate for them.   So yes, you implied you were dating a 16 year old while you were an adult.   EDIT:   &gt;It must be hard for you to contain your rage.  g8 b8, m8 r8 8/8.",0,1400871430,socialskills,0,1

"Actually, since we have dual monitors we can play games and make reddit posts about muh grafecs *at the same time!*  Also, we still have way better graphics than you guys (and also other stuff like gameplay mods that add a bunch more stuff to the game) without graphic mods, unless it's CoD Ghosts. Also we play games as much as you console gamers, but at least we can rek skrubs without aim assist like you guys. Having cheap sales for games, without having to pay monthly fees? Check. Exclusives?

"Try:      dmesg|grep eth  and      lspci|grep Ethernet  to see the module and device (eg - r8169, Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411). You can post back or search them yourself to see if there have been any reported issues with it under linux.  I also recommend upgrading your kernel to the 3.13 Trusty backport since the stock eOS kernel is a bit old and doesn't do a good job supporting newer hardware. You can upgrade that with:      sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-trusty      sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  If you want to remove the new kernel, you can easily remove it by replacing 'install' with 'remove' in the same command.",0,1401243466,elementaryos,1,0

"I'm not sure if I can really add to this discussion since I've only been here for a weeks and haven't posted any videos ( though I am putting some effort into writing out story boards while my computer is getting fixed ). Anyways I agree with the OP, that the quality isn't always as good as it could be. Saying that there have been some really amazing videos posted here which has made me laugh and I've watched multiple times. These good videos IMO are the ones that are original and show me new stuff and don't reiterate the same  ten memes you see in every video. Keep in mind I've only been here a few weeks and already feel this way.   Anyways my suggestion is that we as a community (or maybe the few who are really good) make a sort of guidelines to making good montages that people can  fallow  to lessen the amount of bad videos. Also as individuals if you see a video that could be improved instead of down voting it and moving on, post some constructive feedback so that the dude or dudette knows what he is doing wrong. Posting in a mature manner will probably make him take you seriously as well. Almost everyday you see a video title  Dis is my first video  on the front page and every time people just post  gr8 video 8/8 m8  (yes I am a hypocrite) instead of giving real feedback, so that his next video will he better. Don't get me wrong I don't think we should throw away the culture we have and act all super serious, but I think if we want the community to grow in a positive way we will have to be serious some times.   I have rambled on way to long and since I just got of a 13 hour shift I'm not sure if any of it will be readable but whatever its just what I think.

"Ahh Melbourne.   A lot of people say that Tasmania is the turd of Australia. This is most likely true, which makes Victoria the anus.  Ignore what these penis-squeezing hippies say about Melbourne and Sydney, and live in a real state, like farking QUEENSLAND.  Anyways, moving forward:  Note 1: It's  STRAYA , not Australia (similiar to how MURICA is The United States Of fucking somecuntplace)  Note 2: AFL (Straylian Rules Football) is probably best described as  Aerial Ping Pong , the only game in the world where the players spend more time in the air than the ball does. It's a good game though, so you will be expected to pick a team and support them by the time you leave the airport/asylum seeker boat (depending on your preference of travel).  Note 3: Learn2bogan. You're new life will be undoubtedly easier if you learn how to live amongst the lowest common denominator. Spend some time in Frankston in a pair of tracky-daks (tracksuit pants), thongs (erm... thongs) and a flanno (flannelette shirt), hanging out the front of centre-link (place where you go to get dem sik hunnet fiddy dollar from da guvenment).  Note 4: Koalas are cute as fuck, until you hear their mating calls which kind of sounds like a Shark-Grizzly hybrid with a chainsaw for a mouth.  Note 5: Kangaroos are cute as fuck, until they disembowel you from a single kick.   Note 6: THEY'VE GOT FARKING FUNNEL WEB SPIDERS DOWN THERE, THE MOST CUNTIEST OF ALL CUNTY SPIDERS IN THE WORLD. FUCK THAT.  from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_funnel-web_spider :  *Early symptoms: goose bumps, sweating, tingling around the mouth and tongue, twitching (initially facial and intercostal), salivation, watery eyes, elevated heart rate and elevated blood pressure.  *As envenomation progresses: nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath (caused by airway obstruction), agitation, confusion, writhing, grimacing, muscle spasms, pulmonary oedema (of neurogenic or hypertensive origin), metabolic acidosis and extreme hypertension.  *The final stages of envenomation: dilation of the pupils (often fixed), uncontrolled generalised muscle twitching, unconsciousness, elevated intracranial pressure and death.  FUCK THAT. Move to Queensland m8, would r8 it 8/8",0,1402627201,Bravenewbies,1,0

"This is ridiculous and highly amateurish from Ming Thein who should know better. If a company, especially a high ranking one like Ricoh, uses your image without consent or pay you don't send an email and then furiously type a rant on the blog-section of your website 5 minutes later saying  THEY WON ANSWER MY EMAILS RAWRRR , you wait a day or two, call and send invoice. Doing this is of very bad character and is always dealt with behind closed doors, lawyer á lawyer. You don't drag a very high ranking company through the mud like this, great way of getting yourself blacklisted from their and their friends product **EVEN IF THEY ARE IN THE WRONG**.   * Email  * Call  * Invoice  * Lawyer up  Business is business, and this is how it is dealt with. BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. You don't air your or anyone elses dirty laundry online when you are dealing with any company of stature. The only time you might want to consider doing anything like this is if a company vehemently refuses to pay, which Ricoh wont &amp; can't, because they obviously used the image, and have to pay, plain and simple.   If you want to get payed for the photo, you are going backwards, especially dealing with Japanese companies, everybody knows how they are like, if you are looking to get alienated from Ricoh and allies but get site-clicks, you are doing a gr8 job m8, 8/8",0,1403033095,photography,36,0

We're not that big of a subreddit, there's no need to throttle the growth and creativity of the community by trying to categorize and split everything up into specialized subreddits. All that does is result in multiple dead subreddits instead of 1 healthy one.  Like, we all agree that low-effort content sucks dick. Requiring moderators to remove videos based on *obtuse and arbitrary specifications*, however, is a completely overboard solution for such a small problem.  If we were to start removing videos for the reasons I'm seeing listed in this thread. we'd have to remove at least half of the videos in our Top of All Time for this subreddit. That is just absurd.  tl;dr - no hitlerino plz, sub is gr8 8/8",0,1403117421,montageparodies,12,0

It is our belief (and actually it is reality too) that consoles are not better than PCs in ANY WAY. We understand the ownership of them (exclusives), we don't have alot against old-school consoles, because lets admit it, noone started with PC anyway (on his own at least). But newer generation, are just cheap pc repackage. If you have half a brain and like some hours of free time, you can figure pc gaming out its not rocket science.

"Summary:  I was Blue 1 FTL, which was very fun since we had a real nice command structure. Nick, our SL, did the strategy work and kept tabs on the teams, while we did the subtasks and general point-and-shooty stuff. Hapes and Remi did all the shooting really, I myself hadn't actually fired a bullet until after the push onto the radar station, which wasn't actually all that bad, since Red cleared that for us.   Reaching the AA station though, that was the scariest thing ever. When we got out of the civy cars and encamped ourself in a small shack up a hill, we were completely surrounded and many contacts started moving up on us. We were completely unaware until it was too late.   Hapes took a few bullets to his head and could finally be revived by Mailman after quite the surgery, under fire, mind you! When the enemy hordes finally closed in, we took so much heavy fire that I and hapes went down again. I managed to put a tourniquet on myself before passing out and that might actually have saved my life. When master medic Mailman was finished reanimating me after what felt like 10 minutes, we regrouped. Socks joined my FT and him, hapes and me pushed onto the compound.   We fragged a bunch of dudes and almost got blown to kingdom come by Calvin, who shot Drunk before the poor guy could take the survivor selfie with us. Dick move yo!  I still got 6 kills out of it at the end. I think I stole them all from hapes...  Issues:  * Remi and Pannekoek went DCWOL while moving in a convoy. That steam ticket shit is becoming a real pain. * Try to balance the action more (via the mission/high command). Blue didn't get much of a firefight until near the very end because Red(?) steamrolled everything in front of us.  Gr8 2 oper8 m8, will r8 8/8",0,1404688463,ProjectMilSim,5,0

It theorized that cats can adjust themselves torsionally to land on their feet, and hit terminal velocity (from free fall) after 5 stories, and the relaxed cat takes less damage.    -or-   Another possible explanation for this phenomenon would be the fact that **cats who die in falls are less likely to be brought to a veterinarian than injured cats**, and thus many of the **cats killed in falls from higher buildings are not reported in studies** of the subject.

"&gt;Destiny said on stream that he is paying each caster only $100 (QXC said he would do it for $200 so Destiny turned him down).  That's crazy, so he's only paying out like $600?? Where's the rest of the money going??  I did a bit of digging around, but I actually found some sick info buried [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/destiny-i/x/8049493). It's  a little obscure, but I managed to find it since it was the OP. I see that he even lists what the break down is for all of the money raised by the tournament, and he even specifies that extra money raised will also go towards another tournament. I think there's even a line in there that says that he'll do a full monetary analysis at the end to determine how much capital he was able to raise and where all of the money ends up going.  &gt;Destiny has a son to feed and he is definitely doing it for the profit, but reddit will still be riding his dick.  I definitely agree about this, it's pretty disgusting imo that some people today still seem to be stuck in this archaic thinking of  working for a profit . Tbh I think the charity model in e-sports where you lose money constantly works way more effectively, just look at IPL, NASL, and ESGN.  &gt;This event costs him literally nothing because we are doling out the funding for him and he keeps all the profit.  Considering that Destiny's time is worthless, this is also another great point. If he wasn't investing all of the time he has into organizing the tournament, I'm sure he'd just be falling asleep somewhere, missing another cast (lol!!!!!).  &gt;He pays nothing and risks nothing to build his resume and gain experience running a tournament.  I'm sure there is absolutely zero risk here. If the tournament is an absolute failure and is ran horrendously, I'm sure Destiny will suffer no ill-will and there will be absolutely no damage whatsoever to his reputation, especially since this is the first publicly-funded project he's launched.  &gt;TotalBiscuit on the other hand is operating deep in the red with Axiom eSports and is actually supporting the community at his own expense.  Hmm, this is a great point. I wonder if TB has disposable income from [some other business](https://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut) that he runs that might let him operate a team in SC2 at a financial loss. I wonder why Destiny doesn't just sink a bunch of his own money into the tournament.  &gt;We should thank ourselves for this event. Destiny deserves only a shred of the credit for putting this together and risking nothing.  Remember that meme with the basketball guy,  you da real MVP!  lol!!! I totally think it fits here. After all, before Destiny came along, this subreddit was regularly organizing $4000 prize pool tournaments with top caster and talented invited players almost on a daily basis, I think.

"DON'T skip the first two, hear the wind sing and pinball are really short and well written. They are a big part of the story in a wild sheep chase; they should've been on the same book like a wind up bird chronicle imo they make the story millions of times better and it's so cool to see how Murakami developed his style. He slowly starts adding that  magical realism  I love about him so much from hear the wind until it blows up on a wild sheep chase(one of the final scenes of the book gain  a lot of depth once you've read the first too). If you get the chance read what I talk about when I talk about running. It's a short memoir really nice and helps you understand his books better. As for dance dance dance it's not as interconnected as the first three books but I'm sure having read the rat trilogy allowed me to gain more depth and love the story of dance dance dance a lot more. Cheers, enjoy his books he's gr8 8/8.  E: I'm on mobile and too lazy to use caps, sorry! LOL",0,1405460134,books,3,0

"&gt;We have seen world wide protests in support of Palestinian and against Israeli war crimes committed in both Gaza and the West Bank. Protests in South Africa, across Europe, across Latin America, Australia, Canada were crazy in size, and this symbolic act shows that the world is getting tired of the occupation, colonization, and war crimes committed by Israel.  Yes, Muslims are wide spread its known. Their arabs leader such as erdogan or Assad likes to use Israel to pull hate of themelves.  &gt;Countries especially in Latin America were one of the most harsh on Israel's war crimes, such as Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Ecuador decided to cut ties with Israel, Chile dropping new trade talks, Brazil recalling their ambassador, etc.  They always do that before returning things back to normal. Venezuela was always an allay of Iran and hated Israel, so no surprise there.  &gt;On top of that, the Human Rights council just voted heavily against Israel. Out of the 29 country council, 17 abstained (which was essentially a vote against Israel), 1 was against, and the rest all voted to condemn Israel and in agreed that the UN should launch a probe which investigates the war crimes committed by Israel.  The UN Human Rights council is a rogue organisation within the UN itself which consists of countries such as Syria, Cuba, Iran and south Sudan. They form a block of countries to protect themselves and constantly try to blame Israel.  uman rights groups[who?] say the council is being controlled by some Middle East and African nations, supported by China, Russia and Cuba, which protect each other from criticism.[101] This drew criticism from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the ineffectiveness of the council, saying it had fallen short of its obligations. He urged countries to 'drop rhetoric' and rise above  partisan posturing and regional divides [102] and get on with defending people around the world.[101] This follows criticism since the council was set up, where Israel has been condemned on most occasions and other incidences in the world such as Darfur, Tibet, North Korea, and Zimbabwe have not been discussed at the council.[101] Ban Ki-Moon also appealed for the United States to fully join the council and play a more active role.[102] The UNHRC was criticized in 2009 for adopting a resolution submitted by Sri Lanka praising its conduct in Vanni that year, ignoring pleas for an international war crimes investigation.[103]    From the Wiki.  &gt;Although the UN and UN human rights council (and other UN-related organizations) usually do vote against Israel, this vote was very different. Many countries who are usually Pro-Israel or at least neutral, were against Israel in this vote. Some of those votes include Mexico, Russia, India and Philippines.  Ok Russia, the number 1 supporter of Israel, sure thing.  &gt;he world is sick of the occupation and colonization of land. It is sick of war crimes committed in Gaza. Before any of you try to defend Israel's actions by saying,  But Hamas fires rockets!!!,  let's actually talk about what happened.  Not really.  &gt;Hamas and Fatah announced a unity deal to strengthen the Palestinians. Days after, 3 Jewish settlers in the West Bank were killed, and Israel blamed this on Hamas. Hamas denied this, and a different organization took responsibility for it. Israel did not care, and started firing rockets down on Gaza, and broke the 2012 ceasefire by re-arresting the freed prisoners and continuing the Ariel attacks on Gaza. Israel has not shown any evidence to prove that it was Hamas that did the kidnap, but it decided to attack it in order to destroy the unity government.  The 3 Jewish kids were kidnapped by 2 people that belonged to the leading Hamas clan of the west Bank. Up until 2 weeks to the kidnapping they were spotted among Hamas. Israel of course believed it to be Hamas, because the kidnappers were Hamas members. (that gone rogue 2 weeks prior, sure lol). Israel arrested those people to try and crack information about their location, which of course only showed they gone rogue. So israel had no idea they rogue until they arrested them .  &gt;Hamas fought back, and continues to do so, by firing rockets into Israel.  After realising that they gone rogue. Israel told Hamas to stop fighting them. Hamas fired 200 rockets in 2 days. Israel once again said that peace will be answered with peace and that they are ready to give Hamas another chance. Hamas once again fired hunderds of rockets. And so Israel had to react.  &gt;2 civilians have been killed by those rockets, as opposed to the 700+ civilians killed by Israel.  Its a war started by Hamas. Israel take every step to ensure the survival of civilians, while Hamas put them in harms way.  &gt;srael continues to commit war crimes, and people across the world, in London, South Africa, France, Australia, Canada, Belgium, Netherlands, Russia, India, etc. continue speaking out, and Israel's diplomatic power continues to diminish.  Sorry, but there are no war crimes. Half of countries like South africa and Russia already hate Israel because its under the US and Russia support Syria. The rest all gave Israel a go for the operation and fully support it. So Israel diplomatic power still stands. Sorry m8 plz no 8 r8 8/8",0,1406329783,Israel,1,0

"&gt; you wanna call me a  peasant  for being financially stable  gr8 m8 8/8 worst troll ever.  you are financially irresponsible scum who probably has to worry more about climbing out of poverty than playing video games.  i've been there, friend, best advice is  prioritize .  video games are a luxury, but console manufacturers are counting on you believing it's a necessity.  &gt;go spend a thousand plus dollars on your new computer  as i said earlier, no financial foresight.  absolutely irresponsible, and a goldmine for console makers.  ignoring that you can *build* a xbone for less than an xbone costs, you can experience it without the limitations of $70 games or ridiculous OS restrictions.   if you *were* to invest (grown-up words here) a grand (one, maybe one and a half paychecks?) on a mid-high gaming rig, your  generational  upgrades would cost much less than an overpriced, OS restricted console.  $400 for an xbone with 2009 hardware?  you're a sucker, get the fuck out with your doritos and mountain dew.  4-5 year gpu upgrades are consistently $150-300, because PC leads the industry, consoles follow.  and that $300?  if you bought a $300 GPU *right now*, it would be on par with the xbox2 or whatever the fuck they decide to market it as, whatever test groups approve of.  that's literally where we're sitting at right now with consoles.  test groups.  like potato chips or flavored oatmeal.  &gt;more money into then I'll ever spend on every console purchase I will EVER MAKE before you replace it and start again in five years.  yeah right.  the three  new  call of duties released before your outdated-at-launch piece of shit is $20 at the flea market?  that's a GPU.  AND those three call of duties at discount prices.  those same prices that you'll never see on consoles.  you clearly don't know shit about pcgaming, but you need to know.  look, ask a friend, visit pcpartpicker, watch prices, and build a gaming machine.  YOU ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.  please   please ascend.  you are not mindless sheep.  you are better than this.  i believe in you, friend.  educate.  learn.  *then* decide whether you want to get ripped off or not.",0,1407188590,pics,2,0

"&gt;Great way of acting like a professional adult. Classic way of discussing with somebody. r8 8/8 m8 n b8 n w8  You stopped discussing and listening long ago. You started the insults and again.  &gt;I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals.  You are a fucking liar.  I have proven everything I have said.  I have shown polls from over 20 countries.  I have given examples out of the Koran.  You?  All you can say is no.  You give no sources. No polls. no citations.  So lets go through this one more time.  &gt;Again this shows how uneducated you are.  Giving sources and citations shows that I am educated.  Denying them shows you are a stupid lying fuck.  &gt;You are a fucking liar. very professional attitude.  You dont deserve professionalism.  &gt;ure dude. Just puts your fingers in your ears disregard everything I say and pretend you are so  educated .  You seem to be describing yourself here.  Again, citations, sources, polls, lists.  None of these show education but just saying NO does.  Fucking idiot.   &gt;not biased as shit. The dude removes the whole thing of there being a god and creating things. Great way of trying to contradict ways.  1000 contradictions.  You do not get to be the one who defines what a contradiction is.     &gt;Still a very professional attitude I see.  Again,  Fucking morons do not deserve professionalism.  &gt;500 million Muslims based on nothing I see great way to prove a point.  Based on scientific polls taken in every single country that has Muslims.   Science must be a weak point for fucking morons.  &gt;Honor killing isn't religious based.  Honor killing is infact religious based and over 90 percent of them are done by Muslims.  http://www.mailmagazine24.com/islam/03-2012/muslims-commit-91-percent-of-honor-killings-worldwide.html  &gt;In Islam you should not honor kill (But you already knew that because you are  educated )  In Islam you are commanded by Allah and the Prophet to infact honor kill. Read your Koran.  &gt;What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals. Sure dude there is this large conspiracy organization called the aluminiuminatie.(sic)  Get your spelling right.  You are a fucking moron.  &gt;reat way of acting like a professional adult.

"I used to work at a retail store unloading the trucks a 4am. The night before some friends came over and made a shit ton of weed butter. It was awesome, I put it in some Mac and cheese and had a nibble of a brownie and went to bed since I had to get up early. Well, it hits me while I'm sleeping and I feel WEIRD, but try and sleep through it. My alarm goes off and I can't believe it, I'm still high off my dong and my first thought is  im fucked, I can't do this.  But I do it anyway cause woo. I was sitting in my car, in the dark in the parking lot trying to mentally prepare myself; probably the highest I've been in my life. Then a friend I hadn't seen in maybe a month, more so a mutual friend at that point, knocks on my window and waves and smiles. I just WTF'd and tried to act normal, questioning reality. Turns out it was his first day.  I also remember working, and another coworker dancing or doing something stupid and I just start cracking up, unable to hold in the laughter and laughing way more than normal. He gave me an extra long look, he knew.   I was high for well over 8 hours, weed butter is a helluva drug. I r8 8/8 m8.",0,1407486435,AskReddit,2,0

"Thanks for posting it here, it's always fun to see first timers. I'll just throw some things out.  More background nice always helps. Not an overwhelming amount, but just enough to make the main parts of the song not feel too quiet or bland. A sweep up to the drop, some pads over the melody, etcetcetc.  The drums and main melody, synth thingy sound alright to me. The bass and the drop though, they could use some cleaning. Look around for some different bass sounds leading up to the drop of it. Something to put in with it would be fine too, like the synths at 1:10.  The drop just kinda sounds like some effects put onto a sub bass, not to sound harsh. Try to make it sound cleaner. Iunno what to suggest, really.  At 2:18. just play around with the kicks a bit so it sounds less overwhelming and more crisp. Distortion is fine, but hardstyle doesn't just mean loud.  Switch up the drums and other things a bit every once and a while. A fill into a different section, the synths getting more reverb-y going into the drop and then shifting back, things like that.  It's a good first, so good job on that end. I don't mean to come off as mean in criticizing, it's just things to think about if you're making more stuff. You don't always have to worry about pumping out a song if you're making something. Sometimes it's better to just play around with sounds and learn new tricks.  g8 m8 r8 8/8",0,1407694565,themonsterkittens,1,0

"The MF ult was only an example and what I mean was because her ult requires a small window of opportunity before it gets interrupted so she has to ult at the right time and versus a Yasuo means you have to play around with his C/D's. Adcs are not good duelists when versus someone like Fiora, Yasuo, Aatrox, Udyr, Yi, Irelia, Xin Zhao and teamfights don't really revolve around the ADC. I should say they revolve around the engager or a champion who is really strong in a teamfight like Orianna, Galio.  Thanks for the reply, m8 it was gr8, i r8 it 8/8",0,1408087830,leagueoflegends,3,0

I went as god tier Roxy, was only there for like 10 minutes, but I had so much fun! I really got into character and just had a good time.  AOTD1: At my best, I find that I'm like Roxy. I'm pretty casual and accessible a lot of the time, and *I* think I'm pretty fuckin cool, ya know? At my worst, I'm actually going to say Kanaya, just because I don't like asking for help, like, at all, and sometimes get too wrapped up in things I do't need to be.

"&gt;If they had half a brain they'd just choose atheism.  Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 str8 8/8  Edit for anybody who was seriously wondering and not being an edgemaster:   https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19%3A4-8&amp;version=KJV - what was linked in the above post (note that in the exact same thread the above poster linked, people refute the idea that homosexuality is even illegal by the religious laws of the bible and was instead only illegal by man-made laws, which essentially explodes the above poster's  hypocrisy in the church  argument)  http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-26.htm - Lot's wife looks back and dies, could also be seen as a punishment for Lot since he couldn't man up and control his wife. Makes you wonder if she was sleeping around too since he was apparently the woman in the relationship.  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19%3A4-8&amp;version=KJV - rape of Lot by his daughters (could be seen as punishment and further affirms his status as a beta bitch)  http://i.word.com/idictionary/christian -  one who professes belief in the teaching of Jesus Christ  , meaning a true Christian would believe only in the parts of the Bible which are claimed to be the direct words of Christ, not the historical books (the Old Testament for example, which is where Lot's story is found). They would also believe in the Gospels that were removed from the Bible by humans - for example the Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas, among others.  Final point - religion is a human construct anyway. If you're supporting atheism and regularly posting / lurking on /r/atheism like the above poster, then I assume you are an atheist. If you are an atheist, then I assume you believe that no deity actually gave people these rules and stories, they just made them up. So if people made up this religion, then the people who made it up are extreme, and the religion is just an extension of how extreme these people were.  So religion isn't nearly as extreme as people.",0,1409237511,4chan,1,0

"&gt; I asked you to say the sentence that makes me a  racists  [sic] to a black person. That's asking you to use it. I don't see how that's hard.  It's way beyond discussion that your racist comment was racist, kid. Your racist comment was deleted because it was racist. Keep up, kid.  &gt; Per your pedantic love   As per*. Kid, just stop trying to sound smart. You look like a complete fool  every time you try. :/  &gt; The fact it was deleted does nothing for your point, only mine. They took a string of words with no explicit racial meaning and deleted them.  Nope. Try again, kid. The fact that the racist doesn't consider them racist is a bit of a cliche at the point, kid. The fact that you were oblivious to how offensively racist your comment was is evidence to how you are actually racist yourself. Pathetic.  &gt; Because people perceive words differently. Which is how we started this whole mess.  This started because you can't understand English. Keep up, kid.  &gt; I provided a clear example of how words can be construed different than their meanings per some  standard English  which is  taught in primary school.  As such, your statement of there being  standard English  which has universal meaning falls flat. Hence your precarious position of insulting me rather than discussing the point.

You are so cringeworthy, kid.  &gt; I provided a clear example of how words can be construed different than their meanings per some  No, you didn't, sorry. :(  &gt; As such, your statement of there being  standard English  which has universal meaning falls flat.  Keep it up! One day you'll learn how to communicate!  &gt; Hence your precarious position of insulting me rather than discussing the point.  I'm insulting you because I'm not going to degrade myself by discussing something with a racist kid who think it's everyone else's problem that he can't understand English. You'll work it out one day, kid.  &gt;I also don't see why you have to feel like I'm a kiddo.   The fact that you blame everyone for your own lack of education, your racism, and indeed, your actual lack of education and basic ignorance leads me to believe you are a primary school kid. Either that or someone with mental issues, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt on that one, kid. ;)  &gt;Does it make you feel better to think you're beating up kids on the internet or something? That's a pretty sad existence, if so.  gr8 b8 m8 8/8  &gt;Last, for someone claiming I can't communicate, you sure as heck make a lot of grammatical mistakes. That must not be taught in primary school anymore.  Lastly*  Nah mate, it's just colloquial difference. a haha.

"Coke is fun. ketamine is fun. molly is fun. mushrooms are fun. Lsd is fun. Speed was weird but also fun... had a shitty low at the end of it.   I think most of them are pretty great so long as you respect the drug.  Cocaine, for me, was a great wake me up. But it made me want to talk(and I would, quickly) but id be worried the person I was talking to was getting bored of the conversation so id often half way through change the subject.  Lsd was strange for me, the first couple times it hit more on the emotions then I wound up taking a larger dose and started seeing halucinations. When I looked up at the sky I could see clouds look like they were breathing, the edges would push out like wavy tentacles then retract. I became one with the earth as the grass around my feet became one with me and I rooted myself into the ground. Everything I said was only semi coherent.  Low doses of ketamine made me feel drunk. Higher doses and I wound up walking like johnny depp in fear and loathing eg BIG STEP little step BIG STEP little step. Mind you I fucked up and mixed it with molly at the time.  MOLLY. Is a dance drug. Everything you do is fast and happy. My god I was happy to jusy dance.   Mushrooms I wound up laying in boiling hot tent at shambhala for 2 hours with a couple friends while laughing at nothing in particular.  The speed was an accident as far as I can tell it was supposed to be m. Wound up feeling anxious at a club for several hours. At one point I grabbed my friends shirt jokingly when this girl came up and tried to break up our  fight  she though we were having.  I started yelling at her  hes my husband! Hes my husband dammit!  And she walked away completely confused(im 6'5  pretty big guy)  I felt like 10 piles of shit in a sweaty bunk bed the next morning.  All in all i'd r8 most of 'em 8/8",0,1409804424,AskReddit,2,0

"&gt; Pirelli SuperCorsa SP, BridgeStone BT-003, DUNLOP GP-A Pro, Michelin Power Supersport etc. In other words, the most aggressive tires that are not full-slicks.   Honestly, these are not a good idea for you. Most of these tires are full on trackday tires, they aren't made to warm up as quickly as a street tire. They are designed for use with warmers, and if you don't use warmers they take longer than a street tire to come up to temp.   Plus, if you're asking about tires, it's likely that you *are not fast enough* to work one of these tires hard enough to really use it.   It's not as simple as  softer is more grippy but wears faster . Yes, that's an aspect, but that's ignoring warm up time, carcass support, stability vs agility, etc, etc.    I'd get Dunlop Q3's, Michelin Pilot Power 3's, or Pirelli Supercorsa SP's. [Here's me running a low advanced pace on Dunlop Q3's on a 1043cc bike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evnWm1mZdE0) At :23 you can see the rear tire squirming under acceleration and then lifting the front a little. If anyone is riding this fast on the street, they are either a moron or have some mental issues.    Q3's have more grip than you'll ever need. They warm up fast(1 lap on the track, or a couple of minutes on the street), grip extremely well, and talk decently well for a street tire.     [When they slide, they usually catch pretty quickly, even in 30 degree weather.](http://youtu.be/k3UqLA_yMuE) Granted, you aren't going to be riding in those kinds of temps, but you can see the tire still has grip even when literally ice cold.    For someone who doesn't ride at the track with full pace, that's important. You don't want to be that guy who buys a race slick thinking it'll give him grip, floors it out of his driveway, and ends up with his shiny Panigale in bits.   And considering you just [jumped to a 2004 R1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Yamaha/comments/2du5ex/literally_100_stock_pristine_2004_yamaha_r1_red/) after only having ridden a 125 for a year and then a [burgman for 2 years](http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/263rmv/jump_straight_to_liter_bike/) I'm 100% confident that you would be wasting your money on track tires and would likely not realize all the caveats to a track focused tire.    So, TL;DR get the Q3's m8, th'r gr8 i r8 8/8",0,1410104771,motorcycles,2,0

"And the more news friendly their video is, the more American citizens who will see it first hand. Their message isn't one designed to draw American citizen's sympathy but to enrage Americans. Their demands are not reasonable or of humanitarian nature, it is only inflammatory and leaves no room for even the most neutral americans to say,  Oh, I see what they mean now, maybe we should make a deal.   They already have the reputation of brutality, so showing it in the video will just take away viewers without adding anything to general opinion of their movement. They want people to be pissed, because when a majority of people feel threatened or injured they know our politicians will be much more likely to put American boots on the ground.  So to ISIS we should all be saying,  Gr8 b8, m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8. I r8 this b8 an 8/8. Plz no h8, I'm str8 ir8. Cre8 more, can't w8.

In the end, we must learn to take the deaths of those journalists as the common murders that they are. These journalists, who are (imo) generally noble, are taking well known risks by being out there. They are critical to our world of limitless information but their safety is an entirely separate issue than a millennia-old religious war being hijacked by a petty political land grab.  TL;DR: ISIS is a shitposting newfag trying to get a rouse with Shovel Dog and we oldfags need to tell them to lurk moar and keep on with our business.",0,1410150221,worldnews,107,0

"&gt;An anecdote. First time I died in Null, when I had no idea what to expect, my barely fitted Imicus (didn't have cloak &gt;yet, had not mods for doing anything) was tackled and hit by a whole gang from E-Uni and then podded. I understood &gt;the gank but not the pod and asked some of the guys who got me about it and how I died. I was told I didn't do basic &gt;things to survive, that it was clear I was a noob, that I was podded because  EvE!  and that they did it because no &gt;one else had come through the gate in hours and they were bored.  One of the biggest misconceptions of this game, especially among new players, is that people specifically target them **all of the time**. While specific entities may target new players because they are unaware of mechanics (this is especially true of some hisec groups), in the situation you described, it could have been literally *anyone in the game*, and they would have killed them. It is very atypical to actually see how old a player is before blowing them up if given the opportunity to do so.      I'd also like to address the following:  &gt;Many are now ready to respond with things like  suck it   good riddance ,  you don't get EvE ,  go back to WoW!  etc. &gt;etc. but that is part of the point... yes it is a sandbox, but if you keep treating newbros like $hit until they learn the &gt;rules and that they have to both deal with and dish out tons of $hit, then you will continue to have trouble retaining &gt;newbros. The environment feels pretty toxic.    The use of the word toxic here is fairly asinine. There *is* a lot of harsh criticism in Eve, because the competitive nature of the environment demands a certain level of competency in a lot of situations. Learning to take that criticism in a constructive way, instead of weeping endlessly about the forums about how the community is  mean  or  hurting your feelings  is one of the major aspects of this sandbox - nobody here is going to hold your hand, and every single entity in the game down to the most new player friendly corporation expects some self sufficiency and actual motivation. This isn't a game that will  make you like it . It's a game that you come to understand and appreciate through experiencing the great things that happen with the community and with the other players.      tl;dr gr8 b8 m8 8/8",0,1410207791,Eve,1,0

"*&gt;*[I don't have the convenience to play all day, everyday.](http://puu.sh/bM5Lt/e9b85f6db5.png)  Nice meme m8 i r8 8/8 no h8. PS: Don't use  Solo queue toxicity  as a defense for getting called out wtf rofl. And then you *literally SHOW* Solo queue toxicity at 3:50 by going on a rengar blame game for getting caught ***AGAIN***. * I don't know why rengar didnt do anything when i decided to engage... *  **Nooooo she engaged on you and solo'd you out. Repeat, you DIDN'T engage; you got CAUGHT.**  What you should be saying is  *I don't know why i didn't respect riven's early levels*[***WITH IGNITE***]*and get caught out*  and  *Why didn't I e and flash away from xin into the brush instead of trying to act like a sick cunt and e'ing on riven into the MIDDLE of the lane*    It may have been true rengar could have followed but riven did not use flash to kill you and Xin wasn't shown on the map yet. So at best he would have gotten a kill while Xin cleaned up + Riven assist putting you further behind.  Like Jesus christ that was played poorly. But what i love the most is that you only won this game *Because* of the rengar. Solo queue success comes from realizing your own mistakes, not continuously pointing out others while paying a blind eye to yourself, that might be one of the reasons you're still struggling with 1000+ games in the lower elo.  Also although that guy is a dick; he has a point. Set your standards a little lower, at most  Road to Plat . Otherwise you will have no followers interested because they would think you're a self entitled prick. It's not like you're Gold 4 with 10 wins, who shows promise to climb. Be a little more humble and people will flock [*if you're entertaining*].",0,1411575256,leagueoflegends,2,0

It'd look great on you, and I can see a short haircut looking pretty damn good on you too.",0,1411604853,amiugly,3,0

"Bon, je vais faire un commentaire aussi équilibré et calme que possible, parce que c'est un sujet auquel je tiens vraiment et je sais que certains de mes copains sur ce sub aussi (des deux côtés du débat) et que ça va s'énerver.  &gt; Photo de Femen en en-tête  Déjà, Femen =/= féminisme. Le groupe a bougé idéologiquement, surtout depuis qu'on a offert l'asile à cette sociopathe de Shevchenko. Maintenant, Femen est au féminisme ce qu'Action Directe est à la gauche: des radicaux qui mixent toutes les idéologies qui trouvent et font du terrorisme au nom du  progrès .  &gt; Comme vous avez pu entendre, cette conne de Kelly Brook avoue publiquement avoir violenter deux de ses anciens petits amis et celle-ci, avec l’animateur, osent en rire…   C'est un vrai problème. La plupart des féministes te diront que c'est la faute du système moderne qu'ils appellent Patriarchie et qui fixe des règles genrées pour les hommes comme pour les femmes, et que même si les hommes sont généralement dominants dans le système, ils souffrent particulièrement de la règle interdisant aux hommes de souffrir ou de montrer de l'émotion sous peine d'être traités de lopettes.  Je ne suis pas d'accord avec cette analyse, tout d'abord parce que je ne suis pas d'accord avec l'analyse de la Patriarchie et ensuite parce que la plupart des groupes féministes qu'il m'a été donné de lire affichent un mépris étonnant pour les problèmes des hommes. Leurs réactions se découpent en deux:  Lol what about the men  et  On s'occupe d'abord des femmes, les problèmes des hommes se résoudront après!  (Par magie?)  &gt; problème avec le fait d’avoir associés majoritairement ces valeurs à la femme par ces groupes, c’est le monté aux barricades contre les hommes. Jamais on entend dire  »Une lesbienne n’a pas respecté le corps de la femme » ou bien  »Une fille n’a pas respecté le corps de l’homme », le seul et unique discours qu’on entend est celui-ci :  »L’homme n’a pas respecté le corps de la femme ».   ...Si en fait, on l'entend. Les stats commencent à sortir, il y a autant sinon plus de violences conjugales parmi les couples gays (tous genres confondus) que parmi les couples hétéros (aux US, en tout cas). On en parle, des groupes comme les Canadiens de CAFE sortent du bois. Les groupes féministes sont peut-être pas le fer de lance du débat autour des problèmes des hommes, mais *ils n'ont pas à l'être*. Si vous voulez participer à une cause pareille, rejoignez des groupes MRAs ou *egalitarians*, n'attendez pas que les féminites le fassent pour vous.  &gt; féminisme extrémiste   &gt; vagins sableux   &gt; mentalité à victimiser la femme et culpabiliser l’homme   &gt; Mange de la marde féminisme, retourne à tes racines et cesse ton putain d’égoïsme.  C'est clair qu'avec un débat apaisé et factuel comme ça, on va grave avoir l'occasion de faire avancer le schmilblick. /s  En conclusion: J'ai écrit ces lignes pour rien, cet article est un troll.

"I browse this because it's interesting to read - the server is political regardless of how you spin in even though there isn't random discussion about ideologies you'll never see in the real world anymore. Just because I don't feel like arguing about something I feel you're looking far to into doesn't mean I shouldn't be browsing this subreddit.   The difference between what i'm saying and what you are saying is i'm giving out a basic interpretation of whatever America wants to do and you're delving into political theory about whether or not something is legitimate based off of morality/force/whatever to come to a conclusion.   Regardless of whether people feel it's  right  or  wrong  - they are going to do what they want to do anyways. Technically, there is no predetermined right or wrong, so what you are saying about 'might is right'(I don't even know why you started arguing that point) I guess is correct but it doesn't matter. America is going to do what it wants to do, and whatever their 'right' may be will be backed up by whatever amount of might they decide to bring to the table.

They cared too much about other stuff while I spent most of my days practice shooting a bow with my father, after we practiced, he would tell me to go inside and get something to eat while he was away doing something, sometimes he would never return until 6 in the evening, i ask of him  father, where did you go? ,  I went to the local bars, theres nothin to worry about , sometimes he would have a few bruises, but I didn't bother asking him about his bruises. One late night, he didn't return home, I asked the villagers if they have seen my father somewhere, but they all answered the same thing,  No  . I was depressed. I stayed at home every day just thinking about where my father could be. Some say he died the same way my mother died, others say he got killed by black bear, I grew tired of these crazy old tales and carried on with my life, maybe one day I'll find him, but until that day comes, I'll just keep on fighting! (Epic Music starts) I r8 this story an 8/8. wut du u tink m8?",0,1413354454,dwarvendistrict,3,0

"&gt;Why did you link me to authors repeating what I've claimed here?   There are some suggestions that the sociological definition of racism can be adjusted but most included some element of **societal power**   Le racisme primaire* ou «autrisme», fondement supposé de Г« hétérophobie » 4, encore dénommé « panekhthrisme » 5 — du grec ekhthros «ennemi» — , désignerait un phénomène psycho-social très général et peut-être une réaction universelle: le sentiment de méfiance envers tout «étranger», la perception «spontanée» de l'Autre inconnu comme ennemi, déclenchant fuite ou agression6.    Seriously? &gt;I proved that they follow very similar ideas, like the rejection of most sociological concepts that are accepted by sociologists across the world.  No, you didn't. You also proved me that you didn't understand my links because they state that the topic is complex and it can't be oversimplify.   &gt;Ah, so equivocation is your tool here. Doesn't really help you though as at no point have I claimed that it's non-controversial amongst laymen, that was your argument.  You say non-controversial, period. You didn't give more information. BTW you decided to use this example.  &gt;...You defend your non-sequitur with more non-sequiturs?  Haha, gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8.",0,1413939995,TheBluePill,2,0

"&gt; Seriously?  Yes seriously. I'll assume that English isn't your first language as that will explain why you're apparently having so much difficulty correctly reading my posts and I'll help you out. The word  most  is not an absolute term.   More importantly, Taguieff is one of the main members of a neoconservative think-tank, and a philosopher not a sociologist, so his support of things like Islamophobia shape his description of racism.  So I don't see how: a) he's relevant to a discussion on sociology, and b) why we should consider him a relevant expert.  &gt;No, you didn't.  I clearly did since you had no argument against me.  &gt;You also proved me that you didn't understand my links because they state that the topic is complex and it can't be oversimplify.  Since I've never denied that the issue is complex, and I have even explicitly discussed the nuances of the topic, this accusation is a little ridiculous. It's becoming apparent that you've accepted that the only way you can come out on top here is to assign positions to me that I have explicitly rejected as being ridiculous, and then claim that those positions are ridiculous therefore I'm wrong.  How about a change in pace: why not try challenging things I've actually said?  &gt;You say non-controversial, period. You didn't give more information. BTW you decided to use this example.  I used  non-controversial  in the context of the discussion on how TiA challenges or rejects standard scientific concepts when it suits them so the only reasonable conclusion is that they are not controversial in science. Which is how you interpreted it given that your defence was that American sociology differs from the rest of the world and so attempted to show  controversy  there.  If you are interpreting  non-controversial  as  nobody argues against it  then you're just defining yourself as tautologically correct, as the whole discussion started from the premise that TiA disagreed with the concept. By your reasoning, the fact that TiA disagree with these concepts means that they are controversial!  &gt;Haha, gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8.  I can respect that.

"Gr8 B8 M8, I give 8/8.  Are you being serious? Microsoft is just as dedicated as Apple to cut out as many middle-men as possible who can disrupt their ecosystem. This fitness band is nothing special. It's more interesting to see a company such as Razer, who have knowledge in peripherals and large devices, to take the same finish to a wearable.   It's true that there aren't many apps yet for Nabu, but that's why Razer Insider was set up - to get developers into the ecosystem and develop apps for both iOS and Android. They might not have the polish of Microsoft, but they can deliver a shine to products that large companies, such as Cooler Master or BitFenix, struggle to achieve.  If you're trying to tell me that the launches and transitions from Windows XP through to Windows 8.1 was smooth and that the planning for the operating system went well is a joke. Consistency of design all the way through even to Windows 10 is abysmal - I've seen tiny Linux distros look better with consistency, and it isn't down to Legacy vs Non-Legacy, either.",0,1414708333,razer,-1,0

"&gt;gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8.  But for other people reading who might be confused in a more honest way, there is a difference between a mostly unedited 20-25 minute solid interview with no real desire on the producer's part except to hear some interesting voices, and a highly edited 25-minute-down-to-3-minute interview with a real desire on the producer's part to make it as comedic and laugh-worthy as possible.  That said, it isn't that no one should go on, it's that we'd need a comedian. Someone who can be funny while getting our points across and just mundanely unfunny (not incredibly or it becomes an anti-joke) if it's about side topics that are uninteresting. That way they would use positive footage, because comedy &gt; both facts and agenda for these programs.   So it is possible, it just isn't advised for the, frankly for the most part unprepared and unpracticed members of the revolt to participate.  EDIT: I watch the Daily Show a lot. There are people who have come out  successful  in the middle-segment short interviews, but without exception they're very funny people who joke about the cause and laugh, but still get their message out.",0,1414900768,KotakuInAction,2,0

"View from Sobol 1's commander.  **Mission Difficulty**  Overall not too bad, don't know how it was from the infantry's perspective but I felt in terms of threats to the BMP's there was actually fairly little I was concerned about, would like to see some armored threats put up against us next time maybe, nothing too overkill but at least something a bit more involved than just the odd technical or two. Having something for the armor to concern themselves with whilst the infantry does their thing of shooting mans might help with the long stints of 'nothing' I felt when waiting for them to secure a town, the separation of infantry and armor at the last assault helped alleviate that problem greatly however, so it might just be up to how the commander handles the situation given to him. We might just need to run the mission another time to see how it's different with another commander.  **Equipment**  Was commanding in a BMP2, had vectors for some reason as well as a 148 and a 117F, ditched the 148 on the LCS as it was just superfluous for the comsig that had been set up, if armor had had their own net on the 148 I might have kept it, but everything was on channel 1 so yeah. Lack of magnified optics kinda bugged me as a commander, I don't get why BIS won't let me use binos when turned out, maybe something we can mod/script in.  **Leadership**  Overall seemed okay, I did notice a bit of confusion at times with the comms and were people were supposed to be, especially in the beginning, most of it was handled well though  I can neither confirm nor deny that at this time  became a bit of a joke within the vehicle. As the mission progressed comms slowly tightened up a bit but what I did notice was a general lack of confirmation to things from Sobol 2 and the fact command seemed to forget we were there at times so I elected to stick with Anna as best as I could whilst trying not to shoot too many mans.  **Mission Timeline**  Spawned on the LCS, mass confusion about where the vehicles were at first, took too long to disembark the LCS in the beginning but I think there were some technical issues delaying us, figured out my driver couldn't turn out anymore but that was sorted by using compass bearing orients and then referencing the landmarks he could see with his limited FOV.  Trudged our way through the water, got shot at, shot back, took out a BRDM which was nice, made landfall and dumped our load. Took some time for the squads to get organized and assaulted the first town. Stayed mostly back, gave fire where we thought needed and then hung around whilst people were discussing whether or not the docks had been cleared for about 15 minutes and mans went to look for a sniper with a suppressed rifle.  Eventually moved further towards our main objective, no further resistance encountered so we loaded up again and trudged down the road singing our merry tunes of the motherland and made a  you see Ivan...  joke here and there.  Dumped our load again at another town and supported troop movement once again, witnessed 3/4 of Anna get mowed down by something and rushed forwards past the wounded to try and provide cover and a bigger target for mans to shoot at, eventually got everyone back up and cleared the town before people mounted up again.  Moved further onto the road, took some fire before the final objective but ditched our mans again and proceeded to hold briefly before assaulting along side Sobol 2, moved into an entrenched position behind some friendly and helpful sewage pipes and a barricade that I guess was supposed to stop us but instead got turned into BMP cover as our mans assaulted the town whilst we tried to murder what was trying to murder them, Sobol 2 got taken out by a technical, we got revenge, then silence.  Suddenly hear an engine behind us, and see a flash of a white SUV/Truck door through the trees, get the BMP turned around and into cover on the other end of the sewage pipes and took out a small squad and 3 technicals that were trying to counterattack and instead got on the wrong end of a 30mm cannon. Good times were had by russians, not so much the rebels.  Got shot at by someone on our side who couldn't aim, almost lit up Iron as he came driving in in a technical. Then we moved up to the RP and mission was called after singing glorious soviet national anthem next to the BMP.  **Overall**  Had fun, would like to see some more threats to the armor, ride script got sorted out (dammit Faaaaaaaxxxx!), had plenty of mans to shoot, no zoom to see them with and I think I managed to restrain my bump a bit. Good times. i r8 8/8",0,1414999344,ClearBackblast,2,0

"Broadsword: nerfed.  GS: still gr8 m8 it's 8/8.  Brandi: still powerful despite the nerf.  Messer: not necessarily the best Knight weapon, but definitely pretty powerful. Although it is more common to see knights with mauls than knights with messers.  Archers are still completely OP'd with any ranged weapon. But 4 weapons excel with the ranged class:  Warbow: don't use broadhead arrows, though. They're completely useless with Xbow now.  Heavy Crossbow: you can 1-shot Knights and Vanguards at full health with a headshot. MAAs and Archers die with 1 shot at any part of the body.  Crossbow: the designated anti-archers weapon for marksmen since Xbow was nerfed. A well all-rounded weapon.  Heavy Javelins: the most annoying and powerful weapon for archers. You can just run&amp;shoot while delivering insane amounts of damage. On top of that, you get a buckler and they're good for melee combat.",0,1415119458,ChivalryGame,3,0

"It's not a question of not liking  1st: Most of this subreddit say that ocelote is still toxic  2nd: You shouldn't say  i make everyone's life better by being with them , you have a god complex/messiah complex, which shows that you cannot see that you are wrong.  Parallel here.  Hitler believed he was right, look at what happened (of course the extent of Hitler's responsability can be discussed, but that is not the question).  Ocelote is just saying, i am always right and you are wrong. I don't give a fuck because i am always right (god complex).  3rd: Ocelote offended LS, racially and homophobically, and that is not something you should do in public(even in private that is not something you should do either).  4th: I don't expect you to change your mind, but if you want to, i repeat, IF YOU WANT TO, try to analyse this case without choosing any side, analyse this independently.  5th: I repeat, if you think Sky was trying to make Ocelote look bad, you have a good understandment of english and you are clearly right and everyone else is wrong.

"SasuSaku is degrading and disgusting.   What should have been a tale of Sakura learning that the feelings she had for Sasuke was just a childhood crush and realizing that all of the shit he put her through was nothing short of abusive, allowing her to move on to someone actually worth it, turned into... this.  I guess I don't know why I give a shit so much, but it's obnoxious and I honestly didn't think it would happen. What so, 698 chapters of abuse, and he gets redeemed in the last two as a good guy who suddenly has feelings for her?

"Picture this.  A strangely hot day in regularly cold and wet South Wales, I just about win my last game at 89 lp to get into Gold promos, I've never been this close before in my life, panic ensues.  I queue up, lock in Leona (my main) and all is well, no problems so far, game goes well and me and my team obliterate our enemies forcing them to surrender.  The adrenaline is pumping through my body so I queue up again, this time I'm 5th pick and Morgana isn't banned somehow, manage to lock her in and the game starts. Game goes awfully and everyone on my team feeds (including myself, sucks right?)  I think to myself  Okay, it's quite late, I should sleep, nah bun that lets go again   You know the deal, get put into ADC. An unfamiliar role but hey, Gold is at the stake with a week to go before season ends, what do I have to lose? Lock in Jinx against Lucian, leggo. Lane goes perfectly and I get almost every CS that comes my way, end lane phase 4-0 (their support wasn't the best) Rest of the game goes okay so we win after about 5 teamfights and a baron steal from our godly jungler.  Now I think to myself  Yeah.. It's late and I'm literally sweating, time to sleep.  Dreams filled with game scenarios, yeah I know how sad that is, but I want Gold so it's cool, right? Right.  Morning comes, go into the day with a clean head and my mind set on one thing, Gold.  Eat breakfast, shower, change into comfy clothes, sit down at desk, headset on, open League... It's time.  Queue up, lock in Leona. Game is a HUGE struggle, almost 1 hour long after numerous teamfights, my team loses about 75% of them but our Yi backdoors at 56 minutes to get us the win. At this point I'm shaking and sweating more than I ever have before (in a game of League atleast)  Queue up again, lock in Leona... Game was.. Extremely difficult. Mid lane gives first blood, top dies 5 times in Lane and our Jungler refuses to gank  until he gets feral flare    The most stale and passive bot lane ever, their Blitz blindly throws out pulls and I keep river warded for ganks, Caitlyn and Jinx exchange auto attacks but, nothing exciting.  About 50 minutes into the game I spot their Nocturne trying to come up behind us while teamfights form at mid lane, I instantly call him out and get my team to role all over his face, then the enemy team force a fight. Bad mistake for them.  I ult 3 people, pop locket on all my team mates and go in simply shoving myself to their back line and locking up Jinx, never let her out of my sight and keep beating her into a pulp. Behind me the 3v4 teamfight is barely happening, Caitlyn keeps poking and poking away but to no avail, I get jinx go about half health and ping her like crazy, Caitlyn locks in her ult and BOOM, Jinx dies.  Get myself right back into the teamfight and continue to be as obnoxious as possible, the glorious word  Ace  gets played into my headphones. Only Caitlyn and I are left on the rift.  We push down mid, get all nexus defenses and finish the game. Best games of my life.  Edit: tl;dr gr8 games m8 couldnt concentr8 but i r8 8/8",0,1415616193,leagueoflegends,1,0

"&gt;Excuse me? I'm shoving my mindset onto others? I AM shoving it??? If there’s any “shoving” going on, it’s from stupid internet teenagers and overly-tolerant companies such as 2k or Bioware, down the throats of normal people who may be indifferent, or may be, like me, highly intolerant of gays.  Wonderful. You admit you're highly tolerant of gay people, but yet that doesn't stop you from projecting your feelings upon everyone else and assuming everyone feels the same. They are being inclusive, tolerant and just plain ol' nice. I don't know why that gets under your skin, though.  &gt;“No one bats an eye at the quest where you have to listen to Roland and Lilith flirting” -- Yeeeah might be because they're normal people? And it’s normal for male and female to flirt around??  It's normal for *people* to flirt, and the gender shouldn't matter. I'm not saying they should remove that -- it establishes certain characteristics of Lilith and Roland (awkwardness, off the top of my head) -- no, I'm just saying no one gave a fuck, yet Jainey and Athena... well here we are now.  &gt;Gays are by FAR a minority. What’s their overall numbers compared to normal people? 5%? 7% of population?  Sauce, bra? I know we're a minority, but dat percentage doe.  &gt;And you dare to demand so much attention and acceptance? No. A bit of attention maybe, alright.    So much ? We would like acceptance, we'd like marriage, we'd like people to not fear getting their ass beaten up for holding hands. With all the things that have happened, I'd say giving us that isn't *so much to ask*.   &gt;One-two not-too-important npc would've been enough. NOT 40% of all characters, including playable.   Sauce for that? Also, who gives a flying fuck about sexuality! The game is just that. A game. You are making a big fuss about it, when their sexuality won't determine class balance, skills, etc. If you are repulsed by simply playing an LGBT character, then by GabeN you are fucking intolerant.  &gt;Seriously, what a totally fucked up worlds people of Borderlands and Dragon Age live in where every third one (at least) is gay?   gr8 grammer m8, i r8 8/8.  Dude, sauce. The basis of your argument is simply the number of people, yet you don't bother to give accurate numbers. You're exaggerating everything to get your point across.  &gt;And worst of all they fucking have to mention it all the time! Hammerlock couldn’t avoid using the word “boyfriend”. That Rosie npc couldn’t just not mention that her “ex” is also a “her”. Dialogue between Tina and Athena about Springs couldn’t be left out for whatever reason. They HAVE to PUSH, or using your own words, SHOVE their sexuality down player’s throats.  They are mentioning something about themselves, a relationship between two people. How would 'Lock know some guy was missing? It builds character, dude. The Rosie thing was out of place, I'd say, but maybe it's just to show how precocious she was about all that. She mentioned Gabby not being able to handle it, and herself editing  several political letters . Tina and Athena... well would you be complaining if it was a straight person? I've drawn parallels between Scooter and Jainey before. Scooter is even creepier in his methods of wooing ladies, not even quitting when one moved *to a fucking wasteland* to get away from him. Jainey was very coy about telling us  they  killed her girlfriend.  &gt;“No one gives a fuck about sexuality” that’s what you want to think. Gays were despised, are despised now and will always be despised and laughed at by great many people.  Many is not all nor is it none. As long as there are ***good*** people supporting, then it shouldn't matter how many give a flying fuck.  &gt;It’s a vocal internet minority that creates an illusion of tolerance.  Oh, and anti-gay people are abounds and quiet, with you as the sole voice for a people under threat? Dude, how can you be sure of any of that?  &gt;I have many friends who also post pro-gay shit online and say that they're “perfectly fine” with someone’s sexuality. But when pressed on the matter by me, they cracked that they actually don’t like gays and wouldn’t want to ever see one and definitely wouldn’t want to have any contact with them.  ... secondary idea: they didn't want to get into a fight with a bigoted idiot and just nodded and smiled to get the fuck out of whatever zone the pair of you were currently occupying.   - **OR**  You are talking out of your rectum, through your anus and over the ass cheeks.   &gt;Also, surely mods deleting anti-gay posts and banning people for it, practically forcing people who dislike gays to be quiet, has nothing to do with it either, right?  Got some barbecue **source** for that hefty plate of accusation and assumption?  &gt;Go play an mmo where such rules are not enforced on people and listen to how much tolerant people are and count how often someone’s called a “fag”. You think they using that word out of tolerance and it’s actually a praise? Heh…  People say vulgar things online. I can't condone that, but I can't condemn it. I will insult others on a particularly bad day. Sure, they use the word fag, but that's only one of many words they use. I also like how you assume I think that's them being tolerant.  &gt;Keep living your illusion, knowing that every time you sit in cafe with your “boyfriend”, there’s someone looking at you with disgust.  I don't have a boyfriend, sadly. Thank you for thinking that a fellow like me could get someone!  &gt;Anyway… I've made my point  Have you? You've just said a bunch of crap. Words =/= making a point.  &gt;don’t bother with your angry answers  Okay, I'll just be nice, like you! Also, nice, you say you've made your point with an argument that falls to more pieces than a brisket, then you deny any further discussing.  &gt;And oh yes, they will, trust me they will…. Keep your closet ready… You're moving back soon.  Parting words that have left me thinking. My closet's full, though. Got jumpers, a courier bag, Family Guy board game and a battleship model in there. Sorry, that's simply too small with too much shit in it.",0,1415789571,Borderlands,1,0

"Alright girl expert here, I'm gay by the way so this comment has no prior bias.  First off you have to realize that girls are indeed people too, but not like men people, men are MUCH more fun and approachable and much less mean all around. So actually women are nothing like people that you are used to, mostly men. Thats ok tho because im going to teach you ow to be with women.   If you want to approach a women, just think like you're approaching a dude. But forget how you would normally approach a dude because you're not approaching a hot, sexy, handsome, cute, TONED, adorable, FLOWING HAIR, ripped male. You are approaching a female who you have no prior experience with. So try and be calm.   Women will always go for people who are very attractive over the people who are ass ugly. If you're ugly im sorry you're probably not gonna have a good time. However some women like comedy and others do not. So try and be funny at first but if she doesnt take it just try and be boring as well. If she takes the b8 m8 r8 8/8 meme then she will probably start talking to you. And as chip$ says in the song Detroit 187 by Danny Brown  If she makes eye contact then the bitch'll fuck  and I'm guessing that is what you're going for in the first place.  However the STD rate for hetreosexal couples are MUCH higher than homosexual couples (cite needed xD) its just a lot smarter to FDB )fuckthat bithc( and then try being gay. I dont think i was born gay but i sure changed into one, might be something my parents did with the whole abuse and stuff (i will reply more about this if someone asks, but i dont want to get too personal).  So overall, just try and be yourself and she probably wont like you or maybe she will and have sex.   EDIT: thanks for the gold sind kranger :33",0,1415843035,teenagers,0,0

Most of the bands people are mentioning are held up as pretty average or generic to anyone deeper into the genre (because we've heard all of the bands they're copying) but are beloved by people who aren't- so we're going to mention them.   Every time a thread like this hits the front page, though, people get butthurt that their favorite bands that we don't like are being panned and then they downvote everything to shit. It's rude to come to a sub you don't normally visit and stomp all over it and kill any discussion that's not praising the most popular ten bands in the genre.",0,1417049090,Metal,3,0

"So we're talking about fixing the game because of an exploit. You say the devs won't listen. I say that you can tell a mod (like me), and i'll notify Gus about it. So they can fix if possible. Now you're just talking about how mods are notorious for using exploits for our own good.   If we FRIKEN withheld info on an exploit from Gusmanak. He would FRIKEN rip us new one for it. We wouldn't be mods, and we would be kill. So don't tell me that mods are notorious for using for our own good. When if someone does that, they get punished for it.   So if you know of an exploit, then tell someone higher up (Matto, Bloody, Narroby, Me, or will) so we can let Gus/Keth know, so they fix the game.

"I am no fan of the majority either but for example: NGNL and Aldnoah.Zero were both very much loved animé by the  mass  like SAO2 and UBW now. The 'critics' rate both shows lower than the ratehappy mass thus they'd give them both a 5/6 while the mass would r8 8/8 or something like that. You rated NGNL low while Aldnoah.Zero for example pretty high, which is unusual I think.  Overall, you haven't watched a lot of  strange  shows or hidden gems which some people purely watch to seem more elitist or at least get that effect so on first glance your list looks a bit like you are dull and mainstream (pls don't interpret that as an insult from me)  But... As I continued to also look at your (huge) plan to watch, I would like to point out that Katanagatari, Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Eureka Seven are part of my all time favourites, and pretty unknown shows like Suisei no Gargantia and Tales of the Abyss are also really good. To add since you seem to love TTGL (which I haven't watched yet, should I?) you will probably love Diebuster (so in reverse I should watch TTGL by my own logic)  Diebuster is only 6 episodes and the sequel to an '80s show called Gunbuster, both by Gainax. Gunbuster is also 6 episodes and is regarded as one of the defining trendsetters to mecha animé. It may not look too good but it aged pretty well and has a great ending.  Diebuster is the sequel that plays 12,000 years later. You can technically watch it without Gunbuster but Diebuster, while it has the TTGL artstyle, nice characters and a cool story, the ending is where it's at.  This ending I literally saw 10 minutes ago and it was really good but without having seen Gunbuster it wouldn't have been as great. I don't know what your opinion is towards clannad and afterstory, but most people see clannad as a  have to go through first sigh . Gunbuster isn't like that because it's 4 times as short and a pretty good show as of itself that will also fit in with your taste.",0,1417211810,PostYourMAL,1,0

Srslite stop this witchhunt, remember the Boston bombing? Well this patriot said stay classy, highschool kids. 'Entry level' jobs str8 outta talesfromtechsupport. I fail to see what this has to do with my post, because it's like trying to explain algebra to a 3 year old- the greatest wingman of all time made 2 am chili. OP delivered (I'm not even mad that we did it live). To be fair, I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly. Lost it at 'welcome to jackass' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risk click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. What a story, Mark, really a cool story, bro. CTRL+F  about tree fiddy  was not disappointed. Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. Sigh *unzips* No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? /r/im14andthisiscopypasta Politics must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. *woosh* I have the weirdest boner right now.  &amp;nbsp;  TL;DR: Upvotes to the left. Socrates died for this jackdaw, but I see your bringing WTF back to its roots and raise you an NSFL [NSFW] [x-post /r/marijaunaenthusiasts] [repost] [low effort]  edit: downvotes? Really? Lol my highest comment is about porn /r/nocontext and thanks for the gold kind stranger! P.s.

I'll do this in the middle of my school's quad so students can see the magnificence that is the mancoon.  Once I am completely covered and the wax has dried, I'll break free and emerge as a new person.  Stronger, faster, smarter, and all around more handsome.  I then take my wax mold and give it to charity, because I'm a nice guy.  I'll do this every once in a while to kill some time.

"I got my teeth stuck in a tree house when I tried to throw something from the window and tumbled over the side.  Caught the ledge with one hand and flipped over, slamming my face into the side of the thing. Voila, teeth in tree house.  Edit: I have also almost dislocated my hip several times whilst pooping.  Edit 2: The Poopening-  It was never tested, but I am fairly certain I was born with an adult's intestinal tract. When I was little, I was constantly constipated. At the worst of times, I would go a week or so without taking a dump. Every now and then I would push a little too hard while in the wrong position, and I would feel my femur start to pop out of my hip. It had that crunchy bone-on-bone feel. Trying to poop for the first time in a week while also trying to pop your hip back into place is an odd experience.   It was both a pain in the ass, and a pain in my side.  I grew into my colon towards the end of high school, which I am very thankful for. Haven't had to deal with that since.  2/10, would not recommend.  (3/10 with rice)",0,1417643838,AskReddit,70,0

"I'm gay. Never wanted to have sex with a woman until I was about 18 to just get it out of the way.   Not wanting to have sex with a girl also included not wanting/caring to learn about all their tidbits.  But there was always this weird smell that came off from some girls at different times....  This smell made me question everything that I knew about women and I set off to find out what this smelly smell was.   Without alerting any of my female friends that I KNEW THEIR SECRET, their secret of this Underground Railroad of the smells, i looked online to see what it was.   Kinda anticlimactic, but, I read that girls have blood and stuff that comes out of their turtle necks and that I have the unfortunate power of smelling it.     Obviously he's not gay or anything but just chiming in on the fact that I didn't know exactly what was going on and then I brought it upon myself to find out. 0/10 with rice,  wish I never read that wiki.",0,1417674278,AskReddit,1,0

SPOILER: There is just one. A single one. From 2004. Before anyone knew who he was and he'd just won the U-15 Irish Open. Paul McGinley is referred to as one, but since he's from Dublin and is an Irish citizen, that's pretty damn accurate.

"Support... Oh god, I don't know why people don't like to play it. It's my main role and even after playing so much I'm still learning new things from it. And the most annoying thing about being a support isn't the fact you have to die for your teammates or that you get no kills in the whole match. Is the fact that when you know how to support and rotate, and the enemy doesn't, you have to stay in lane longer because your Adc is going to be in danger fighting against two people, and if the enemy jungle ganks him/her, three. Is really bad how a lot of players in casual don't know the current meta for support in conquest, I don't know how many times I had to force the enemy support to get out of the lane so I can start rotating better. Support is fun to play, if you like to help people and you don't care that much about your K/D ratio Well, it's my opinion at least. Don't h8 it's gr8 I r8 8/8.

During the tour, Suyin introduced her sons, Wei and Wing, who were in the midst of playing power disc. Wei was able to score on Wing by hitting the metal disc off a pillar and over his brother's head. Suyin complimented Wei on his shot, and he celebrated by gesturing and declaring that Wing had gone down. Wing showed his frustration by hitting the ground with his fists. &gt;They later sat down to dinner with their family, minus their father and eldest brother who were busy with their projects, and guests. The siblings remained silent throughout the whole exchange between their mother and guests.  &gt;==== &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/75pROf4.png) [^(i)](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/5/58/Wei_and_Wing_sparring_with_Bolin_and_Korra.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width/200?cb=20141031172728)==== &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/goAr8Z2.png) [^(i)](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/8/8a/Wei%2C_Wing%2C_Lin%2C_and_Suyin.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width/200?cb=20141031172738)==== &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/FRqDWP8.png) [^(i)](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/3/3b/Suyin%2C_Wei%2C_and_Wing_discovered.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width/200?cb=20141109212259)  ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmmw3i7) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cmmw3i7)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikiabot/wiki/index) ^|  [^Source](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py)  ^(Please note this bot is in testing.

"Yeah, in the Bay of Plenty. I was there during the 'Enough is Enough' Destiny church marches. We sent teachers along as our representatives and had full-school (Bethlehem College goes from primary to secondary) assemblies detailing why we as Christians should be appalled.  I know the environment was not gay-friendly and very ridiculously heteronormative. The idea that a student was possibly not heterosexual never crossed the schools mind. For example I kissed another boy in school and to the school councillors and teachers dealing with the issue  I was acting out . My sexuality was never questioned.   I recall my teacher in English making us do a book report on 'Deadline' which has seriously anti-LGBT themes and very violent themes. This was in Year 8. The protagonists daughter catches HIV and her partner is at fault because he's bisexual. Pretty much the theme is that bisexuality gives AIDs and HIV to the straight population and our teacher told us as such. The disease was also viewed as a punishment for homosexuality by our teacher.   Sexual Health focused solely on heterosexuality and abstinence, or waiting until you were married. Masturbation wasn't mentioned and as a student I brought it up and was scolded.  The school councillor was also known to not keep the confidence of students. So he wasn't a member of staff you could trust.  During my time there a principal stepped down so a teacher could keep their job at the school after hitting a student.   Oh and the BOT rep refused to represent the international students and was openly a Neo-Nazi. Later he had to apologise in an assembly after getting caught having oral with a girl in the school toilets.  2/10 3/10 with rice",0,1417946757,newzealand,17,0

"Well, when I was young, perhaps 2 - 3 years old, I went to a really cool island off the coast of Tanzania called Zanzibar. My family and I were out chilling at a beach side restaurant after a long day of trekking through the historic town. I, being the excitable, animal-loving 2-3 year old I was, spotted a dog and ran off to go and pet it, without telling my parents of course. When my food arrived, my parents sent my older brother to go and find me.   Of course, my brother found me, minus most of my chin. My brother, being the 5-6 year old he was, ran back to my parents making  Wee-aw  noises like an ambulance with his arms swinging wildly above his head. My parents rush to where my brother had told them I was and called the ambulance, having me rushed to a local hospital. When I got to the hospital I had a bunch of stitches put in had my chin repaired by the doctors. All I remember from that day is waking up in a high ceilinged room with plenty of pain in my chin and a huge scar running horizontally across the gap between my chin and bottom lip.  2/10, would not recommend  5/10 with rice, though!",0,1417960972,AskReddit,13,0

"This past thanksgiving morning. I woke up to a missed called, and two texts from my ex. We broke up about two months prior, but we both still had feelings for each other. She is one that needs attention, and since she is 3 hours away from me I cant give it to her like the guys around her. So when she moves in, she has the biggest douche bag from our high school class going to the same school. They were on good terms before, and now get closer since they know each other and are around each other. My ex, who was dating me at the time, didn't listen to me when I told her not to speak to douchebag's roommate cause they're all shit people. She doesn't listen, goes over to his room sober, and cheats on me with douchebags roommate. Break up the 29th of September, on and off back and forward blowing up at each other because we both still want to be together but now it won't cause its too much of a mess. I go and fuck my other ex for comfort and to cross it off the list (hadn't fucker her prior, 0/10 would do again, 1/10 with rice). She called me on the Saturday before thanksgiving calling me a hypocrite for sleeping with her and shit and whatever. Didn't Care, I was single and she was slutting it up with guys when she went out on the weekends.   Anyway, thanksgiving morning she tells me she did something she feels guilty about and it wasn't too get back on me. I figure she fucked douchebags roommate and felt crushed by it. I don't know why, but I just did. I was balling my eyes out for like 20 minutes at 7 in the morning before starting my day. I just tell myself to get over it and ignore it. She was in town, so we met up, got some head from her, went home for the night. Text her the next day asking what actually happened. Turns out she fucked douchebag. Who had a thing with my ex's roommate. So they have an incestuous friend group and I lost almost all respect for her since her telling me that.  Tl;Dr Women suck.",0,1418007028,AskReddit,1,0

"For a part time job, it's a dream.  8/10  10/10 with rice.  I started at $12.something/hr. Raises are scheduled 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and then every year after that. After 200 (I think) hours worked you get up to $15,000 tuition reimbursement, so it's perfect if you want to also take some classes.  Benefits start at 1000 hours and include medical, dental, vision, etc. I'm not sure of the extent since I haven't hit that 1000 hour mark yet, sorry.  I get discounts on a ton of cool shit. Some things make sense (75% off fedex express, 50% off fedex ground) some don't (Disney World, Restaurants.com) Others include Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, I think every major cellular provider actually.  Our bosses are about our safety (warning - I've heard from people who worked at other locations that some bosses only care about saving/making money, but I suppose that goes with any chain) and are understanding of sick time, time off, etc. Starting at some point I know we get paid sick/vacation time.   Once the 1000 hours kicks in you also get 3x pay for holidays if part-time, and 7x pay if full-time (there aren't many full-time positions that aren't management though).  Some dislikes are just personal. I drive 30 minutes to work which is kind of lame, but I carpool so gas is split and I have somebody to chat with. I work  inbound  starting at roughly 3am - 8am with schedule variances. Overnight is kind of weird, but I've gotten used to it. You *will* be sore the first few weeks if you don't regularly workout.  If you get injured or aren't able to lift heavy things there's still some jobs you can do, I won't get too much into that unless you're interested more. However, most jobs can really be done by anybody since you have people to help.  The schedule is pretty much set. It's the best part-time schedule I've ever had. Tuesday - Saturday, although now it's Monday - Saturday for peak season.  The hiring process is rather annoying. You have to  watch a sort  which you schedule online then attend. It takes about 20 minutes then they email you an actual application. After the application they do a phone interview, which is basically asking if you're willing/able to pick shit up and move it around. After that you get another call scheduling for orientation. Then before your orientation you fill our a W-2 or W-4, I don't even remember.  My whole process took about 10 days, but it was worth it.  TL;DR: It's a great part-time job with good benefits.",0,1418059194,IAmA,210,0

After the application they do a phone interview, which is basically asking if you're willing/able to pick shit up and move it around. After that you get another call scheduling for orientation. Then before your orientation you fill our a W-2 or W-4, I don't even remember.  My whole process took about 10 days, but it was worth it.  TL;DR: It's a great part-time job with good benefits.",0,1418061273,IAmA,142,0

"~~What is this, this appeared on my screen? And when I click back, the post is gone :P Sorry if my comment is stupid, ill delete it if it gets downvotes~~  Edit: ok I don't know why this popped up at the hearthstone reddit page, with no explanation in the OP but thanks for /user/Oxydam for the explanation.  For my entry: I usually watch movies just at home boring all alone, but this one time I went with 2 of my mates to Slumdog Millionare. Oh boy that movie was so great, I'd recommend it to anyone. One of my friends decided to bring food from outside (which is forbidden, and note getting something to eat is so expensive in cinemas). He sneaks a bag of crisp's by putting it inside his sweater. So we get fairly easy inside and are watching the movie for like an hour. When suddenly my friend decides to eat some crisps. I swear the movie is on all sound all the time, and right when an important moment hits where there is nothing but silence, my mate decides to open the bag and put one big fat crisp in hit mouth. I remember that one bite of him as if it was yesterday. *KKGGRPPP* . I felt embarrassed and joyed at the same time (don't know how to put it). I couldn't resist but to laugh because the sound was just too perfect, but alot of people were looking our way :P   Anyway great movie i r8 it 8/8. I don't know what to exactly link, as it is described as pick a 'product'. I searched the redditgift thingy and couldn't find anything related. However if I do win, i'd like someone (random) else to get it :) I'm feeling generous today.  Edit2: God, i am so stupid. It doesn't have to be a related gift..

I'm pretty good for noting Poes and trolls if I do say so myself, so this one was great in being just ever so slightly over the top. The things that clued me in:  -&gt; Scandinavian Rape Culture, them being aware about their doublethink (normally this is fine but this time it isn't because it isn't this time), endorsing rioting openly as opposed to tacitly, putting Jews as the insect-shamans, and the allocating of stats meaning the player is literally a nazi.

"I think most Americans have a buffet ritual. When it comes to the economy of a buffet, you are paying a set price and the value goes up the more you eat. With Vegas-Style buffets that can include steak and other more expensive dishes, the typical strategy is just gorge on the hot ticket items and avoid things that fill you like bread and vegetables. Here is the strategy that I recommend:  So, my buffet ritual is to avoid all salads. I don't even get why they offer a salad (well I understand why--they are trying to cheat me out of my money). Go straight for the steak, lobster, sushi cuts, etc. in Plate 1 so you can be sure you maximize your buffet economy.  In baseball, you can usually trust the leadoff hitter to at least make it to base. This will ensure that your meal is off to a good start, and place you ahead of the buffet's finances as far as economy goes.   Plate two is more of plate one, but now you can add in other dishes that look interesting or expensive. If there is a foreign food, now is the time to give it a try. Still avoid any carb-heavy dishes and salad.  Plate 3 is where it can get more interesting. Grab some more of the plate 1 dishes, but now feel free to add anything. Aim for foods you know you enjoy. Plate 2 was to allow you to try new things, and is early enough in the eating order that you won't be too full for an experience. Part of the unseen buffet economy is that you are also paying to taste dishes you otherwise would not have ordered off a menu. Never tried sushi? Give it is a shot in Plate 2 but aim for pieces that don't have the rice. Too much new food can upset your digestive track and cause it to fill with gasses. To prepare for the rest of the meal, plate 3 allows you to go back to what you know and what will agree with your intestinal bacteria.  Plate 4 is some more of plate 1, but now go for appetizer foods. Things you can just eat with your fingers so the fine motor muscles that typically move a fork and knife can have a rest. Dishes with dipping sauces are perfect, as they will help the finger foods slide down your throat easier, and then your throat will be lubricated for the next plate.  Plate 5 is the final plate of main courses. Grab as much steak, lobster, and other expensive items that you can handle. Get more than you think you can handle, and force it down. You want to maintain a good buffet economy. If there was another dish you really enjoyed, get just a small portion of it. Remember, the key is to eat steak and lobster. The buffet economy secret is in the expensive meats.  Plate 6 is the desert plate. Many buffets have slices of cake, pie, cupcakes, or a soft serve. Get at least 2, and load it up with the squirt bottles of chocolate syrup or caramel syrup. You are paying for the syrups, and if you do not use them then it is money down the drain and the buffet is winning. It is advised that you eat a warmer desert than ice cream, as ice cream is cold and will contract the stomach, reducing space.  Plate 7 is plate 1 again. You have now filled up, but if your esophagus isn't to the brim then you can swallow one more lobster tail. At this point in the meal you may have taken your shirt off to allow more room.  Plate 8 is the final plate. If you were doing a good job, this plate will be smaller and be difficult to see behind the tears. This plate should consist of steak and lobster. Remember to avoid cards. Do no grab bread. You should be full enough from the protein to not need carbs, and it may be dangerous to ingest carbs at this rate. If you still feel hungry or not full, then grab more steak and lobster.  So there you go. This is the ritual to maximize your buffet economy. Using this strategy you can have a  10/10 Buffet experience  7/10 with rice",0,1418142372,AskReddit,264,0

"I dated a very pretty mtf girl for a couple weeks.. after about a week,I had sex with her 3 times over the course of a couple days. Then she stopped returning my calls.  Anyway, I met her at work when she was there waiting to pick her sister up. She was from brazil and very tan, hot, and exotic looking. I talked to her for about ten minutes, but had no idea of her secret as she was totally feminine and petite in every way... and only about 5'3  tall.  When I said what are you doing tonight, can I get your number? She right away just said  but I am boy  ...I'm like whaaa?  I have penis  she says. My wiener processed this faster than my mind could; in the half second it took me to figure out what this godess was saying, I could have hammered nails with my shit. I had always fantasized about being with a transexual girl.  So we went out just about every night, spent a couple nights and days together for a week, then finally did the deed...  In the past I had had a girlfriend who loved to toss my salad and finger me, and it felt great. I'm the type of person that thinks like if it felt that good, a cock must feel even better. Also, even though I can't see myself ever doing a guy, cocks are pretty neeto in themselves.  So I get undressed, and my little 5 inch warrior is throbbing at full attention. This cute little tiny girl whips out the cock of a greek god. I'm in awe of it. About 9 scary thick inches of up-curved perfect beauty. A bit of 69 laying on our sides, she fingers me with lube to get me ready...  Soon she is easing her huge member into my little virgin asshole. Very slow and not all of it for a long time. I had taken 3 10 mg percs to deal with some of the pain, but mostly so I wouldn't cum to soon. I did pretty good overall, especially considering I thought I would just bust before she could get it in.  She pretty much half shafted me for about 10 minutes, as I just couldn't take any more of her. She knew what was up and was obviously pretty good at this... when I said I was going to cum, she quickly worked it all the way in and started doing short strokes really fast. I pretty much had a 5 minute orgasm at that point. It felt like I was cumming the whole time but I couldn't get any fluid out until the end.  This is the thing though... I was on my feet squatting on the bed while she stood up. She was able to suck my cock while fucking my ass. I wish I could find porn where this is done lol.  I've had sex with a lot of women, but this was by far the most intense thing I have ever experienced. It was like a whole body orgasm that lasted forever. Like my soul was cumming. Beyond anything ever imagined, all 3 times we boned.  10/10 would recommend. ...and of course 11/10 with rice.",0,1418316402,AskReddit,4,0

I need to work out...  &gt; What are you skilled at beyond the norm?  Chess. Low level logical thinking? (I figured concepts of Dunning Kruger, no free will, confirmation bias on my own...)  &gt; How often do you floss your teeth?  Every day  &gt; Do you ASMR?  Makes me uncomfortable so no.  &gt; What's your favourite bread?  Soft gingerbread  &gt; What's your favourite meat?  Steak  &gt; On a scale of 1-10, how would you rank your own intelligence?  7 - 8, 8 being college profs. I'm probably a 7 then.  &gt; On a scale of 1-10, how would you rank your own attractiveness?  7 - 5   &gt; What is your favourite season?  Warm summer  &gt; What is your job? How do you like it?  Summer job: research assistant. Its lonely...  &gt; Do you suffer from a mental illness? If so, are you being treated?  Probably not.  &gt; What's your favourite snack food?  No favorite but most often - peanut butter  &gt; Do you have kids? Do you want kids in the future?  No but I'm open to it.  &gt; If you could change one thing about yourself what would you change?  I spend too much time clicking through pages of already clicked links on reddit instead of doing something productive. Getting better every day tho.  &gt; What's your favourite RPG?  I don't remember anything about it but Golden Sun was amazing. I actually really dislike the concept of RPG's now.  &gt; How would you react if a really attractive person (whatever you define as attractive) started flirting with you?  Flirt back. If it ever gets down to a regular getting to know you conversation, I'm dead in the water.  &gt; What is your impression of this subreddit's community as a whole?  Just reddit, except anime fans. And with more judging going on than usual.  &gt; Are you happy?  I haven't thought to myself I'm happy since the beginning of the semester so I probably have to fix that. Probably has something to do with my sleep schedule. Not unhappy tho...   Why don't you answer the questions yourself? :)",0,1418362300,anime,2,0

"Pretty much yeah, your money would've been better spent else where. The game is an alpha and will probably always be an alpha (the development is ungodly slow).

"Well....after finally getting over my engagement, which after long review was pretty damn toxic, I met this girl on tinder.   After a few weeks of talking we exchanged numbers and shortly thereafter agreed to meet and go out. First  date  was a little awkward; neither one of us is exactly a social butterfly. We went pretty slow for about the first month/month and a half and we were (and still are to some extent) a little afraid to be totally open with emotion and feels and the like.  But, we're somewhere around the three month mark now and she's just wonderful. She's always complementing me and encouraging me. So far she's just completely there for me and completely understanding of me. She's genuinely interested in getting to know who I am. She just wants me to be happy and to make me happy and it shows through everything she does and says when we're with each other.   And the sex is fantastic. She's all about me and I'm all about her, it's beautiful really. I'm not at the  love  stage yet...but I'm pretty sure it's getting there. Pretty quickly. She's just a beautiful, wonderful woman all around.  11/10 with rice.",0,1418404146,AskMen,2,0

Buddy Holly is shorter, faster, and more peppy; Say it ain't so is more somber and depressing; My Name is Jonas is a bit of both. You can also go with Island in the Sun, their most popular song. It is a really nice feel good song, and really catchy. Weezer is a really good band. 8/10 would recommend. 9/10 with rice, very nice.   And thanks for the explanation of sorts.

"If you're happy doing the exact same thing over and over again then more power to you. What I'm saying as a fellow artist is that I don't think that I could stand singing the same song my whole life, so I don't understand how an actor could love playing the same character their whole life.  I definitely know that I don't want to see someone play the same character their whole life. This is the End is one of my favorite movies of all time, but even if Rogen and Franco managed to emulate the humor in that movie perfectly I would still be disappointed. It's natural for people's desires to change.  Reddit once loved the idea of  the narwhal bacons at midnight,  but it was so overused that almost anyone who recognizes it groans. Right now people are still making  10/10 with rice  jokes, but in a week or two I guarantee it's going to be dead.  Just because something was once funny and fresh doesn't mean it always will be. Jokes are like socks, they may be comfy the first few hundred times you use them, but after time and frequent use they begin to stink and they don't look like how they once did.",0,1418830419,news,1,0

"What did I just say.  Right, I need to bitch about this to someone, but the filmmakers missed the point of the first one. The first one was like a game due to the camera angles, progression, way that the lead char found items and information...hell, they could have put subtitles on the screen saying  You have found FLASHLIGHT  and it would have been fine. They also didn't overuse elements, either, so each monster felt special.  SH:Revelations was just a fuck fest of poorly inserted references (the ending...too many refs), gimmicky shots, poor writing, shit progression, and overuse of Pyramid Head to the point of him being  meh . I'm shit with horrors, and the first one genuinely scared me, but the second one I almost walked out of due to it being tedious.  And to top it all off, they did their best to remove any ambiguity that they cultivated in the first film.  2/10.

"My personal thoughts of the Top 20 as the show progresses. Keep in mind that these are just my views of the song, and may not reflect your views or /r/trance’s views of the song as a whole.  Pre-Show: Aww yiss, GDJB.  Sad note that Markus is skipping the City Compilation this year and instead doing a  World Tour 2015,  where he'll release 1 new track every month dedicated to a city.  :(  Currently Playing: Solarstone &amp; Orkidea - Slowmotion III  mmmmm followed by some  In The Shadows.   But then he follows that with his new track  Winter Kills Me.  :-/   Not a big fan.  Final Thoughts: The addition of  138  over the past year or so will *hopefully* affect the Top 20 away from what it has been the past few years, but you never know.  Personal thoughts are that Ping Pong and U will be Top 3.  On Fire should be up there as well.  ...here we go!  **ASOT EOYC 2014 Thoughts**  25-21: The tease again this year on what could have been...  25) Dash Berlin...meh.  Decent tune for  Here Tonight,  but nothing spectacular.  24) Mmmm, that's more like it.  L'Absente  definitely received some votes on our own Top 20 poll, and who can argue with the melody these two have created? Both have definitely been churning out some great tunes the past year or so.  23) Thrillseekers! Good showing with  This is All We Have.   Glad to see it got ranked so highly; hopefully we still have some great tunes to go!  22) What a superb song and remix.  Love Dart Rayne's work this year.  Vocals sound fresh.  And Allen &amp; Envy have just been killing it with remix duties lately.  Well deserved play.  21) Alex M.O.R.P.H. with his yearly  Angel's Love  follow-up, and every year it just drifts that much more into  eh  that replicating the wonder from a few years ago.  Above average track, but that's about it this year for Mr. MORPH I'm afraid.    Now the Top 20...  or not...some of Armin's favorites not in Top 20:  50) Sneijder &amp; Bryan Kearney - Next Level.  Armin surprised it's not in Top 20.  Sadly I'm not.  39) Philippe El Sisi &amp; Abstract Vision ft Jilliana Danise - This Time.  Great tune out of place.  83) In Armin's Top 10: Allen Watts - Blackout  Now the  **TOP 20**  20) ...I just can't get into this Aly &amp; Fila // Jaren combination anymore.  Just not my cup of tea.  Decent song in my personal opinion, but doesn't do anything for me.  19) Two songs in, two vocals from Aly &amp; Fila.  Positive: we have 100% more uplifting this year in the Top 20 than the entire last year.  Downside: Looks like Aly &amp; Fila Control The Top 20 this year with their album release. Or maybe that's a positive depending on your view.   18) More vocals.  More mediocre remixes of Armin's work.  Bobina not on form.  Sounds like a ASOT #trancefamily Top 20.  The original wasn't even the best on Armin's last album.  And even if you enjoy Big Room and Trouse (which I'll admit I do), this still is a meh track.  Not inspired by anything whatsoever.  17) Ctrl+C  The Other Shore  tracklist.  Ctrl+V  Top 20 of 2014.   Hint to voters: there were other artists that released tracks this year.  Still, great melody and probably one of my favorites on  The Other Shore  this year.  Roger Shah back in better form than what he's produced otherwise this year (or last to be honest).    16) Decent track from MarLo.  Jano's voice is always nice to hear.  Not perhaps MarLo's best work ever, but probably one of the highlights from him this year.   Our vocal trek continues at 5/5.  15) It's true this song is  One in a Million.  Doesn't make it any good though. 1/10.  2/10 with rice.  14) Is it the best anthem ever created? Nah.  Cygnus X holds that honor.  Or maybe Rank 1.  Still, definitely a solid production by Jorn that at least has all the right elements for a good anthem in today's era of trance music.  13) Interested to see how Blue Sky Action is (potentially) out-performing  Sticky Fingers  from the trio.  Personally I enjoyed Sticky Fingers a lot more than BSA.  Alex's vocals on this really don't do it for me on this track.  Nor the melody that much...nothing special from A&amp;B.  12) Not a fan of Dash Berlin's recent works.  But my gosh does Photographer know how to completely change a track around for the better.  Superb remix.  Definitely highly up-voted here on /r/trance every time it's been posted so far.  Shame it didn't score higher in the Top 20.  11) Another MarLo track.  It's got an interesting breakdown that grew on me over a few listens. Might not be everyone's choice for the 11th best tune of the year (not in my personal Top 30, for example), but hey, there are definitely less deserving tunes that could have been voted here instead.  It's one of those tracks that IMO works 10x better live than over the radio.  10) Another Rayel track.  Not a fan of this shift from 2012 after things like  550 Senta,  but I enjoy the vocals on this song.  Definitely one of Rayel's better tracks this year.  9) Apparently I didn't keep up with ASOT as much this year, because I really don't know where the Top 20 Love for Bobina is coming from (Aly &amp; Fila I understand...).  Good piano breakdown on the song; a bit long though.  8) F the haters.  This track rules live.  PING. PONG. (Edit: I know it's not really trance.  Some acid influences, but still...)  7) I'm a fan of the KhoMha remix personally.  Another one of those Armin tunes that should stick with the live play and not radio.  But to be Top 10 is not unexpected on his own show.  6) Love the intro part of this track from Cosmic Gate.  Surprised the Sixma remix was used here.  Despite that, still a decent tune from this year.  5) Armin + Rayel on an ASOT Track? No surprise this made #5.  You can definitely hear more of Rayel's influence I think for the underlying beat with Armin's classic breakdown.  It's good for the big room perhaps.    4) We get away from the Big Room to go back to some proper uplifting trance.  Surprised this ended up only at #4, considering that it was supposedly in the hunt for #1 a few weeks ago.   **2013 Top 3 were played next**  3) Apprehension was a superb tune.  2) RAMelia a bit over-rated and only got there from the story behind the song IMO.  1) Armin van Buuren - Intense probably one of Armin's best from the past few years.  **2012**  1) Never was a fan of Concrete Angel.  **2011**  1) Nor We Control The Sunlight  **2010**  1) But Yuri Kane? Mmmmhmm.   **Back to 2014**  3) Surprised to see The Reason up so high.  I still think  Dreams  between this duo was their best work.  2) Not the worst Gaia track ever produced (that award goes to Stellar), but I think Humming The Lights surpasses this track by a considerable margin.  The breakdown here is nice though.  Still, it's a Armin and Benno track, so it's getting top places.  1) I'm assuming as I still listen to Gaia in the background that it's going to be Gareth Emery's  U.   Which is disappointing to me since I have the same feelings towards the song that I do towards Concrete Angel: overplayed, uninspired, and meh vocals.  At least Gareth shifted up his vocal crew this time.  For someone who's been dabbling mostly in the Big Room and Electro House scene and recently switched their radio show up to include Deep House as well, it really is amazing how he's claimed the Top Tune of the Year on ASOT 2 of the past 3 years.  Doing something right to the masses.  Edit: The Bryan Kearney remix is being played. Redemption.    **Overall Thoughts**  13/20 Vocals.  Lot more big room than I was expecting.  Aly &amp; Fila taking the cake this year despite (surprisingly high) showings from Rayel and Bobina.  Armin of course has his tracks place high, but surprisingly not as high as I originally thought.  Bryan Kearney remix saves the end IMO, but still, not a fan of the overall outcome of the Top 20.    Once the list of all votes is posted, I'll scroll through and post some highlights on where some popular (and not so popular) songs ended up.   **Top 100 Tracks [Here](http://www.astateoftrance.com/news/top-100-tracks-of-the-year-revealed/)**  My Personal Top 5:  Andrew Bayer - Once Lydain (#32) Above &amp; Beyond - Mariana Trench (Carl Overnet 140 Remix) (Hahaha, no) Rex Mundi - Static Room (Lol no) Bart Claessen - Playmo (Aaron Camz Bootleg) (Definitely not) Sasha - Xpander (Tucandeo Extended Bootleg) (Never to be found)   Other interesting Top 100 Tracks:  26) Above &amp; Beyond - Satellite (ilan Bluestone Remix)  37) Omnia - Tomorrow People  The WTF ones:  38) Simon Patterson - Brush Strokes  48) Armin van Buuren - Beautiful Life   53) Andrew Rayel &amp; Bobina - Sacramentum  Not only were these three songs from *2013*, but the past two made the *Top 15* of 2013.  Seriously?!?!  54) Parker &amp; Hanson - Gravity   Criminally low  60) Monoverse - Fraction.  Congrats /u/Excess34 for Top 100!  63) Max Graham - Evil ID  Seems low  77) W&amp;W - Bigfoot  Surprised it wasn't higher TBH",0,1418926023,trance,20,0

"If that was bait then you should try to improve. Bait is only really good when it's at the level of subtley that a majority of people understand it and a handful don't. If everyone thinks your just a dumb cunt then it's not bait, it's just you being fucking stupid. If 75% get that it's bait and 25% bite then you've got some good bait.

"From Michigan.  Went to Tennessee over Thanksgiving. Trying to keep up on working out, so I get a couple of day passes for a Golds gym in Chattanooga.   One thing I notice right off rip is the level of attractive people in Chattanooga compared to Detroit. I mean everyone in this gym looked good. So I'm with my gf's brother who also came down with his long term gf. We finally got away from the girls and the whole family scene and we are working out upper back, scoping the scene as you do.  I make eye contact with this 8/10 and she smiles at us (probably the brother). Well she is with a typical skinny college dude, full Under Armour gear and wearing a shitty sense of entitlement. He starts giving the girl shit right away.  I am past the age of having anything to prove. So I grab the brother and fuck off to the other side of the gym. We keep working out on some equipment I have never even seen before.   We round the gym after about 30 min or so and end up at the resistance machine by the bench area and there is college boy and his 10/10 with rice. She is spotting him on the incline. Right away I can tell dude is threatened because he ups his bench two plates for a total of four plates and two quarters. I really pay him no mind and I keep working on delts.  Then I hear  oh my god  and this dude is being crushed by the bar. I mean he is half off the bench trying to throw the bar off of him and 7/10 thanks for the suggestion is fumbling at the bar.  Instinct kicks in and I run right over to get the bar off if him and so does this big black dude, we pick up the bar and set it. College's pride was hurt so he couldn't even muster a  thanks . We walked away and I heard him giving the girl shit for not spotting him correctly. he backs off the weight 140lbs and keeps pressing. I've had enough at this point and leave.  We jump in the rental and it pops in my head.  DO YOU EVEN LIFT RESPONSIBLE, BRO?  is what I should have said.

"Alright. A little late, but here goes.  Friday morning my older brother drove me to school, which was nice because he had only gotten back from college the day before. Because of block scheduling for finals, I had only two classes, only one actual final, and a short day. First  final  was choir, so we just had a potluck and exchanged gifts for our Secret Santa (I got a bunch of Magic the Gathering cards from my friend). Some people who were in choir last year and graduated showed up, including my brother, so it was nice to see them again too.   After choir, I hung out with a bunch of my friends in the library during the break between finals, including a girl that I sort of half have a crush on. After the break, me and the girl started going to our English final and we ran into my crush. I lent her my calculator for her Physics final and we went on our way.   After English (which was boring as fuck but the teacher kept giving us cookies) me and the girl waited out in the back of the school in the rain for my crush to get back my calculator. We waited for a while while my crush went to the opposite end of the school and back looking for me, but when she did show up, she kept thanking me and saying I saved her ass and stuff like that. (Warning: perv alert) Since it was raining out, she kept leaning over to blow off my calculator and wipe it dry, and she was wearing a rather loose shirt, so that was nice. (This perv alert has been completed.) she told me to have a good break and happy holidays and all that.   After the two of them left, I went with a bunch of my friends to the McDonalds down the road from my school for lunch. There, we got exactly 200 chicken McNuggets in a biannual celebration that we call Nugmas. After we finished the meal, we sat there singing Nugmas carols around a pile of chicken nugget boxes we called the Nugmas tree and trying not to throw up.   After Nugmas was done, I went home and played Brawl with my brother, and then went bowling with a bunch of friends I hadn't seen in a while.   9/10 beginning of break, 10/10 with rice.",0,1419183272,teenagers,1,0

"are you &gt;implying every single joke on reddit hasn't been overdone 1000 times?  *clears throat*  To be fair, I did nazi that coming. I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10. 10/10 with rice xd, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F  about tree fiddy  was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as  NOPE NOPE NOPE ? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!!

At 1440P the 290X is more powerful than the 970 by a good margin, and the 290 is better as well although by not as much. They both have a superior memory bandwidth.   I'm running dual 290's, I bought my first when they released at $400 and my second used from a friend for $240. Together they basically slaughter everything. it's gr8 m8 I r8 8/8",0,1419261043,buildapc,2,0

"I have two, one from spice (fake weed, k2, bayou blaster, whatever) and one from tequila and beer. I've told the one about the alcohol a few times on this site. Basically I had 6 shots of tequila and 2 beers, blacked out, projectile vomited all over the floor, and drove home with no pants on while still blacked out. It's a horror story because of how damned embarrassing it was. Never drank again after that. The one from the spice was more intense. I'm 18 years old, doing dual enrollment at the local community college. Your typical smart kid gets into some dumb shit scenario. Roll up a spice joint in the paper from one of them Djarum cigarillos. Split it between me and 3 of my friends. 3 friends go to class, so I finish the thing because who am I to waste fake weed? Panic. The worst panic attack I have ever had. None of my sober panic attacks came anywhere close to that feeling. Sober panic attacks are fucking mild compared to this shit. Anyway, I'm panicking and seeing shit, and I'm a bit (or a lot) delusional. This guy Scott is hanging out with me, and he looks like WASPy Jesus because of his long hair and beard. So naturally, I think he's Jesus. I pray to Jesus, asking him to call the ambulance if I pass out. Literally thought I was going to die. Didn't die though.

"There's an old Mexican tale of a lady who went to the market one day to buy food and stuff. So she has her baby in a wrap strapped to her front. She goes to buy some chicaron (pork rinds I guess in English, but it's fried pork stomach lining, sounds gross but it's 10/10 with rice) and she basically leans over the big ass tub of boiling oil for frying and guess what. The baby slips out the wrap and falls in. She of course tries to catch it, but she throws her arms in trying to get it out. Obviously the baby died horribly and the mother lost both her arms.   Edit: so chicharon is pork skin, I always used to think it was the stomach. Usually, if not always, it will have a layer of meat attached too. You can buy this stuff at any Latin ethnic store, like Northgate Gonzales supermarket, El Super, etc. If you go anywhere else they will probably be processed and packaged like chips, you won't get the good fresh kind. It's also expensive, like $10 a pound, but a pound is more than enough for someone.",0,1419416642,WTF,174,0

I know that was supposed to be metaphoric, but the kids constantly talking about 'the match' and mom finally 'wearing the shirt' seemed vague and unrealistic.

"Call the cops. Her behavior is dangerous and completely unacceptable.  You might find it a challenge to strike out on your own, especially while battling depression and anxiety. While it will take time and patience with yourself, I hope you will find that once you're independent of her, it will be easier to start to heal. If you aren't currently seeing a therapist, I highly recommend it once you're more financially stable--was a positive experience for me just to have a professional confirm that the way I was treated was no way to treat a child. She was actually the one who made me start to feel okay to stop trying for reconciliation.  I hope you will accept assistance such as welfare. Social safety nets are there to help!  While I won't say that I think I'll ever reach a day when I'll be able to look back at it all and laugh, I certainly do look back at the time I struck out on my own as a major turning point. The years since have felt at times a bit like a trial by fire, but it's all definitely worth it to come out the other side. 10/10 would get the fuck out of there again. 11/10 with rice.

I knew he would take to it quickly and she would be confused, which is exactly what happened. My girlfriend tied her dad for the win.  **Gloom** was cool too. It was my first time playing, but it seemed like a lot of fun. You really have to keep an eye on how many dead characters each player has, which I didn't. It seemed like getting into the story you're creating was important, which wasn't really in her family's wheelhouse. Can't wait to try it with our friends, though!

"No.  Was going to leave it like that but figured I should say more.   The main point of this game is hiding in shadows and stealing things. The stealing part is there but seems like a power up method only instead of character and interest.   The big problem with this game is the core mechanics of hiding are terrible in that light sources may or may not actually be the source of light in the room. There is one level in particular where you can be standing in  shadows  right next to a blazing fire, and another level where standing one inch further into the LIGHT actually puts you in shadows.   0/10. 1/10 with rice, but only because of the rice.",0,1419731538,Steam,9,0

"I think I can shed some light on this. My parents were divorced by the time I was 7 and separated by the time I was 6. Between the age of 7 and 18 my mother was living with women. When I was very young, I didn't entirely understand that the other women in my life were romantically involved with my mom. As I grew up, I began to understand. My feelings about the situation oscillated between acceptance and resentment at first. I was frustrated that my home life wouldn't be the same as the other kids. In my early teen years when I started being more candid about my living situation, I got teased. I stood up for myself and it no longer became an issue. Now, I'm a grown man and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. What my mother does has no reflection on me. With that being said, I think I learned a great deal of tolerance and acceptance for the homosexual community. If anything, it taught me to be more open minded about others. 8/10, 10/10 with rice.",0,1419881072,AskReddit,153,0

"Groin cramped up during my second work set of squats (first exercise of my workout), so I had to skip the next three sets. I was otherwise feeling great, due to going off my cut during the holidays and having extra energy from eating ~TDEE for the past few days. I think I could have made all the reps with no trouble, had I not hurt myself.   Unsatisfactory form with OHP. I got all the reps, but a couple of them were kind of sloppy. I could feel some discomfort in my back, as my body told me  That's enough! Your form on that last rep sucks!  It's so hard to progress!  I skipped deadlifts, due to my groin being cramped up. I did 1x3 at 60% of my normal work weight just to see how it felt, but I didn't feel like I could add weight to it or do further reps safely.  I completed all my grip work just fine. I can feel my hands getting stronger.  4/10, 6/10 with rice",0,1420071086,Fitness,2,0

"What's offensive? Stating how the title is confusing, talking down to someone because they were confused, correcting someone, talking down to someone again or making a sarcasting comment.    Also, I'd like to point out that a typographical error only covers missspelling words. So when you use the wrong word or words in the wrong order, it is not a typo.    See, the goal of a language is to convey messages, and when you don't use language correctly, the message can be interpreted in the wrong way. Then you can consider 2 options, either you point out an error someone made, which could result in them not making that same error again. Or you could not point it out, which makes sure they don't get pissed off, but they might make the same mistake again.    Then you can consider the type of the error as well. A typo isn't really a problem, the message is still clear and most of the time the person actually knows how to type the word, they merely pressed the wrong button. But using the wrong words or not using a comma when necessary, can severely distort the message, and I think there are cases where it is important to point out.    Now that you've gotten this far in my comment, I thank you for you time and whish you a happy new year. I also suspect you of trolling, if that is the case: gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 no h8.

"No.    Well, ok, maybe, possibly, millenia from now, provided we survive long enough (either from ourselves, or from world disaster) we might be smart enough and technologically advanced enough, and therefore know how to harness a lot of antimatter safely to make something approaching this thing.  But the chances are so remotely impossible that we get there, given current stats and trends, that I am confident that from a *human standpoint*, there's no freaking way.  ---  No.  The amount of antimatter that might, MIGHT, repel a thing gravitationally, would be a fair amount of mass.  We can't generate but a few atoms at best of antimatter.  You want a whole *person's* worth?  But let's say it's possible to make that much antimatter.  How are you going to contain it safely?  It *annihilates* with anything it touches, pure energy release, total destruction.  If the containment (which is going to have to be magnetic) is breached, it's game over, and not an insignificant amount of 'over'.  http://www.edwardmuller.com/right17.htm  Plug in a lot of numbers, but let's go with 200 pounds of antimatter, to 'anti-gravity' a person of similar weight.  You let that 'go', and you've released 3904 Megatons of TNT.  78 Tsar Bombas, which is worth 50 Megatons each.  13 Hurricane Katrinas, 300 Megatons each.  Nobody would let you DO that if you wanted, because of the danger.  ---  Past those, the idea of anti-gravity from antimatter is at best only a theory, so until and unless the gravitational attraction (or repulsion) is observed and measured, it's still just a theory.  It MIGHT could work, but it would be highly impractical and dangerous as hell.  0/10.    0/10 with rice.",0,1420340925,AskReddit,2,0

"Keeper: 10/10. De Gea is probably the most Solid BPL keeper that I've seen and tried so far. I haven't tried Courtois (who seems not as good when I play against him), Cech (Good against me, hard to be), Lloris (Really good imo), etc.  Defense: 8/10. Solid Defenders and They don't have high attacking workrates except Filipe Luis, which is great (I enjoy playing with a defense that doesn't push itself higher up field.).   Midfield: 8/10. Schurrle is good, you can replace Walcott with Sanchez if needed, and Ozil can be replaced on preference. Ramires is a good CDM for BPL, although Yaya is obviously one of the best, if not best person for that position.  Forwards: 9/10. You have a clinical finisher (in my opinion) in Robin van Persie, and a good striker in Balotelli. Whenever I used Balotelli, his workrates felt better than low/low and was a great, agressive striker for me!  Overall, the team in my opinion is a 9/10 (10/10 with rice). The I really don't see much flaws besides upgrading to higher rated players.",0,1420416111,FIFA,3,0

"The documentary Room 237.  This documentary takes a look at the films of Stanley Kubrick and talks about some of the theories and hidden meanings behind them.   Except the director does a half assed job of getting people to interview,  using only footage from the movies, and keeping a cohesive narrative going.   At one point,  the person talking about his theory abruptly stops talking to go take care of their kid.  This doesn't add anything to the documentary, and the director just pauses whatever video is playing in screen until the guy resumes.   Interesting premise, utter failure in execution. 1/10.  3/10 with rice.   9/10 if it was just rice.",0,1420564819,AskReddit,1,0

"**I know understand half of /r/teenagers** Good read and that helps clarify stuff! Might just write something myself then!  Cafeteria here is great, we used to have snackday only on wednesdays, wednesdays got too crowded, SNACKDAY EVERY DAY!! The other normal food is great too!  Is religion in school normal there? Over here the only religious thing actually shown is muslims not eating some meat kinds.  So in the Netherlands Middle and high school are basically the same, and you stay on the same school through both.  **School schedule**  Schooldays differ, you get a schedule every 4 months wich merges all your default ( non changeable ;_; ) classes into a week, sometimes class starts at 8.20 am, or you're lucky and you can show up at 10.25 am ( my schedule includes this one and it's heaven). Anyway, you have to deal with the schedule until you get a new one.  'Testweek'  In my school, wich is done otherwise in some other schools around here, we have what's called  een proefwerkweek  translating to 'a Testweek' Usually starts on a friday to thursday the week after getting 2 tests a day, we get a test of all our classes, excluding some like music/art etc. These test weigh 3 times as much as normal quizzes, 'testweek' is basically a mini exam 4 times a year ( often pulling half-nighters already )  **Class stays together**  Also worth mentioning is our class itself; When going to this school you get introduced to **your class**, you stay with this class for 2 years and the split up a bit, im in year 2 of middle school right now and this year we chose one of three art-classes: Music/Acting/Art When these classes come once a week, our normal class splits up into 3 classes and merges with another split up class, thus making one art class. 3rd or 4th year most of us go different ways, choosing either language specialized or others.  **Grade levels**  We have the standard EU grading program; 1/10 (8/10 with rice)  A 10 always means you got 0 mistakes in the whole test/quizz/etc.  9 is Very good!  8 is pretty well  7 is nice  6 is meh  and a 5,5 is **minimum** anything below that means you 'failed' Grading also goes between numbers, 8,1-8,7 etc. Anything 0,5 or gets rounded **up** to e.g. a  1  I wrote a bit.

"My girlfriend and I met during Freshman Orientation at our university (she was the freshman, I was a sophomore trying to be social with the possibility of hooking up with any of the newcomers. Yeah I was a toolbag...) and we met by playing a popular icebreaker game called Ninja. The object of the game is to hit your opponent's hands in order to knock them out of the game. Well, that's where we met. Afterwards, we ended up going to the same classes together since we were both involved in the same major (Computer Graphics). Then after a year of being good friends, I came to the realization that I may be only just her friend and nothing else.  I ignored her super duper subtle advances towards me (random tickling, over excited greetings, etc.). I just thought she was a genuinely nice person with a wonderful personality. We would hang out in my room, in the computer labs, and anywhere else we could be seen in public. This girl was not ticklish by any means (except by her sister, her dad, and a few others could  kinda  tickle her). One night, I noticed I was able to tickle her, but only in a certain spot. I noticed that this was kind of weird. Is she only ticklish to those whom she becomes emotionally attached to? IDK, just go with it.  Well, things got pretty intimate one night together. We did everything BUT kiss that night. I was too afraid to lose what relationship we already had together, so instead of making a move, I ASKED if I could kiss her. I still cringe at the thought of doing this. She turned me down because of the fact that she was being on/off with some other guy, and she didn't want to feel like a slut. That was understandable, I guess... until the next night.  The next night, after myself, her, and our mutual friends had finished playing card and board games all night, we all dispersed except for me and her. I asked her what she wanted to do now, and she suggested a movie at my place. Keep in mind I accepted my friendzone fate from the night before, so I thought nothing of it. We went in to my room, turned on The Incredibles (I had not seen it at the time), and then she does one of her tickle flirting advances again. I retort by tickling back, and that is when the leg gets hiked over my body. How would one react to that? Not the way I did. I sat there staring at her, with her staring at me, waiting for one of us to make the next move. This went on for at least 20 minutes until I verbally said  Fuck it.  And the magical first kiss began.  We are still happily together today, playing video games with each other, encouraging each other to perform better with our artwork, talking about big plans for the future, and we still recreate that first awkward kiss sometimes just for that awesome nostalgic feeling.   No ragrets! 8/10 would do it again, 9/10 with rice.",0,1420662338,AskReddit,2,0

"UPDATE 2 AND WILL CONTINUE IF ANYBODY CARES.  **Sipping a beer at the counter while talking with my best friend.**  Me: I am never visiting this town again, I swear. Scarred for life, bro, scarred for life.   Friend: Why? What happened there?  ME: Well, this is the story...  Morning. 2 P.M. I'm still lying in my bed, half asleep. As I turn around I get almost blind by the sunlight from the window.  Fuck, why do I always forget to close my curtains.  I realize it is already a time normal people are wide awake and have been working for hours now. Hey, don't blame me, I'm jobless, why should I care? Anyway, I'm rolling around like a half dead fish trying to get up but am too tired from all the sleeping. I barely open my eyes and look at my phone. Notification light is turned on. Huh, I guess somebody cares about me. I grab the phone and see 1 unseen e-mail. I open it.  What is this?  With still a blurry sight I read the header:  Congratulations, you are a winner! .  Ah, fuck that, another shitty fake ad. Spam filter, you had one job! One job! . I put the phone down and decide to rest from the unnecesary physical activity. An hour later and I feel my stomach starts aching. Fuck, I haven't eaten anything. I finally get up and look at the watch.  Holy shit, 3 P.M. really?!!  I keep muttering how I've lost half a day that could be used doing unproductive shit. After I leave bathroom and head to the kitchen a phone rings.  What?  I raise my hand up and look at the caller id. Yes, it's basicly glued to my hand the whole day, I bring it anywhere, even in the shower. God bless people who invented water proof phones, they saved my life. Literally. Anyway, I don't recognize the caller but I answer anyway.  Me:  Hello?   Caller:  Herro, is this a mista Barr?    Me:  Who is this?   Caller:  This is mista Chan from Reddit headquaaatas.   Me:  ...What do you need?   Caller:  Congratureizon mista ...  Me:  For what?   Caller:  You win da main prize! Three days in a city of Reddit!   Me:  What.   Caller:  Uhh maybe you do not remember good, but you entered the competition organized by Reddit inc. and your ticket was serected for a winning trip!   Me:  Huh, would you look at that... I don't remember jack shit but I guess I was a part of it, I often participate wherever I can get something... Free shit is a good shit, right?   Caller:  Right. Your boat will wait for you today at the closest dock at 5 o'clock.   Me:  Today?!!   Caller:  We are eagerry awaiting you mista Barr!   Call ended.  I just stay there without moving for a minute. Then I look at the time.  3:56 holy fu*k. I NEED TO GET READY!  After taking everything I'll need for the next three days and nearly killing myself during the process I manage to get to the boat in time. It was stationed practicly in the middle of nowhere and that is kind of weird, but whatever. THE TRIP IS FREE.  After about an hour of sailing we get to the small island. It looks glorious. I get nearly blind again from the number or lights on the streets. That is how glorious it looks. I get out and in front of me there are the main giant doors of the city. Two fine gentlemen with fedoras, dressed full in black with katanas in their hands stand on the both sides of the gates. They let me in. On the other side some shady guy stops me.  Guy: Do you brought some memes with you bro?  Me:  What the fuck are you talking about?   Guy:  That is a bad start of your stay here.   Man, I think I can already see this is going to be very interesting trip.    I am soon greeted by a guy who represents himself as mr.Chan.  Me: Oh, you must be mister Chan from the phone call, right?  Chan: Right mista. Come, ret me show you around.  We are walking trough the main street. Boy it's long and wide, almost like yo momma. Anyway, at the end of the street there is a large main square. They call it a  Front square . There are a lot of people here, everybody is laughing and dancing, there are news reporters everywhere, I can see crowd surrounding some guys... They must be some kind of stars here. We jump into a cab and mr.Chan tells me he'll show me around the city museum but first he'll leave me at some restaurant to eat something. Dude I'm hungry as f. We stop at the huuuge building. I read the sign:  Food . Well f me, I think it's a genius name. Straight to the point. Chan grabs my hand and pulls me with himself. I can already see my mouth watering. But, HEY!   Me:  Uh, mister, why did we turn around? The entrance is right HERE?!   Chan:  I'm sorry mista, but our agency paid for your food elsewhere .  Me:  Oh well... It's still free right? So, it's good with me haha!   Chan: Right.   We stop at the most shittiest little houss I've ever seen in my life. Man, this place is a wreck. And the smell... Oh Goood, oh GOD please tell me this is a joke!  Chan: don't worry mista, it is smelly jusr on the outside. Come!   We enter and I the waiter points to my seat. But...  Me:  Wha... who's that kid? Why is he sitting at my table?   Waiter:  We're sorry, all the other tables are full at the moment, be assured you will be just fine and that boy won't bother you.  Me: ...Fiiine...   I sit and greet the kid.  Kid:  Mister, can you help me decide what food should I buy for my tomorrows birthday party for myself?   Me: Uh... What?  That was random.  Uh, I guess an old shoe with a mayo would be a nice meal for you heh.   I try not to chuckle.  Kid: Thank you for your suggestion.   My meal is coming, I can smell it. The waiter opens the pot.  Me: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? I AIN'T GONNA EAT THAT!   Waiter:  Oh, but this is  Shittyfoodporn's  finest meal!  This is a fucking chicken soup with gummy bears inside. I am in pure shock.  Waiter:  We even put a special ingridienf - Mt. Dew! .  Word cannot find their way out from my mouths. Another waiter comes.  Kid:  Oooh this must be for me!   He opens the cover and is greeted with blue scrambled eggs and something ghat looked like microwaved bull's dick.  Me(with disgusted look on my face): ... You... you ain't gonna eat that... Right?... Right?   Kid:  Why not? And I'll get a shitton of gold for it!   Me: What? Gold?   Kid: And look! To be honest, I would say it tastes for 2/10, BUT! I get some rice in my pocket! Nowww watch... Uh huuuh... I put the rice ALL over it and now... Let's see... Munch munch munch...  It's 6/10 with rice!   I am trying not to puke.  I run outside of the shitstaurant and search for a cab. Mr. Chan is already waiting for me.   Chan:  How was your runch, sir?   Me:  Go fuck yourself :  Chan:  Very well then.   Ok, this is the part which I would rather never ever mention again. We arrive at the Reddit's museum of Great Users. There is all kinds of shit inside, and I see some statues of  Users with the most karma's , whatever that means. Mr.Chan escorts me to some hotel and I get a decent room this time. Nothing much happens anymore that day.   Day 2:   I wake up and decide to go by myself and search for some interesting places around the city. In front of the hotel there is a large park. I can see a lot of people with their pets there. I look at the street's name on the wall.   Aww ... I don't even bother anymore. I move across the street and head to some bench to rest a little and enjoy the view.    Dude, those guys were completely nuts! They all danced together, laughed, smoked some joint and petted their pets. You could hear awwwing from everywhere. I found it creepy as fck and walked away.   Anyway, I continue walking. I see some building on my left called  Getmotivated . I enter to see what's going on. It turns out there are just some lame teenagers sitting in circles and passing some potraits and landscapes between themselves, with quotes slapped on them and all that shit.  Me:  Hey guys, this is all BULLSHIT. Do you hear me? Stop wasting your time and go do something PRODUCTIVE  Lol I know, I am the last one who should be saying something like that but whatever.  Some girl turns her head and looks at me, gets up and yells.  Girl:  I AM 14 AND THIS IS DEEP, OK?!! .  Fine with me, why do I even care!  After quite some walking and finding nothing particularly interesting I call a cab and tell the driver to drive me around and show me some interesting places. We are driving for some time and I notice huge fun park through the window and tell him to stop there. I get out and head to the park. It's called  Funny . Well let me tell you something. This place was the most unfunniest place I have ever been to. I rage quited the fun ride and walked away. I am just walking, minding my own business when some fat kid jump rights in front of me and whispers to me.  Fat kid:  Mister, can you please tell me I'm fat? And please tell it loud so everybody can hear it.   Me:  Seriously, what's wrong with you kids... Ok. GET OFF MY WAY YOU FATTY FATTY BOY!   Fat kid:  THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUR MOTHER SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT!   He proceeds to make some lame street sign with his short fat fingers and runs away, followed by some skinny kid with a camera, yelling at him  That was SO thug bro! We will get tons of karma!   Seriously, what the fuck is up with that  karma  here, huh?   ------------ Still just a beggining, hell I might post it later as a whole story for some critical feedback. Updates coming soon.  ------------------- This is just starting, but I'll post it now because I won't be able to continue writing. I hope somebody will read it and like it.  EDIT HOLY SHIT 3 UPVOTES. Ok I'll finish the story when I get home. The fun part didn't even come yet.",0,1420738756,WritingPrompts,10,0

"It was my 4th visit. My friend Dan had been living here for over a year now and kept bragging how mankind had finally created a true democratic society. He wanted me to move in but I remained skeptical. These new Web-Towns we’re emerging all over the world but I still had a bitter taste in my mouth from that three months experience in Los Google.  Having to share all my private life with city officials every time I needed to take a piss wasn’t my definition of ‘’enhanced services’’.  ‘’Stop looking so grim, New Reddit is nothing like that shit hole you tried last year.’’ Dan said as we reached our destination.  I looked at the large marble arch in front of us, r/AskReddit was carved in it.  ‘’What’s so special about this place?’’ I replied.  ‘’I’m telling you man, this neighborhood will blow your mind. Anything you could possibly wonder, someone here will be able to answer it.’’ He said with such enthusiasm that I finally smiled.  We started walking around but I felt like such a tourist. The place looked like a giant fair. Everywhere we went, someone was standing on a little stage with a sign in his hands. What movie has the worst ending? What is career suicide in your industry? What sentence do you know that can start an internet war?  I couldn’t understand why these questions mattered to anyone but the crowd seemed to love it. Hundreds of them gathered around each stage, shouting their answers.  ‘’Chewing gum!’’  ‘’Oranges!’’  ‘’Pancakes!’’  I must have been pretty hungry. Out of everything being yelled around us, food caught my attention. This Asian kid was sitting at a table, in the center of a stage. To his left, the biggest pot of rice I’d seen in my life. To his right, a bunch of random food people gave him.  Was this some sort of social experiment? This kid was asking his fellow citizen for disgusting food ideas to eat over rice and rating it on a scale of 1 to 10. It was so silly but oddly entertaining. I found myself watching him for over thirty minutes while he tested Nutella, Jelly beans and Spaghetti on top of rice.  ‘’C’mon buddy, there’s plenty more stuff I want to show you today’’ Dan said while dragging me away from this hypnotizing spectacle.   We resumed our walk, while he continued to sing the praise of New Reddit. It was just a few blocks later that we both stopped again but… not because of a stage act this time.   A gorgeous blond girl in high heels, wearing the shortest of skirts and a slim white shirt was coming our way. ‘I love New Reddit’ the shirt said. How clever.  ‘’Damn man look at her, she’s a 9!’’ he said in awe.  I couldn't help it.  ‘’10/10 with rice’’",0,1420742411,WritingPrompts,6,0

"Sorry I'm late to the party, but it took me a full day to contemplate the implications of this scenario, but this is the conclusion I've come to:  The clairvoyant can see the future, but he is bound to that future. As soon as he sees what his moves will be, he is forced to follow through with those moves. He is unable to differ from what he sees because if he did, the new outcome is what he would've seen in the beginning. This is where the telepath gains the upper hand. The telepath is able to see all of the clairvoyant's moves, but is not bound by the vision of the future changing to accommodate his changes. The telepath is free to make whatever move best counters the clairvoyant. The clairvoyant would see the telepath counter every move and not be able to stop it. For this reason, the outcome is as follows:  Telepath wins 10/10.  12/10 with rice.",0,1420749176,whowouldwin,2,0

"Initially bumped into each other at a local after event party, during which she tried to hand me a whiskey and Coke (telling me the story behind getting a whiskey and Coke instead of whiskey and Club Soda), and I kept on listening to her talk for a while (we agreed that too much money goes into sports for US colleges), and I said we should get a pedicure together.  She agreed, we exchanged numbers, and then I tried all night to get her to come to my friend's house for the after-after-party-party.  She proceeded to avoid me for a while, then called me back as I was heading to a house party. I said we could work out the details of going to a pedicure the next day, as I was about to be at a party.   About 20 minutes into the party, she showed up!  She then managed to chime in that she had a degree in Classical Studies, and I was basically hooked. I managed to get her to come to dinner the following Friday (which she had tried, so hard, to get her friend to come to while we discussed it *at* the party), and we... well, we just haven't stopped being around each other since.  11/10 without a doubt the best instance of persistence I've ever gone after.  13/10 with rice (seeing as she loves it, too!)",0,1420756631,AskReddit,1,0

"Vic is great, if you're either rich, or willing to live cheaply. If you want a comfortable, middle-class existence you're probably going to have to move out to the deep burbs. Victoria's got a bit of  beauty tax  going on, which means salaries are lower, and costs are higher.   But, upside... great downtown community. Fantastic natural beauty minutes away by car (or even walk. Most placed in lower Saanich are a 5-25 minute walk straight to the ocean!) Thriving hipster scene, if you're into that kind of thing.  There's a lot of complaining about the homeless situation, and it's true. I used to get approached ~5 times a walk through downtown. Way more than I've been approached in Toronto or Van. But spend a little time downtown and you get to know all the homeless people. Not necessarily in a good way, but it's a small enough town that you just get to know them all and their stories. Who else remembers when inflation drove quarter lady to become fifty-cent lady? Dude whose father is a band leader in Alberta and he just needs a hotel for a night? Guy who locked his keys in his car and just needs bus fare? Guy in a wheel chair by Bastion square whose bum leg seems mysteriously inconsistent...  Almost never snows. Sticks to the ground once every few years. Gorgeous summers. Best in Canada by far. 18-25 every day with no rain for months. Winters get a bit dreary but less rainy than Van or Seattle. Not the Garden of Eden everywhere - a lot of the housing and development is downright ugly, and  nature  is sort of pushed to the fringes. But that's the same anywhere. The city government is pretty shit, but that's the same anywhere too.   All in all, great place to live. 8/10   11/10 with rice.",0,1420776099,VictoriaBC,6,0

"I'm having a hard time telling if you're trolling me here.  Obviously I wasn't arguing the healthiness of McDonald's. I'm arguing that something that doesn't match up with your opinion (in this case, Fathead) doesn't automatically mean that it's a paid for piece by a giant corporation. That's 'crisis actor' conspiracy theorist level logic, and it's retarded. Reread your [original comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/2rxr43/happy_meals_and_books_yayy/cnkys0k) and you can see where the argument you put forth is purely one saying that it's a sponsored piece.   Fathead itself doesn't even argue the healthiness of McDonald's, it merely shows that Spurlock's  documentary  used flawed methods and in some cases, with the data given to us BY THE MOVIE, outright lied.  As an aside, McDonald's IS trying to make things healthier, but only because there's been a larger market and consumer push for them. It's not purely good intentions, it's primarily profit driven.

"I rarely was injured when I was a kid, and only lost one (extremely lopsided and unfair fight,  I was 14 vs his 18, and they had a bat), but MCMAPs simply wasn't direct enough for me, it was more about blocks, falls, and grapples than strikes, I didn't really like it.  PFT is the Physical Fitness Test, Sit Ups, Pull ups, and the run.  My enlistment was rather odd. I signed up for tanks, went to Parris Island for Recruit Training, then Knox to be trained for tanks, and was shipped to a tank unit.. That had just had their tanks taken away and told they were converting to Infantry. So I got sent to ITB (Infantry Training Battalion). Only to find out when I got back that the unit needed more Combat Radiomen, the guys with the radios on their backs and the telephone handsets you see in movies.  So I volunteered for that, and then got sent to 29 Palms for MCCES (Marine Corps Communication Electronics School).. And then some other stuff happened and then it was time for me to get out, contract up, decided not to re-enlist.  So I spent four years being trained, evaluated, granted clearance, and figuring out who I was and what responsibility and maturity meant, and then got out, 9/10, 10/10 with rice, would do again (if I was reliving my life).",0,1421038883,ThePhenomenon,3,0

"Not OP, but I've had one since the moment they became available.  They did a pretty good job with it. The parts are well made, nice clean lines. Finish is smooth and consistent. It's very comfortable in the hand. There are a few issues though. If you pinch the back part of the handle it binds up, and the rear lock doesn't work very well, and sticks a lot. But normal opening and closing is nice and smooth, it does do it's thing and  lock  open as long as you're holding it, and I haven't had a reason to use the rear lock in EDC situations.   Of course the blade is only AUS-8 (which I kinda hate), I would have gladly shelled out a bit more for 8Cr13MoV or even 154CM. Like everything I've owned in AUS-8, it's developed a light speckling of rust.   Overall I'd have to give it an 8/10 (Maybe 9/10 with rice).",0,1421112483,knifeclub,2,0

"Woo! So I just ate! Here is my synopsis.   I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with no lettuce of tomato. The onions were kinda meh, some really tough pieces from the outer part of the onion were used that I had to pull off.   Pickles, ketchup, and mayo, were all in the direct center of the burger so the edges weren't covered but that is typical of all fast food so whatever.   The patty was very good, not too greasy but also not dry and tough. Good flavor but I still prefer the flavor of BK's beef.   The bacon was exceptional. Not as much bacon as I would hope but the bacon's taste was far better than most fast food bacon.   The bread was also very high quality. Nicely toasted on the insides and not covered in grease like a Wendy's burger.   The fries were a let down. Kinda dry but not crispy either. Fries usually aren't my thing though so it isn't that big of a deal for me.    Overall I'd give it a 7/10 fast food quality.

"check your facts.  IOS scans are indeed better than taking impressions, which incidentally two points are at play: impressions often times have voids and bubbles and lead to unsealed margins or poor fits. in-office milling units often are limited to 3-axis movement which all by itself constricts and constrains the dentist prep. patterson outright LIES to the dentist about the cost of manufacturing but i won't go into that here. when dentists don't want to be told how to prep they find out that these in-office units just can't make their crowns fit and often break down. milled units such as zirconia and emax (if you want milled emax) are often best left to the far FAR more expensive and capable lab milling units. these often can perform full 5 axis motion and resolve into single micron accuracy (compared to in office units nearing 100um accuracy), which directly translates to more precise and better overall fits. 10/10 from lab, 11/10 with rice.  now, triple trays leave the bite open. every. time. every. single. time. patients who are numb VERY often cannot get into CO, and think they are fully closed when in fact they are so droopy from numbing agent they are several mm open on one side. funny thing that nerve business. the whole muscle memory thing doesnt exist for the jaw. too bad.  triple trays are the bane of every lab; when you have a free end bridge, you take one (you arent supposed to) and leave 0 ability to find a bite with adjacent 2 teeth. they were designed to be used when you don't want to spend 30$ on an impression. not for making c+b.  anyone who uses triple trays should be shot.  offices that use algenate often let  subordinates  take impressions, meaning there is 0 ability to quality control. any lab that pours algenates should be a lab in a basement that caters only to the upstairs doc. if the trays go out accross town they will warp en route. will, not may. will. this is the sign of a bad practice.  impressions taken with algenate are suitable for two things; making custom trays and spreading bloody hazards. every denture when it is made by amateurs begins with an algenate and custom tray. those with experience and who know what they are doing don't send this to a lab to be done, but do it themselves. theres a name given to these people, theyre called Denturists, they kinda work everywhere instead of a primary lab, and only call upon labs when they need custom titanium frames. but i'm going on a tangent.  i may be pessimistic, you may be correct, but labs do care about quality; because the more work goes out the door *and doesnt come back for remake because of any of the reasons above* the better. slow payer or not, the lowest remake factor wins.  btw, IOS should be baseline used for diagnostic impressions, because the more comfortable the patient is while you are diagnosing, the easier it is to say you need to cause discomfort.  now, as far as milled restorations go emax is not its best when milled. it is 10% better flexuarally, and much easier to shade when its pressed. also the cost is far lower to produce by press.",0,1421292040,Dentistry,2,0

"You don't need any extra CPU power nowadays for streaming games due to the fact you have Shadowplay with an nvidia card. What will you need to use it for for school? Any raw computing power will rather be hampered by the lack of RAM than CPU speed, of which you have 'only' 8GB (which is enough for now, you can always add extra when it gets cheaper and more useful down the line).  Also you can chuck out the DVD drive. Apart from installing, which you will do from USB now because you're going to save on the windows disk as well, you will never use it.  -$100 CPU   -$80 windows   - $20 drive _______________ $200 saved  Also I'm unsure about the current motherboards on the market, but I see it's an SLI motherboard. As you are not running an SLI setup right off the bat, you will never because it will be a better cost-benefit down the line to sell your old card and buy a new generation graphics card regardless.

"Editing as I go.  Darkmoon Sage is *insane!* Seriously. That should be a Legendary minion. Knowing what you will draw is invaluable in a card game. Add a y after a and before g and replace Darkmoon with Fortune Teller, and boom: Fortune Teller Sayge, brand new, almost certainly auto-include Legendary minion.  For Blue Dragonspawn, I'd make the text read:  Immune to indirect damage.  That should do exactly what you want it to do while making easier to understand.  Magma Alchemist is also quite strong. Include it in a deck, and you'll be including 2/3 Minions instead of 3/2 ones. Then it's pretty much just a 3 mana 3/3, Battlecry give a minion +2/+1 and trigger Enrage. I'd say it should cost five mana, or four at the very least.  Warriors would absolutely love Agamaggan, no doubt about it.  ~~Ruby Drake obsoletes Chillwind Yeti. Should cost more, five at minimum, I'd say.~~ Edit: I misread this, and thought that it swapped the health and attack of another minion, not exchange it like Vol'jin does.  Simpler text for Neferset Guardian: Silence any minion damaged by this minion.  Looking at Obsidian and Bronze drake as 4/4s for 5, why not make Ruby Drake a 4/4 for 5 as well? That way we have a bunch of 'evenly' matched dragons that don't have too much of an advantage over one another.  Crystal Colossus Dream:  - Turn 4, with only two cards in hand: Coin into Crystal Colossus. - Turn 5: Draw and play Fel Reaver. - Turn 6: Draw and play Anima Golem.  - Turn 7: Draw and play Sea Giant. - Turn 8: Draw and play Ragnaros. - Turn 9: Draw and play Alexstrasza.  Gr8 m8 I r8 8/8. ^^^With ^^^an ^^^extra ^^^1/1 ^^^tossed ^^^in ^^^there.  **Vindicator** Maraad.  Avenger's Shield is just Arcane Missile for more mana and one extra damage.

"My imagination?  Okay so lets start this. The newfriend, lets call him Bill, now Bill heard about this strange Olive guy. And Bill was a big fan of Olives, he liked to put them on almost everything he ate, except rice - he rated it a 3/10 with rice but that's beside the point. So Bill starts hearing more about this Olive guy and he's ~~sexually~~ interested. So he joins CivCraft to try and see him, because I mean he loves Olives in real life he probably will move them in a video game too. So when he gets to Tel Aviv he hears the guy talking in chat.  At this point Bill is fucking sweating madly, because he's about to actually meet this Olive guy that's been filling his dreams recently. So he asks the guy where he's at and Olive responds that he's over by a chicken piano. While Bill briefly questions the legality of such a thing, he pushes the thought out because if the Olive guy thinks its good, then it has to be.  When Bill finally gets to the place he was talking about, he's in fucking abject horror. This Olive guy, the man he'd been dreaming and fantasizing about for a solid week now.  **HE WASN'T A FUCKING OLIVE.   HE WAS A JEW.**  So Bill is obviously very distraught, he briefly questions suicide - but no! Bill knows exactly what he's going to do.  *He's going to wreck this fuckers elegos.*  That's right, but he couldn't let the imposter know it was him. So Bill goes around the land trying to find the nearest soul other than that filthy imposter. Eventually he finds himself in a place called New Leningrad, and some guy named blowtheball or something like that was in the city. So Bill tells blowtheball that this place called Tel Aviv,   IT HATES HIM.  AND HIS CITY.  After saying this, Bill is pretty sure that this blowtheball guy is about to call up his mates and kick the olive imposter's elegos TO. THE. FUCKING. GROUND.  Content with himself, Bill walks back somewhere near Tel Aviv, to a place he's pretty sure won't be reached by the sea of lava that will soon coat the entire area, and logs off.  I'm pretty sure that's more or less how the situation went.",0,1421465547,Civcraft,3,0

"Ok, here's my personal story about this babe called, PRS SE Custom 24.  I met her online, she was hot, grey/black finish, perfect body-style, splash of a les paul-rounded, body with a hint of fender horns.   Damn how I wanted her. Many days a week I found myself browsing her guitar center profile. Watched videos of her voice tone over, and over, I was obsessed.  Some fortunately, un-fortunate, events unfolded and fate decided to give me my dream girl. So, she traveled faaaar and wide from Korea in a small box! Right to my home town, to finally arrive on my front porch.   But there's this sayin,  the look on the cake, it ain't always the taste...   Ok, ok, I'll stop with the crazy imagery. but so I finally opened the guitar, plugged it into my stack, jammed away and first thing that hit me was  holy damn this guitars intonation is awful  I had to have a close friend set it up for me. the pups were just eh, I replaced them with Led Zeps  Whole Lotta Humbucker  set and it have the guitar a MUCH brighter voice. The only thing is the resonance in the neck doesn't give the notes very much sustain. I can't hold my notes out very long before they have to be picked again.

"Well okay so I went to Homecoming with a girl as her date (we'll just call her Presley) and we went with a group of 12 people. I was a freshman in HS so I was 14 I'm pretty sure. I told the girl a week or so before the dance that I liked her but she said she wanted to go as friends which I completely understood. We all went out to dinner first and then once we got to the dance Presley said she wanted to get a couple's picture so I obliged. Then while we were waiting in line out of the blue she started holding my hand   As a kid who had never A: Held Hands with a girl before and B: never kissed a girl before my heart honestly fluttered. I kinda figured after that she wanted to be a little more than friends.  We ended up kissing later that night while we were dancing and to anyone else that has had their first kiss with someone they really liked you know the feeling.   Anyhow we dated for a little while after and it turns out that she was a psychopathic bitch and we broke up.   8/10 would do again, 10/10 with rice",0,1421686110,AskReddit,1,0

"This game gets crazier by the day. I spent all day yesterday playing my first game as Byzantine emperor. Finally, my third son's second son got the cruel trait. I've got a prison full of people who have way too many balls and eyes. I whacked everybody between me and cruelty boy. Finally my first character dies at 82. First thing I do is go to the intrigue tab with palpitant heart only to find I still can't do it. WTF!  I've invested 9 hours waiting to smell the blood on the cold stone floor of my oubliette. So I google that shit up. Turns out our lord Gaben and his colleagues at Paradox charge an extra $6 for Legacy of Rome completely unbeknownst to me.  Then I looked at my life. I'm almost 42, I called in sick to work because my power was out all day Sunday (wind storm)  and I really wanted to play some CK2.  My laptop cooked my thighs all day. My eyes hurt. And I murdered no fewer than 9 sons and grandchildren. Ten with the bastard. By this time, I was getting to like it and wife number two had to go so I could marry a  wicked  lustful impaler. I was trying to create an entire dynasty of little sickos who could abide neither sight no fertility in their captives.  11/10 with rice.

"To be honest i dont see the problem with private servers providing that the characters are locked to how they are now. No server hoping type stuff. Seperate characters per server.      If someone wants to play in a private group on a private server by all means but do not allow them to loot up and join the server i play on with all there risk free loot.      These streamers getting  promotional  servers i see as a GREAT PR event for the game. Also if you wanted a 24 hour free trial style server that could go down great since for an example,      Lirik (Just going by memory not who i watch) could do a live stream event with his veiwers and give away a 24 hour access code to a private server allowing anyone that dose not own the game a chance to play it with his favorite streamer boosting the chance of actually buying in to EA.      Sorry for the bad spelling and grammar i'm very ill and tired.      Love the game and so far i rate it 10/10 with rice      EDIT: If this is a legit idea try not to leave out the smaller guys on twitch maybe have a requirement of say 500 viewers average to gain access to these free trial servers. Or merge smaller streamers together so say the bottom 3 streamers get 10 keys each but share the same server. Where as top end streams like lirik would get a whole server to themselves due to the number of viewers that could play at any one time.      Maybe adjust it as they fill up as i would imagine smaller streamers would get an influx of viewers due to the  free trial  key event.",0,1421965342,h1z1,-1,0

"&gt;Especially if they go after Japan's culture directly.  They won't. Progressives are excellent at mental gymnastics. They'll carve out an exception for the Japanese by talking exclusively about the  cultural appropriation  committed by Western fans. And particularly the male fans who lack social skills.  (Isn't it weird how that one group is responsible for all the problems in the world? /s)  Anyway. Japanese companies will still be forced to respond since they'd like to avoid having their products stigmatized in Western markets. And since the Japanese don't speak SJW, I expect them to speak past each other with hilarious results.  As someone who isn't a fan of anime, I'll be sure to bring the popcorn.

"Well, technically since his character always remains centered in the screen, he himself is the actually playing as the camera which is affixed to point at the character, who is making walking movements. We know he isn't directly attached to the world because of the many instances of 'floating' and clipping so we can safely assume that the world moves beneath the player.  On the other hand since there can be multiple players in the game and the world can't be moving beneath all of them in the same direction at the same time, we can assume that the player itself is floating around the world whilst making walking movements.

"Mah, se Reddit diventasse trendy penso che il suo livello scadrebbe parecchio, anche se magari non necessariamente nella stessa maniera in cui scadono altre community su internet: la feccia si adatta alla community che trova. Su Reddit ad esempio c'è un maggiore controllo riguardo nei confronti di grammatica/ortografia e sintassi, però poi ci sono i karmawhore e i circlejerkers che a me danno quasi più fastidio di quelli che commentano e postano a cazzo su Facebook.  Basta che confronti un qualunque subreddit grande ad uno piccolo: ognuno ha i suoi drama interni, ma in quelli piccoli si sta decisamente meglio. Per farti un esempio, i commenti in /r/AskReddit sono una cosa illeggibile: ci sono storie che sono così finte che fanno male agli occhi, ma che sono confezionate in maniera tale da riscuotere un successo enorme (es. tutti gli uomini col pugno di ferro e la morale incorruttibile che non perdonano mai chi tradisce la loro fiducia... oppure tutti i classici circlejerk tipo Comcast etc). Poi ci sono quei commenti che ripetono all'infinito tormentoni che fanno ridere per un po' (se inseriti nel contesto giusto) ma che alle lunghe snervano- es. Albert Einstein wicked smaht, x/10 with rice...  Su /r/italy alla fin dei conti tutti conoscono tutti, e si riescono ad avere discussioni costruttive fra posizioni molto diverse (non sempre, però qua posso avere un'opinione minoritaria su temi molto importanti senza venire downvotato a cazzo)",0,1422205447,italy,8,0

"I used to live on 28th between 24th and 23rd. It was pretty fantastic, and I would still be there were it not for some shady circumstances surrounding my  verbal  lease agreement and 90+ year old land lady who moved back in to the building, brought bed bugs and nearly burned the building down a few times...   Anyway, the good: la vita mia pizza and new good one Chinese on 24th obviate the need for seamless if you want pizza or Chinese. Both places are top notch. Same goes for Othello's deli, which is a great 24 hour drunk food option. The Astoria Park Liquor store is family owned and fantastic as well. Even though I'm a mile away and have 20 other liquor stores closer, those guys still get my business. The  real  beer garden is so close it's dangerous, Astoria park is only 3/10ths of a mile away, and you are in that sweet spot from the subway where you can't really hear it but are only a 5 minute walk to either Ditmars or Astoria blvd (protip if you have a long commute, go to Ditmars for a guaranteed seat, even during rush hour). 28th was one of a few blocks in the area that didn't lose power for more than a couple hours after hurricane Sandy. I have no idea why but I sure wasn't complaining! Finally, 23rd ave over there is phenomenal, from the new, like the Bonnie and the nyc bagel coffee house to the old(er), like zorbas, tellys and the coffee pot.  The bad: on street parking is better than most of Astoria, but it still sucks if you're trying to find alternate side after 5pm on Sunday or Monday nights. There is (or was) a very sketchy, very douchy house about 5 buildings north of 24th, that kept parking their suv on the sidewalk, and once tried to start a fight with me for literally no reason other than I walked past one of them. My apartment was attempted to be broken into 3 years ago, and my neighbor got his apartment ransacked in the same event, but the 114th did their jobs (they seem to get a bad rap, but I've only had one bad experience with them) and caught the guy.  Overall, I give the area a 10/10. 11/10 with rice.",0,1422248106,astoria,2,0

"**Abuse - noun - Ah-boose:**  Essentially abuse is what happens when someone is a relationship mistreats someone else (friendship, coworker, subordinate, partner). You can't abuse someone over the internet, in my mind. That's what harassment is.  **Harassment - noun - Her-Azz-mint:** When someone gives someone repeated contact against the contactee's will. It is primarily exists in a negative context. Spam also counts.  Example of polite discourse: Anita, I can't help but discount your findings as pseudo-scientific. Your characterization of men is hate-mongering.  Example of Harassment: Anita, you fucking kike Pig-sow. You feminazi bitch. Go strangle yourself with your plaid.   **SJW (Social Justice Warrior) - Noun - Es-Jayh-UU:** I find the term a bit polarizing. But I find it synonymous with liberal authoritarianism. These are people that want change, and are willing to hate mob, shame, and bully people into, with a lack of healthy discourse. I apply this term conservatively.  **MRA (Men's Rights Activist) - Noun - Ehm-ARRR!-Aye:**  These are men and women that work toward alleviating over-conviction of males, men's custody rights, raising male sexual assault awareness, etc. These aren't anti-feminists, or red-pillers, or channers.   **Misogyny - Overused Noun - Muh-Soggy-Knees:** An attempt to victimize a woman because she's a woman. This isn't criticism, this isn't even reactionary vitriol to someone you disagree with. It has to be gender based victimization.  Example of Vitriol: You're a fucking idiot, your ideas lack any semblance of realistic thought.  Example of Misogyny: Women do not deserve X because of their gender.   **Seal-Lioning - Verb - Arf-Arf:** I had to look this term up. Its when people are trying to get someone to back up their claims. I don't think someone should be expected to defend their opinions constantly, but that if they are willing to state something without backing it up, they either need to endeavor to elaborate. If they are not willing, people shouldn't spam them with  invitations for pleasant discourse,  just mark them down as an ideologue that spews unsubstantiated claims.  **Rape/Death Threat - Noun - Gr8 B8 M8, I r8 8/8:** A fucking threat on someone's life or a threat to force them into some kind of sexual intercourse. Here's the difference between an actionable threat and an empty one.  Empty:  I'll fucking kill you fag, why don't you go off and die.    Credible/Actionable:  I know you live at 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I am coming, I will gut you like a fish Mr. Sherman.   The difference between the latter and the former is that the former is just noise and hate that can be easily avoided and ignored. All manor of internet-goers realize this pretty early. I have been on the receiving on the internet death threats dozens of times. But it's ridiculous to call them anything other than negative noise.  **Hate Group - Noun - Nothing clever this time:** People that rally around the idea that some group needs to be defeated or are lesser. They are extremists that hate people for bigoted reasons. (Black, White, Yellow, Brown, Women, Jew, Muslim, etc). Misogynists are part of a hate group. Misandrists are a hate group. Hating people is pretty base emotion, and hating them for such bigoted reasons is what makes a hate group.  I think I've not colored either group unfairly.

"I had this ex, and well, we REALLY liked to drink. We would do all of our homework together, then go get super fucking loaded and went back to my place where we continued drinking with my roommates. After we were sufficiently drunk of our asses, we went to my room and the clothes came off which is where she stopped me and said  wait let's do something fun   So i went, naked, into the kitchen and grabbed my roommates bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup. I threw her on the bed and proceeded to coat her in it. Not in sexy amounts, but in amounts that pretty much emptied the almost new bottle. Then I proceeded to eat it off of her almost entirely. We then proceeded to have the most sticky sex of my life.  A little later we were in doggy style on the edge of my bed and she said  harder , so I thrusted really hard and she ended up flying face first off the bed and into my desk.   Chocolate syrup 5/10 probably would do again if asked.  Accidentally shoving her into the desk and laughing  9/10 would do again.  Whole thing, 7/10. 9/10 with rice.",0,1422383401,AskReddit,1,0

"To be fair, I did nazi that coming. I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 8/10 (10/10 with rice), would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at that; seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.  Wait, why do I have you tagged as  NOPE NOPE NOPE ? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This banana for scale gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download an ayy lmao. woosh.

"&gt;Use full powerscaling for him  Which is completely reasonable in DBZ. In a Superman vs Thor, we can take in account of Thor's magic for the fight. In Goku vs Cell, what do these guys use? Ki. And that's it. One feat of using ki can be replicated for another character with more ki.  &gt;Restrict Superman to objective feats  Because  lifting infinity  is hella vague and not even possible/quantifiable.  &gt;Disregard Superman's  outliers  (which is increasingly becoming interchangeable with   I don't like that feat ) and I'm not talking about lifting infinity  Like? Oh wait, just more bitching.  &gt;Separate Superman's speed into  travel  and  combat , as if he's blindly plowing through every celestial object in his path when he's zooming through space at massively faster than light speeds. Seriously, wtf  Do you even know what acceleration is?  &gt;Justify Goku's phyiscal strength through nebulous arguments such as   he made Frieza bleed and Frieza survived an exploding planet so he has planet busting punches . All my wut. This leads to:  Actually no, the argument is that Frieza has planetary level durability, due to his survival of a planetary+ level explosion. Is this really that hard for you people to understand?  &gt;Treating durability with respect to energy and physical force as the same thing. I've yet to see any proof that energy translates exactly to physical force. Using this logic Thor has universe busting physical strength because he cracked Galactus' armor, and Superman has solar system busting punches because he made Wonder Woman bleed. Obviously this is bullshit, so why is it tolerated when this argument is made for Goku?  Except Frieza's physical durability is explicitly shown by an objective feat. Something this guy has been bitching DBZ fans don't use (while conveniently ignoring the evidence). It is then shown *that a completely physical attack* one-shotted him. How is this nebulous?  &gt;This is obviously BS, even though some stuff I said is true. I conveniently left out that Starfire's regular blasts aren't planet busting, used the  hurts a character who tanked an X blast  argument for her physical strength, used an energy durability feat and twisted it into physical durability, and handwaved away Thor's gigantic strength and durability advantage. Starfire is a bit faster than Thor, but that won't mean shit because Thor completely outclasses her physically.  And his whole argument is complete shit. See, in comics and other mediums, there is generally other factors at play. Look at Majin Buu. Why was he so dangerous? Vegeta was kicking his ass six ways to Sunday. He even blasted holes through him. His *special ability* made him a complete bitch to put down. There were other factors at play.  **However** 99% of the time in DBZ there is ki. There is no hard counter to ability. It's literally A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;E. Unless you think that Saiyan Saga piccolo &gt; SSJ God Goku since Piccolo has better feats. It's completely asinine that DC fans don't take in the medium of writing when making their arguments. It'd save me so many headaches.   Also, a mother fucking planet exploding is physical. Do people not understand what an explosion is? Holy shit. He destabilized the freaking core and forced it to explode. It wasn't a ki attack that he tanked.  So not only does his argument not take in account of how DBZ actually works, it's like he didn't even read the scans and then tried arguing against them.  &gt;If I seriously tried to make that argument, I'd get laughed out of the thread (and rightfully so), but replace  Starfire' with  Vegeta  and people will take me seriously. Search Vegeta vs Thor, we've all seen it.  Yes, for reasons stated above. Just because you don't put the five minutes of reading readily available scans/argumentation for them, doesn't mean that's our problem. There are completely **physical** feats that DBZ characters have.  &gt;There's like this magic thing that happens during DBZ vs Comics debates, where the absolutely obscene strength advantages of S-tiers either become mere afterthoughts or are thrown out the window entirely, when in other threads strength is given the consideration it deserves.  Except even piccolo has better destruction feats than anything Superman has ever shown. Please show me some scans of superman actually punching a planet apart, or even a moon, without moving at MFTL travel speeds that take him time to get up to that point. Exactly. Don't give me that bullshit.  &gt; If I made Spider-Man vs Aquaman thread, the top response will be  Aquaman is way stronger, he wins . You won't see people pontificating about how Spider-Man has better reflexes and he punched Hulk who took Silver Surfers' blast which was planet-busting that one time so he obviously can take Aquaman.  Again, does this guy even know what he's talking about?  1) Aquaman is way stronger, he wins  Yes, by feats. But let's look at One Punch Man. As far as I know he hasn't actually bench pressed anything, but we use the *durability feats* of his enemies in order to estimate his damage output. Sound familiar? Oh shit, that's exactly what we do for DBZ. Fucking crazy, huh?  2) You won't see people pontificating about how Spider-Man has better reflexes and he punched Hulk who took Silver Surfers' blast which was planet-busting that one time so he obviously can take Aquaman.  Oh my, it's almost like Hulk has an ability where he grows stronger as time progresses. Maybe by putting in context to his actual position would be better. If Spider-Man was punching WWH, and other characters that tier, on a regular basis, you can bet your sweet ass that Spider-Man &gt; Aquaman.  &gt;Even if we go insane with the fan calcs and power levels (which are crap according to Toriyama himself), no one in DBZ has anywhere the physical strength and durability of  weaker  S-tiers like Etrigan and Lobo (who can casually juggle trillions of tons), let alone Superman, Thor, Wonder Woman, Hyperion, etc.  Hmm, well how about you show me some of their damage output? Pure destructive/defensive capabilities? Or are we just taking [claims](http://i.imgur.com/Z5ifmLp.jpg) [seriously](http://i.imgur.com/2foL7HN.jpg) now? Because we still don't have any feats of superman just casually blowing up moons or tanking that amount of damage in return. Yet even Raditz can tank moon+ blasts like there is no tomorrow.  &gt;Let's put it this way: if Goku punched Superman with all his strength, he would make Superman bleed and knock him into orbit at best. If Superman did the same, Goku and spacetime itself would explode.  Haha fanwank much?  &gt;To be clear, I'm not against powerscaling during these debates. What I am against is treating DBZ like a special snowflake work of fiction that deserves to operate with different rules,   He does know that Anime =/= Comics? These are completely different mediums. Toriyama isn't going to insert a block of text saying  And it is stated that Vegeta's ki blast has a bajillion gigajoules of force.  Not that it matters, considering we have objective feats to fall back on.   &gt;where powerscaling  completely valid, unless you literally have 0 idea of how Ki works.  &gt;character statements  Have I used a character claim this entire time? Nope. Don't even need to. But let's touch on this. Cell's  Solar Busting Claim  has been confirmed via Word of God in the *Daizenshuu*. Many of the  feats  that Comic fans use come from the Narrative Text Box, so why isn't Cell's valid? Oh yeah, because they don't like it.  &gt;and ABC logic are used with reckless abandon  Again, completely valid in DBZ because of how Ki works. Unless again Saiyan Saga Piccolo &gt; SSJ God Goku, which if you claim you might be retarded.  &gt;If we're using feats, Superman stomps  Actually Piccolo does, he shits all over Superman with a single Ki blast.  &gt;If we're using feats and powerscaling, Superman stomps.  Still Piccolo.  &gt;If we use the /r/whowouldwin[1] special method of coddling DBZ, where we limit Superman to objective feats, tiptoe around Superman's ridiculous strength advantage and pretend it doesn't exist, liberally use the terms  PIS  and  outlier  wrt Superman, use powerscaling for Goku, separate travel speed and reaction speed, and generously assume Goku is marginally faster than Superman, Goku has a decent chance.  And once more, Piccolo.  See, easy   ***  Seriously, this guy sounds like he's never read DBZ in his life. He's pretty much the emulation of the DBZ anti-circle jerk. He sounds like he never actually took the time to read arguments against his position, he provides no actual evidence to support his position, he straw mans that shit out of the other side, a completely disingenuous argument.  0/10  4/10 with rice.

"This reminds me of the first time I hit a [10]. I didn't get quite as paranoid as you, but I had an unshakable and very extreme feeling that everyone around me didn't want me there and that no one was enjoying my presence. This got multiplied when one of the kids just took out their phone and called another kid to pick him up. So we all just stood around and made uncomfortable small talk until the kid that made the call and another kid left with the guy he called. They went out onto the deck we were all smoking on and I thought they were stealing all our weed and my friend's PAX. Then they walked out the front door and I checked all our stuff and it was all still there. After that I was 100% convinced that they were going to come back and shoot us because I accidentally drank one of the kid's milk.  All in all, it was a ok night.

"Ondar's Guile doubles chance to evade projectile attacks, and spells can't be evaded, and 2 * 0% = 0... however, I'll assume that OP meant for it to allow evasion of spells based on evasion of attacks. &lt;Math of Exile inbound&gt;  Since OG gives double evade chance for projectile attacks, and Ondar's Phase is half that, this gives 2 * 0.5 * evadeChance = evadeChance, meaning that 100% of evade chance for non-projectile attacks is applied to spells. Stack evasion, and it'll be hard for spellcasters to hit you.  Phase Acro would give 30% Spell Dodge, along with whatever evade chance you have. For the sake of calculation, we'll assume you have a 50% evade chance for non-projectile attacks.  When dodge is applied, you have a (1 - .3) * 100% = 70% chance to be hit with spells. Since Evasion (in this case, at least) and Dodge are effectively  less chance to hit  multipliers as far as spells are concerned, after evasion is applied, you'll have a (.7 * .5) * 100% = 35% chance to be hit by spells.  Additionally, if it were used with Vaal Grace (assuming lv20) and Phase Acro, you'd have 64% chance to dodge, along with whatever evade chance you have. When all this is applied, you'd have a ((1 - .64) * .5)* 100% = 18% chance to be hit. A 16% Spell Dodge Atziri's Step lowers the chance further to 10%. Vaal Grace can last for 15.90s with both Increased Duration clusters and either a 21/20 or 20/23 Inc. Duration gem.   It's an interesting idea, but I think this skill would actually be severly overpowered as-is. I don't really think there's any way to balance this so that it's still useful without being blatantly and outright overpowered.  I *think* i did my math right...  TL;DR 10% chance to be hit by spells with 50% evade chance using this, Phase Acro, Vaal Grace, and Atziri boots for potentially 16 secs.

Drunk me wouldn't shut up about how much I wanted a good BJ and I'd definitely pay for it. Roomie (in super form) took my wallet and keys, wrote his mobile number on my forearm, and gave one of those bicycle taxis 100 quid to bring me to go get a BJ. He also tipped the bouncer 20 to hold yet another 100 for the taxi guy to bring me back.  I blacked in-and-out through the whole experience but I would give it a 2/10. 4/10 with rice.  For clarification, the net finances were: me: -220 (my money, spent by roomie on my behalf) lady of the night: +60 bouncer: +20 taxi guy: +140 Roomie: whatever drinks he charged on my card while I was occupied.

"Oh I get it. You've never been to America right? That's literally the only explanation I have for your views so I hope I'm right.   &gt;less taxes   For the rich, sure. Trickle down economics amirite? It works, that's why the rich have gotten steadily richer and the poor have gotten steadily poorer since the 80's. Oh wait that means the opposite. Huh.   &gt;less laws, less regulations  For corporations. Like I said above, the Republicans are all about the  hey corporations are people now  and  hey go ahead and dump known carcinogens into our drinking water we'll fine you 20 bucks  but so far nothing on any actual drug law reform, prison reform, less laws for any common person... I mean, I don't blame them, if there's less laws there's less profit for the private prison industry, and then who would be the biggest campaign contributor for most politicians, Republicans included? I mean, the taxpayer is cool and all, but private prisons give gift baskets and run commercials.   &gt;less police  Gr8 b8 m8 8/8. I'm not even going to treat that one as serious. If you'd even been to the U.S. you'd know its political suicide for ANY politician to say anything short of  our boys in blue NEED a bulletproof drone equipped with a machine gun that shoots 'nonlethal' 'rubber' bullets and a tear gas dispenser capable of covering 40 square blocks.  I have literally never heard a politician, especially not a republican, say anything NEAR  less police.    You're clearly getting  republican  mixed up with  libertarian.  No actual libertarians hold office in the U.S. Its all neocons/other crazies who are searching for a label that fools the 18/30 demographic into thinking they've gone away from the norm.  Oh I see I just read the last bit, the things you pick out that are  not liberty  are pretty telling.

"I will endorse this recommendation.  It's reasonably small; the built in mics are surprisingly good and laid out in an XY configuraiton, and you can change the pickup pattern on those; it has a pair of XLR/¼  combo jacks on the bottom, and can record 4 tracks at once, two from the mics and two from the inputs.  Supports 44.1/48/96 kHz sample rates (96 is only available in stereo -- you need to drop to 44.1 or 48 for 4-channel) and 16- or 24-bit sample size.  It can also be used as a limited-capability sound card.  Files recorded to the SD card are standard WAV files (you get two at a time for 4-channel mode, but you can marry them back up in your DAW) on a standard FAT filesystem, so just about anything can read the card.  10/10 with rice.

Last act got a little offbeat and goofy. Daniel Radcliffe was great, very not Harry Potter even if his accent slipped a bit at times. Movie was funny at some points and his demon makeup was great.

"I've had two, they were both pretty awesome. Although the second one was pretty strange.  So the first one was pretty recently, like back in September. I go to a tech school that has an 85-15% ratio of girls to boys and most of the girls there are less than attractive. But this one girl in my math class that I sat behind was crazy hot. Like 8/10, 10/10 with rice. Anyway, since it's September it was pretty warm and for some reason she came in and sat down and started to take her sweat pants off (she had shorts on underneath) and sure enough, she accidentally grabbed her shorts as well and it was a nice way to start the morning.  The next time was stranger because I was at work, and at the time I worked with my mother and my cousin at a catering business. They usually held weddings there and such and one night my cousin excitedly hurries over to me and tells me to  come look at something.  Curious, I oblige and he leads me to a door thats open just a crack and he tells me to look inside. Sure enough, there were two bridesmaids in there getting it on. We went and told most of the guys we worked with but my mother found us and my cousin told her what was happening and she told all the men who were there, some of which who were in their 60's,  put it in the spank bank and get back to work.   10/10 though, would be at the right place and the right time again",0,1423165037,AskReddit,10,0

"&gt; While I agree that disclosure is good, the only reason you ever minded that was that there were women involved. Anyway, disclosure is pretty much the point where I agree.  This is a good reason why you should educate yourself before you pick a side. There were many rumblings of corruption in gaming journalism prior to Ms. Quinn's situation. Honestly, I don't think it matters the gender or race of the tipping point; corruption is corruption. The gaming journalists made it a gender thing... A curious position considering they just got called out. Also interesting, why has Mr. Gjoni been gagged and Ms. Quinn isn't pressing charges for slander/libel. There must be some truth there.  &gt; And yet that's how journalism tends to work. When there's a story, outlets all pile on to it.  No, this is not how journalism works at all. Journalists should never be close with those who they report on. Ask any respectable journalist and they will say it's a big no-no. If you actually think these relationships are okay, then you've answered my initial question.  &gt; Now that makes absolutely zero sense. If devs were concerned about being manipulated through metacritic, they'd just stop using metacritic to determine payment. AAA devs have journalists in their pockets, as many journalists have tried to tell you already. You have it completely the other way around.  What are you talking about? Their entire career relies souly on how it is received. It can be the greatest game ever played, but if it was systematically given poor reviews by multiple gaming journalists, then it's toast. You can't be serious in not understanding this dynamic.  &gt; Strangely you guys don't seem to mind calling McIntosh  cuck , calling Brianna  he  or  flynt  with zero proof of anything, calling srhbutts a  dogfucker  with zero proof as well, supporting a stalker like Fart, a harasser like Rogue, or a bully like Cernovich.  Not everyone. I've even seen 8chan Gamergate supporters get on others for doing this. Even the stream of Rev60 yesterday did not call out Mrs. Wu I'm that fashion. It seems you have a preconception of what you think is going on without acknowledging the many instances where it's the contrary.  &gt; Are they really? Or are they putting on an act because they know how the world sees them? It seems that as soon as they switch board, they also switch attitude. Or don't all the people in /baphomet/ talking about how GG are poor poor babies who don't deserve to be harassed strike you as odd regarding the general attitude of that sub?  And aGG call us foil hats? This is hilarious. While Gamergate supporters have provided substantial evidence for corruption, this unicorn thread/convo of hidden scheming against women should be concerning, not accepted. Every thread started on targeting an individual is met with  gr8 b8 m8, I r8 8/8.   As for baph, they have called us out a number of times for trying to stand firm and not play into the label that gaming journalists have put on us. Gamergate does nothing with baph because they are a loose cannon.  &gt; My position is based on your proof being insubstantial and motivated by personal vendettas against the opinions of certain journalists who are the only ones whose  ethics  get checked, and by the attitudes I've seen you guys espouse.  We hold every gaming publication accountable, and even ourselves. You talk as if you haven't even read what KiA and /gamergate/ has said, just followed what others have said.

"Oh boy, here we go. Just last year, my buddy had broken up with his girlfriend. She was super torn up about this, and I decided, 'shit man, she's crying right now, and we're friends. This is bad.'

"Right, I'm assuming preparation which means recon, and also assuming that Mal doesn't assume dragon form by default (though if she was being rational, maybe she would). The ice would just be a firing mechanism for iron, which I assume is readily available (or Elsa could set up supply chains for her minions).  All that said, Mal never exhibited her Final Form (tm) since she was gloating in Disney canon.

So I'm less confident now. Elsa perhaps 6/10 with ~~rice~~ ice.",0,1423416149,whowouldwin,3,0

"So basically at the rip young age of a 7th grader I was at home on a unnaturally beautiful sunday, the temperature was perfect, I had a decent day and was overall really exited for the steak we were marinating. ( i never got to eat it :(  )  I was taking out the trash when the sirens came on, luckily there was a siren extremely close to where i lived. If you googled st. pauls church I was within that surrounding couple of miles.   our family has had and still has a great plan when the sirens go off. Grab all living things and pile in the basement, and if given the opportunity and time grab things like cell phones, wallets, car keys, (not that keys were useful ) and keep those in the basement as well. Then wait as a loud and obnoxious thunderstorm rolled through, but that night was different to say the least.   Before we knew the severity of the storm my father and I heard a loud pop from the main floor and he went up to check on it. Turns out the Tv in our living rooms capacitors popped from overvoltage or something along those lines, (i wasnt extremely concerned about it at the time, you know, more important matters) He has told me that after he checked the tv he almost went to check something in the kitchen but decided to come back downstairs instead, and I am very glad he did because he could have gotten really hurt.  He came back downstairs and I mentioned that I was hearing quiet the rumbling off in the distance, I had noticed it for a minute or two But it was so quiet i thought I may be hearing things. Boy was I wrong.   Eventually we figured out that the 747 trying to land on our house was in fact an EF5 tornado and hopped in the bathroom down there. Rode out the storm with my parents, my dog, and my frog.   The exceptionally weird thing about the whole experience down there was how my senses kicked into overdrive. The actual tornado was probably over our house for about 30-40 seconds in total. But it felt closer to 5 minutes.   It is surreal to be able to recognize the sound of the house you have built your life in for the past 7 years ripping apart by a natural force. It is insane because in my mind I could very clearly make out the large crash of our vehicle (although i didnt know it was a vehicle, just something big) crashing through the wall into my room, I could hear electronics popping and transformers blowing, I could hear the roof peeling away from our house. the thing that amazed me is that I could hear all of this as clear as day while the tornado blew over. Hearing everything separate, but also together.   After the storm was over we came out to assess the damage and saw that it was just as the pictures show. FUBAR. It is very hard on a person to experience something like watching and listening your own home be ripped to shreds while you are inside of it. But it is harder to see once the adrenaline stops. There was mass destruction everywhere. Luckily no gas leaks within my area.   My family went into damage control mode. We gathered all of our clothes and everything that was of sentimental value and started to pile it up in our basement so that they wouldnt get too wet. It rained for quiet a while after the tornado.  That night my uncle came and picked us up and we had to walk about two miles to get to his car from where he was forced to park. We lived with him for six weeks out in mount vernon until we found a home also in joplin and moved back. (also with a basement, of course)   The entire experience gave me a few new feelings.  1. the feeling of community about the town was insane. for a short while, everyone was family. You saw someone and you offered everything you had to help. My father went out to my neighbors house and helped them out of their basement because there house was flattened where as ours still had quiet a few walls. He literally gave that man the shirt he was wearing because the our neighbor wasnt wearing one and his blew away. My father has always been one of my heros but he definitely made me a happy boy then. They dont say joplin strong for nothing anymore.  2. The feeling of how frail we are as humans. That life is fragile and can be stripped from us without warning in an instant. It has really made me value what I have more as a person.   3. The feeling of strength, to oppose the above feeling, I feel like now that I have survived this traumatic event, I am a much stronger person.  It has been a few years now, Im sixteen and a junior in highschool. I have maintained a 3.92 GPA and am in the top 7% of my class. I think the entire experience really shaped who I am today. probably for the better.   But not a day goes by when I dont think about how lucky I am that my entire family was ok. That is why I never cried, I never shed a tear, I never really showed much emotion at all. But on the inside I was beyond happy that I was ok, and my family was ok.   Funny thing is, and you probably wont believe it, but the hardest part about the entire thing was that my grandparents house burnt down the next day. That was the hardest thing about it all, because They had nowhere to go, but they are old. They have nothing of what they used to. And that was the first time I saw my father cry.   Life can really deal you a shit deck of cards sometimes, but just remember it all gets better eventually.   TL;DR Tornado was not fun, 1/10, 2/10 with rice, keep your family close, enjoy life, always have a plan. and Read the damn post   heres a link to that essay with a few different details and hopefully better grammar.

I'm talking smoking hot. 175/10 with rice, that's how hot this fucker was. I do what any normal man would do, I pick it up and proceed to bang the hell out of it at a furious pace. Everything is going great, then I hear this music playing. I turn and see a unicorn playing sweet child o' mine in perfect tune. My god, I didn't think it could get any hotter, but it did. This pushes me beyond my breaking point. I start banging the tortoise shell at what must be the speed of light. I'm getting ready to inseminate this wonderful historic shell of hotness when all of a sudden, my dick explodes into a million pieces, as does the tortoise shell. Fragments of dick and hot sexy tortoise shell make an IED like bombardment of shrapnel and rip the only known talented unicorn who plays the fife to shreds, ending the miracle that was. TLDR: fucked a sexy old tortoise shell, killed the only talented unicorn left on earth",0,1424033803,AskReddit,1,0

"Well, I'm real hype for this rewatch. One of my favorite animes out there, definitely. Imma be taking notes while I watch.   - They already hitting us with some of the most feels-y music of the series.   - Watching subs this time around, first and only watch was with the dub.   - God the art in this show is fucking beautiful.   - Classic Sunohara getting rekt.   - Hey it's the first Illusionary world scene. I actually like these.   - I forgot about Ryou's fortunetelling thing.   - Kinda feel bad for lonely Nagisa.   - Oh shit, it's goin' down with Tomoyo. Those kicks.   - Aaaaaand so starts the daily Sunohara vs Tomoyo fight scenes.   - Sanae's bread 10/10 with rice.   - I dunno, I kinda like Akio's dub voice more. He's still awesome though.   -  Okazaki Tomoya Eternal , God I fucking love the Furukawas   -  Shall I take you to the place where wishes come true?    Overall, great episode, but sadly there was no best girl Kotomi. God I can't wait to watch this whole series with y'all.   Edit: I can't format",0,1424042321,anime,8,0

"[Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/penrose_triangle)  Today I unfortunately didn't perform a completely-out-of-my-way act of random kindness for a stranger, however I did hold open the door for about 30 - 50 people. I was the first one of my crowded public bus and I am a fast walker so I managed to reach the front doors of my high school first. So I held open the door for the huge crowd of students behind me.   As for why I want the game, it looks like a prefect way to express some creativity. Recently I have been craving for some new mentally expressive activities (I love to think :D), I already play instruments (piano &amp; clarinet) and I already am in the progress of learning new languages (French &amp; German), and I already avidly read (love classical literature) and write (I like writing essays for some reason, they help organize my thoughts, as well as increase my writing ability significantly more than if I were to write fiction) and code (I know HTML, CSS, JS, and C#). After all that I still manage to have a 1-hour chunk in my schedule that I can use to game. Besiege looks like an awesome game for me, something I can put hours into, working every meticulous detail, and then take a step back and appreciate my work.

"It was a slow weekend for gaming, but I do believe I've converted 2 more to our flock.  **Keyflower**We went over to our son's babysitter's house to play, and they had invited over another couple (also parents) for games. We had converted our babysitter and her husband to the hobby with**Splendor** and **Lords of Waterdeep**, and they had been talking big game to the other couple about how they were going to clean house at **LoW**.  Unfortunately, LoW only plays 5, and there were 6 of us. I had brought along **Rise of Augustus** in case they were timid gamers, and **Keyflower** if they were down to compete. Everyone agreed to Keyflower, so I set it up and got  to explaining how to play.  Explaining this game took what seemed like hours, mostly due to the fact we are all parents and someone was always leaving to make sure a baby was still asleep, or using the bathroom, or fetching beer. We finally made it through and the game was afoot.  This group caught on fast. New mom asked a lot of questions throughout the game and halfway through Summer season was saying she wanted to play this again already (she made 4th place). Babysitter took awhile to figure out moving goods and upgrades but finally caught on by Winter. She ended up with the most aesthetically pleasing village and 2nd to last. Babysitter's husband (always wins LoW) came in last by 1 point with his 3 tile village, focusing on gold hoarding for VP.    The top 3 players were about 15-20 points of the losing group. I came in 3rd with a strong emphasis on transport tiles (I had the boat that doubled them and got the winter boat for VP for transport, very luckily). My wife took 2nd -1 point more than me- with no set strategy. She picked up the boat that let her bid on tiles with whatever colors, which nabbed her good winter tiles. The winner was new mom's husband, first by 1 point over my wife. He nabbed the mines early and was shoveling coal into his coal warehouse for 3vp each. He would have had more points from that but misplaced his warehouse 2 tiles away from his mine instead of next to it.  Teaching this and playing with 4 new players took a loooong time, but everyone enjoyed themselves. I have yet to win this game and still love every minute of it. 10/10, 11/10 with rice, 12/10 with less interruptions.",0,1424711200,boardgames,1,0

"Her maneuvering was a definite contributing factor to the car flip and I think that is also one reason the other car wasn't to damaged. Both cars were totaled though (although our car was still running five minutes after the flip). We will most likely go to retrieve items left in the car from the tow company and I'll try to get pictures of the Honda if that is a possibility. I was also told that the speedometer of the other car could have  stuck  in place or created an impression on the back board on impact, so I'll also just have a look at the speedometer if I am  allowed . I really don't know the speed at which the other car was going but I do know that it was definitely over the speed limit due to witness accounts and from my point of view, it was flying toward us.

"hey man, i'm a videographer myself and i enjoyed your stuff. if you don't mind i'd like to put in a bit of feedback based around the cinematography and editing. i watched and rewatched your video a few times focusing on different elements  1) first, i love the look of acceptance as he crabbed and took a dive. however i feel like that could have been a nice transition from the high pace part of the song to the much slower section.  2) small nitpick - but the focus shift boat on the slings felt weird. i feel like it should have been towards the camera - being both more pleasant and almost bringing the audience in more.  3) personally, i think a song such as this is a little (i hate to say it like this) mainstream sounding and doesn't fit as well (just the way it sounds when combined with rowing doesn't fly with me for some reason - although it is in my steady state playlist). the shot transitions after the drop were pleasantly timed though. before that was a little random and inconsistent with the song (hence less pleasing). the transition from the first drop to when the guy is holding the oar felt mis-timed (wait to cut to him). obviously, you cut to the music and put the calmer shots when the music was itself calmer - which was well done.  4) the shot angle of the singles racing at 1:17 and 2:17 is tight. however, after the second timecode - you switch to a single with a low stroke rate, which feels misplaced (i would keep the high paced pieces in the high paced section of the song). however, i understand training trips usually consist of low stroke rates with high amount of focus on technique. because of this - the song i would choose would need to reflect the style of the trip (perhaps something with less drops?). personally i'll spend about a week finding the song that could accurately represent the overall feel of the trip. it is very difficult to work with footage that is mostly low paced and fit it to a high paced song.   doing a very quick search through some of my music, i found a song that to use as an example (so you can see where i'm coming from) and represents something that could capture what is a training trip and be fun to edit to - [Rather Be ft. Jess Glynne \(Merk &amp; Kremont Remix\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKiJMxGBZi8)(personally i would take out the first 30 seconds). it has only 2 main drops that could be filled with quicker rowing pace and the rest isn't too fast for slower establishing,  team having fun , and rowing shots.  5) gopro shot at 3:12! oh boy love those (basically my main method of filming) - eg. [something i made 2 and a half years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SGvpytYlM). The thing with them is the color correction. they require a fair amount of attention to get pleasant coloring, let alone any style of the film you're trying to attain. at the very end, try to match the whites with the shot before it. same thing goes with almost all of the shots in general. a good mixing of colors can really make a video pop and please the audience and film kids like me. it will help make it look more natural and less... gopro-y. if you know about dynamic stretching, it works wonders on when we mount on boats (since it is a fixed viewpoint).  6) gopro aside, i'm pumped you used an actual camera (i'd be interested to know all the details most wouldn't). it looks really pretty  7) title zoom off the shirt at the end - brilliantly done. took me a second look to realize what you did  Overall 8.9/10, 9.9/10 with rice.

"I'm a TA for 281. The work is about 10 hours a week, and it doesn't feel bad at all because I never have to  switch gears.  (put on a uniform, do something I don't want to be doing, etc.) The pay is GREAT ($23/hour) and it basically means I don't have to think twice when getting food, etc. (I do not pay my own tuition/housing costs though). Generally, most of our work consists of office hours, discussions, and making HW and projects. Grading is a bitch (took us about 10 hours to grade the exams yesterday) but that's only twice a semester. Your debugging skills improve greatly, as do your communication skills.

"Okay listen, hes only in gold 3 and is improving at a good steady rate. The only reason hes playing bad now due to the long hiatus. Hes still trying to learn about the 123 champions ingame and their abilities aswell as learning all the matchups.   Its true that hes pretty bad, but the fact that everyone that has played lol regularly can see it means its pretty easy to fix(bad decision making and mechanics).    He doesn't need coaching because hes not stuck in a elo trying to figure out how to get to the next division. He knows his own mistakes and hes playing each game rationally. I mean if u really watched his stream you can listen to his thought process and reasoning for everything aswell as him asking people for advice.  Anyway nice b8 m8 r8 8/8",0,1425208753,Destiny,1,0

"It was a cold November in Chicago that year. I stumbled to my fridge after burrowing a path through the mountains of old food and dirty clothes. I stood there basking in the harsh light from the open door. I reach into the box of mountain dew game fuel. Empty.  Fucking perfect  I mumbled while fighting with the empty box that is now stuck on my arm. I rubbed my neck beard in frustration. I dread what this means. Being stuck in public with all the fucking moronic mouth breathers of the world, not the intellectual elite like me and the rest of my WoW and LoL clans. I grab my fedora off the coat rack and pull it down tight on my greasy hair. I get my trench coat from the closet. I notice that my favorite pony apple jack has hidden himself under my coat.  I did nazi that coming!  I yell at apple jack. He laughs and I pick him up twirling him through the air. I give him a kiss before I set out on the most noble of quests. After setting him back in the closet I grabbed my steel toe combat boots. Lacing them up like they do on CS:GO, I proceeded to put my zombie killing pocket knife, complete with window smasher and seatbelt cutter into the bottom pocket of my cargo shorts. Most people get cold legs, but not me, my genes have given me a healthy layer of insulation. All the sheeple say I need to loose weight but they don't know anything. I look in the mirror and get ready to set out on my quest. I'm looking good, 10/10 with rice. I trudge up the stairs out of my basement. Mom yells at me to not wear my boots in the house. What a fucking communist. I grab the keys for the Windstar, my noble steed, and head out the door, the wicked bitch barking questions at me about when I'll get a  real  job. I have tried to explain to her that real jobs are for sheeple, she's just not an intellectual like me though. I slam the door in defiance. I drive to the store while playing my music, flipping through my cellection of Frank Sinatra, Creed, and Cannibal Corpse CDs. I finally found my Queen Cd burried under the bags of chee wees, McDonald's, and empty cans of dew. I made it to the parking lot of Rolands gas station. I do all my shopping here because it isn't run by the oppresive communists at Wal-Mart. After filling my cart with the sweet nectar of the gods I grabbed some slim jims and cheetos. I placed my goods on the counter and itched my armpit, and then smelled it. The counter girl watched me and with a look of disgust, I laughed at her. She was maybe a solid 7/10 so I wasn't going to waste my time with this wench. I pulled my fedora lower to cover my eyes. The total came to $19.56. I pulled out my zelda chain wallet from my back pocket. It made a loud ripping noise as the Velcro seperated. The cashier now suddenly shifted her expression from disgust to lust after seeing the amount of cash I had, $230 in small bills that I got for my birthday 4 months ago. I gave her a 20 winked, tipped my fedora, and smiled as I told her to keep the change, you could almost hear the panties dropping. I don't fuck anything under a nine though. She is just a whore who is after my money. I drive back home and return to the musty, damp basement. I fire up my custom gaming rig and pick some crumbs off the keyboard. I open reddit with a speed that can only be described as blinding. Few people can type 45 words per minute like me. I go over my replies and begin the daily task of downvoting sheeple who can't see the real truth like I can. I lean back and take a gulp of dew as I hit enter on a reply to a guy who says religion isn't bad. What a sheep. I then go to gonewild and tell all the women there that it is gross that they have small tits and wierd nipples and I would never fuck them.",0,1425252134,justneckbeardthings,8,0

"PhD Candidate in Molecular Biology here:  - The calories determined on the side of your food are determined by tests like calorimetry where they literally burn the food/substance in a very precise manner (they know how much energy they put in) and see how much excess energy is released. So calories are based off of the assumption of 100% absorption.  - The body is pretty damn good at what it does, so most of the time, if you're healthy, you'll be at or near 100% absorption. For instance, I have Crohn's, so if I get a flare up I can expect my damaged ulcerated and inflammed GI tract to be pretty inefficient. Another more common example would be a bad gallbladder, which would make you very inefficient at digesting fats (you would have runny burning greasy shits and probably immense pain in your chest/shoulder blade). Another example might be runner's shits, which is like the compounding interest of the diet world (it's a real thing). But for most healthy humans, you can conservatively assume that your body digests a very significant portion of the food. There is undoubtedly variation amongst healthy people. I don't have a source for you, but from my general experience I would estimate it at plus or minus a pop tart.  - Shit is not *completely* calorie free. Bugs eat that shit, because there's still a very small amount of undigested food substances in there. Also, shit is ~2/3 dead bacteria, so that's  calories  as well. 0/10, would not recommend if stranded on an island. 2/10 with rice.  TL;DR These humans with inefficient GI tracts are usually pretty noticeably diseased (i.e. painful inflammation of the GI tract, chronic diarrhea, etc.). Undigested food + osmotic effect in colon = diarrhea. The variation from healthy person to healthy person is pretty small and nearly negligible. I'd say well within error of how well most humans are at counting calories, anyway.  +/- a pop tart.",0,1425399846,fatpeoplehate,33,0

I know you hate it, but your server is DOA, and you can 'fanboy', as you call it, as hard as you want to for it, but with admins and developers such as yourself trolling subreddits, picking fights, and making up issues where none exist, it reflects poorly on your currently undeveloped community and ensures your server's failure (See Vengeance's history for details).   Your insanely defensive responses to literally everything make it abundantly clear you have your own agenda, and most of your commentary goes directly to ad-hominems (calling people unintelligent, fanboys, really now?). Most of your complaints were outdated instantly, however. If you actually did play on the server you'd know that they fixed nearly everything you're complaining about (I checked, stealth works fine, and I have yet to see any LOS issues except the image from Vengeance, at least pick REAL issues).

"Each of the parts has slightly different origins:  ##360 quickscope##  Quickscoping is a tactic used in shooters where you zoom in with a sniper rifle but shoot before the graphics actually show where you are zoomed. Certain games gave you an accuracy boost as soon as you started the zoom regardless of when the animation actually showed you zoomed in. Extremely fast quickscopes just look like you shooting the gun without scoping at all.  The 360 part comes from people turning their aiming sensitivity up and spinning around in a circle before shooting. It is just trick shooting in video games.  ##8##  There are a series of words that people like to chain together that all contain an  8  sound in them:  &gt; gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8  It's a very specific variation on [textese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language) that intentionally takes it as far as it can be taken. Now it is mostly used as another way to say  cool story bro .  EDIT: /u/E-Squid [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2y8hkr/what_is_the_origin_of_the_m8_gr8_360_quickscope/cp7jubk) that the  b8  chunk was especially popular on 4chan in case you were curious about that particular one.  ##MLG##  MLG is Major League Gaming which is one of the larger eSports leagues. People like to claim they are MLG players because they think it gives them some sort of credibility.  ##Yolo / Swag##  YOLO is You Only Live Once and it was a big tag on social media sites for awhile. Swag somehow became associated with it and now you see yoloswag. EDIT: /u/DarkDubzs [has a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2y8hkr/what_is_the_origin_of_the_m8_gr8_360_quickscope/cp7y8yt) for where the swag part came from:  &gt; People who usually said Yolo or supposedly lived by it dressed and acted with  swag  with brands like Obey and other street/urban wear, flashy clothing, big shoes, accessories, etc, and one main thing... snapbacks, they were everywhere. It looked ridiculous and soon became a trend, then was ridiculed and anything associated with Yolo swag.  ##420 blaze it##  Both 420 and  blaze it  are references to smoking weed. A lot of kids who posted videos showing off their self-proclaimed MLG level skillz had names like  XXX420blazeitXXX  and it became a quick target when the parodies starting showing up.  ##Illuminati Confirmed##  The Illuminati is just a classic conspiracy theory and it gets trotted out whenever people are making fun of conspiracy theorists. Illuminati Confirmed references a specific group of parodies of the issue.  ##Altogether##  So the reason you might see all of these near each other now is that people are chaining jokes that were only somewhat related as a meta-joke on the whole subject. There is no particular reason this group of jokes is seen together other than:  * Many of them are related to parodies of the ridiculous montages popular from shooters (specifically, 360, quickscope, MLG, 420 blaze it) * Most of them are poking fun at people who think they are better or more intelligent than average (specifically, m8/gr8, 360, quickscope, MLG, swag, Illuminati Confirmed) * Someone once chained them first and it grew as its own meme  Hope that helps.",0,1425744500,OutOfTheLoop,400,0

"One of my favourites is chickpea and spinach curry. Easier and cheaper than it tastes. It is also a huge source of protein and you can't argue against the iron content of spinach.  Ingregients: Onion - Garlic - Vegetable oil - Madras curry powder - Chickpeas (1 tin) - a lot of spinach - salt, pepper and a lemon  Finely dice an onion and leave it to melt in a frying pan over low heat in a few tablespoons of oil.  Bash a few cloves of garlic, i never bother chopping them, I just smash them with the flat of a massive knife and pull the intact skin of their demolished pulp. Chuck them in with the onions when they look halfway golden. Stir very occasionally.  When the garlic smells cooked dump in a ton of madras curry powder and stir it in, frying the lot until the spices smell more like a curry house, less like a spice shop.  Drain your tin of chickpeas and drop them in, stir them in coating them with the spices and onion, let it heat back up and boil the kettle.  Stick a little bit of boiling water in and just let it bubble, when the chickpeas soften crush a few of them with your wooden spoon releasing starch which causes the lot to thicken.  With complete disregard, upturn your bag of spinach into the lot and put the lid on until it wilts in the steam, then stir in the spinach. let it cook until you are bored of waiting, season aggressively with salt and pepper and squeeze the lemon in. Lemon juice seriously improves this dish IMO.  10/10 with rice.",0,1426010078,Cooking,2,0

"Reading these comments is certainly strange. I absolutely loved the everloving shit out of this game. Of course I hated the little girl, kay? Everyone did. As soon as I could, she was out of the party.  Was the story weak? A little, but I still enjoyed it. It reminded me a lot of Phantasy Star 1,2 and 4, if you've ever played those (THIS IS THE JRPG FORUM I HOPE YOU HAVE!)  Gameplay was absolutely awesome to me, I thought I'd hate it but I loved it.  My major complaint was the end of the game. I was able to strongarm most of the content of the game until you get to the final area. The monsters were just unbelievably powerful in that they didn't really scale with previous content. Rather than grind levels I just skipped all the monsters up until the last boss. Last boss took a couple attempts, so it was somewhat enjoyable.  Overall 8.5/10  (10/10 with rice)",0,1426089564,JRPG,-1,0

"The temps weren't as bad for me, but because I had overpacked my first year, I severely underpacked my second year. I ran out of food on Thursday, but a good friend saved me. He brought a ton of extra MRE's as his playa gifts and gave me enough to survive til Sunday. (Edit: Scott if you read this I can't express my gratitude enough.)  I experienced less and more at the same time. My first year I was really tentative about exploring deep playa, so I stuck to the city. My second year I ventured out into deep playa more often, but didn't see much of the city.  Overall I'd say 7/10, 10/10 with rice.",0,1426136243,BurningMan,3,0

"I feel like this song feels...unfinished. Maybe I'm just so used to the riff being a life jam that I can't imagine it as a song. Lyrics get a 0/10. The first word we hear is  love .  But lyrics are normally just on the side for me.   I dislike the sergeant voice a lot. So much that it almost ruins the song. Also, the chorus is pretty terrible. The song feels very repetitive.  Compared to The 2nd Law, I would put it below Survival, Supremacy, Animals, and Panic Station. Above everything else though. Weird song to display first.   edit: I'm just excited for more falsetto   edit^2: I meant weird song to display first because I think it is the *least* shocking pre-single they have released in my opinion. And as the hours have passed (and I listened to it 22 more times), I think it is comparable quality to Supremacy. Gotta let that hype finish fluctuating though. I downloaded the non-sergeant version and it makes me like the song *so* much more. And the repetitive-ness is less bad than I expected.   But, lyrics are still garbage. Don't really care though, ignoring them is easy. I still think it sounds unfinished, like they forgot to do something. Its like they forgot how to make a raw sound, so they just make it sound half done. And that guitar solo is a disappointment.   All in all, I like it. 6.5/10. 3/10 with rice (the cadet's mouth got full and it sounded weird that way).",0,1426184345,Muse,5,0

"Doris by Earl Sweatshirt was something pretty damn incredible. Except for Guild. Guild was just awful. I like Mac Miller, and I love the grimy, low flow that most of the album carries, but Guild just took the idea and ran with it, right off a cliff. The lyricism was clever, especially on Mac's part, but not nearly substantial enough to earn that song a place on the album. And wtf with Molasses? I like the juxtaposition of the typical somber and depressive lyrics with the playful yet hard OF lines, i really do. But shit, the volume jumps up too damn much when that song comes on, and it's so mid driven that even when I turn it down those guitars are so forward in the mix that I scramble to change to something, anything else.   9/10, 10/10 with rice.",0,1426302692,Music,1,0

"My first real apartment was a fucking shitstorm of weird. Not all bad, but weird.   ROOMMATE 1: Had anger management issues, but downplayed how serious they were. He and I planned to talk to ROOMMATE 2 about his hygiene issues, and I took a nap waiting for 1 to come back from work. Woke up to the sound of screaming and breaking glass, 1 yelling the most horrible things at 2, 2 sounding confused as hell. After that night he ran away, broke his lease, and only came back once to grab some of his shit. Left a bunch that I wound up selling to make rent, since he didn't pay his rent for that month, either.  ROOMMATE 2: This one was unfortunate. He was a pretty withdrawn person in general, and we didn't find this out until months after all of this, but an aunt he was very close to died suddenly near the beginning of the school year. He became deeply depressed, and rarely left his room. The smell was astounding, and was what drove ROOMMATE 1 to such extreme retaliation. Eventually, 2 just sort of disappeared. We needed another roommate, so ROOMMATE 4 and I had to clean it. The carpet was coated - *actually coated* with an inch-thick layer of sunflower seed hulls. There were piles of old school papers and trash in every corner of the room. His bare mattress was still moist from sweat after a month by itself, and black mold was growing on the bottom. ROOMMATE 4 and I wound up having to buy arm-length gloves, aprons, and face-masks to clean the place, and had a fistfight over who got to use the shower first when we finished.  ROOMMATE 3: This guy was just weird. He could NOT sleep in a bed. Refused to buy a mattress, just slept either on his floor in a pile of dirty laundry or on the couch. Ate nothing but ramen and Vienna sausages, and smelled like them. Disappeared for two months, found out he'd met a girl and stayed over at her place, and just decided to keep staying over, without it ever occurring to him that maybe he should tell his roommates about it.  ROOMMATE 4: This guy was originally intended to replace ROOMMATE 1. I knew him vaguely from online stuff and mutual friends, and he was looking to get out of the Deep South, so I invited him to stay in the spare room and he got a plane ticket and headed up. His hair had grown past his waist, and honestly made his 6'5 self look like Bigfoot. He spent all his time playing World of Warcraft, or watching YouTube-poops and laughing like a maniac. Once came home high on mushrooms, and stood in my doorway while I was focused on a computer game, watching me silently for at least ten minutes before he just started screaming. I had no idea what was wrong with him, and was trying to figure out what he was on. He ate my feather collection, vomited all over himself, and then began undressing. That's when I went into my room, locked my door, and tried my hardest to sleep while I heard him thrashing around and screaming in the living room. The next morning, I found him just in his underwear. I gave him a glass of water, helped him into the shower, and managed to get him headed to work. He was actually the best roommate out of the four. 8/10, 10/10 with rice, would room again, he and I are still good friends.",0,1426331905,AskReddit,2,0

I loved the area you could explore, I loved the survivalist's backstory and all the cool gear you got from him, especially his combat armor. Because it looks like NCR combat ranger armor but I don't have to deal with the stupid faction thing. I actually liked the .45 auto pistol, I think it's cool because it looks like an actual normal handgun and is better than the other normal looking gun, the 9mm one. When I ran through as a unarmed guy, the bear gauntlets were great. The story is alright and the resources everywhere helped me out so much. I am big on the survival trait, it's one of my favorites so being able to make the recipes cuz I could actually get the ingredients was great.

"A lot of the spinning is gr8 b8 m8 8/8. They purposely miss an attack and combo into another to hit you before you've wound up your own attack.  You see a vanguard swing his sword, you know he's out of range, so you wind up an overhead to smack him just as he gets to you, but as soon as the vanguard has swung, he combos into a stab, which hits YOU before you have finished lifting your sword over your head. You then start to panic, thinking he will hit you again, so you right click and defensively raise your sword up for the parry, the vanguard knows this, and after he stabbed, he combos into a dragged overhead - he looks as far up as he can, and overheads, and what this does is ensure that the tail-end of the strike hits you just after your parry has expired and you go into recovery.   So, it's not nonsense. It's a series of well-executed mind-games, precision and skill, and is the reason why this game is still alive, a buggy fucking mess, years later. Because the depth of playstyles, the gritty combat and the banter voice commands make it one of the most fun and rewarding (and frustrating) games ever.",0,1426468110,ChivalryGame,7,0

Shameful reporting, no consideration of arguements for the other side. It seems like she is purporting legal recourse be ignored, what should we do instead Kutner? Follow our emotional reactions and lynch this man?   There's no details or analysis on if the specific case was consensual at all. Statutory rape is different.

"are you &gt;implying every single joke on reddit hasn't been overdone 1000 times?  clears throat  To be fair, I did nazi that coming. I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10. 10/10 with rice xd, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F  about tree fiddy  was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as  NOPE NOPE NOPE ? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS. ...this kills the redditor.  OP will surely deliver. op pls, pls op pls respond that link is staying blue.  In the meantime, I'll show myself out.  Directed by M. Night Shamallama.  As long as the 'fad' for plagiarising other peoples' witty comments doesn't die out, I guess I'm cool.  *edit: I accidentally a word  this community is fucking shit, every comment section of every top post has some variation of this garbage re-iterated as the top comment. and you unoriginal idiots upvote it like it's the punniest thing you have ever seen. low effort jokes all day long.  edit: LOL THX FRONT PAGE POST OBLIGATORY XDDDDD  actual edit: removed thanks for the gold.

Yeah, he probably pulled the number out of his ass, and the 1:1 equivalency is bullshit, but I'm guessing he's making a rhetorical point about Pfizerweinerberg or whatever. Maybe artsy students *are* being pushed out by posher artsy students - I don't know, I'm in America. The gist of his comment is that these neighborhoods are starting to look less DIY and therefore less appealing to the people that originally gentrified them, *which is a real thing*. It's really not a big deal.  Edit: now that you quote it, I really don't see any bad economics.

"Alors dans mes années wild... Je sortais avec une nana mais on était un peu dans une relation  open  (en y reflechissant, c'etait une mauvaise idée...).  Et donc durant ce temps j'ai dragué une fille qui avait des gros seins (c'etait la seule raison, j'ais toujours eu des copines avec des petits seins alors je voulais essayer).   Donc un soir je suis allé chez elle pour niquer, et c'etait vraiment pas bien. Elle était nulle, j'étais tout pourri aussi, c'était pas fun et pas rigolo.     Ensuite je suis rentré me coucher chez moi. Le lit était un lit simple et elle etait un peu grosse, donc meme si j'etais taillé comme une brindille a l'époque, c'etait pas facile.  Et pis une semaine apres on a re-niqué. Et c'etait toujours pas terrible.  Et les seins étaient flasques :(  **TL;DR:** rien a garder de cette partie de jambe en l'air et ca a un peu foiré ma relation avec ma meuf de l'époque. 0/10, 1/10 with rice.",0,1426770310,france,20,0

For someone with a degree in the music business everything they said up until the point I had to stop watching made perfect sense and was entirely accurate.

"Hey !  I got this in the mail yesterday! This is Torche's second-to-last album. It is a really catchy, upbeat kind of sludgemetal-pop hybrid that gets me going like nothing else.  The LP itself is clear vinyl, and is accompanied by a rainbow colored mat that you can actually spot on the cover art in one of the creatures' paw.   The pressing is pretty good, although I feel like there could have been more highs in the mix so that the  sludge  would be defined better.   All in all, I am in love with the packaging, the artwork and the slipmat, and the music is excellent. 10/10 with rice, would buy again.",0,1426886749,vinyl,2,0

Here's my proof, a completely out-of-context and biased report.*  \- **The  I don't agree with your opinion, so here's a downvote  types.** - Bunch of morons who shouldn't be using the site.  \- **Those who get offended easily** - *Hey, don't call that container black! That's offensive.*  \- **The ones who get offended for others** - *I'm white, but I will not stand for you calling that container black!*  \- **The ones who can't take a joke** - What's black and rhymes with Snoop? Dr Dre. *Whine, whine*  That's racist  *complain, cry*  \- ** This. / So much this. / This so much. ** - Leave an upvote and don't bother commenting. Spare me the temptation of committing seppuku.  \- ** My highest rated comment is now about _________ ** - Congratulations. Hold the meaningless edit.  \- ** Stay classy, Reddit. ** - Usually can't stand this word, but it makes me *cringe* so hard to read that.  \- **Any use of the word classy.** - Same as above.  \- ** Faith in humanity restored. ** - This depletes my faith in humanity *shivers*  \- **The ones who think the U.S is the worst country to have ever disgraced the face of the Earth with its existence** - Similar to an earlier section. You're an idiot, that is all.  \- **The ones who are obsessed with Europe** *Bro, Norway and Sweden are so much better than the U.S.* Well, freaking move there if you love them so much.  \- ** It's almost like Reddit is a bunch of different people with different opinions and not a monolithic entity. ** - Thanks for pointing out the obvious with your comment that makes you look dumb and unoriginal.  \- **The ones who complain about how much they dislike memes** - Don't like memes? Downvote them and move on. Don't write a comment crying about it.  \- ** I'm gonna be downvoted to oblivion for this, but... ** -  *Proceeds to get upvoted.*  \- ** This will be buried, but... ** - *Proceeds to get upvoted, gilded*  \- ** Source? ** Shut up.  \- ** FTFY ** - It's okay to fix that for someone, just don't include the  FTFY   \- **Use of the word  SO  or phrase  Significant Other ** - Useful sometimes, but it sounds pretty stupid.  \- **/r/politics**  \- **/r/atheism**  \- **The  religion is the worst  crowd** - *Sees something about religion* Religion is the cancer of the earth, atheism is the best, etc.   \- **Constant whining about vaccines** - Okay, we get it. They don't cause autism. Shut up now.  \- **People who think they're edgy** - Mostly the *U.S, religion, etc. is bad* crowd.  \- **White Knights** - Similar to SJWs, super annoying  \- **The adamantly pro-weed crowd**- No, weed should not be legalized just because you think it should be. Those on the other side have valid opinions, too.  \- **The  weed is harmless  crowd** -  Bro, didn't you hear? Weed cures cancer and AIDS!  You are an idiot.  \- **The  Fox News is bias incarnate  crowd** - Perhaps the biggest hypocrites Reddit has ever seen, they whine about the bias of Fox News while submitting their ThinkProgress articles to /r/politics and watching MSNBC.  #REPOST  **EDIT:** *Insert meaningless grammar/spelling edit we didn't need to know about*  **EDIT:** Well, this blew up.  **EDIT:** RIP my inbox  **EDIT:** Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!",0,1426997988,AskReddit,-3,1

"&gt; Joint prep is the obvious one.  I don't know if you've seen the Technique Thursdays on wrists and shoulders, but that's how I'm currently approaching joint prep, as I believe it's more beneficial to tackle the specifics of each area. I'll keep in mind a general post.  &gt; Loaded mobility exercises, or just mobility in general.  This is seeming like a pretty popular idea, and I can certainly write a bit of fun stuff about that.  &gt; Possibly more of a technique Thursday, but the idea of the handstand being a transition phase and/or foundation for other exercises.  Sounds like an interesting topic, but I may need to get someone else with a little more experience in that field to write it up.  10/10 with rice,   Thank you for your suggestions.",0,1427324935,bodyweightfitness,2,0

"&gt; Mobility  Yep, seems like a popular request.  &gt; Inflammation  Might be straying into medical advice, so it could be a difficult one to navigate and type up.  &gt; Pain  Okay, I think pain is an *amazing* topic and how it relates to movement is pretty important. It's so interesting, there's so much info out there, and a lot of it is cutting edge. The only problem is I don't want to butcher it. Pain is going to be one the key concepts in my master's and I can just imagine myself coming back to read what I'd written now and slamming my palm into my face.  So, uh, gimme a couple of years... :)  &gt; How to deprioritise certain movements, while still making progress in the long term. Maintain strength with minimal work, then focus for a month?

"After reading this thread earlier this afternoon I decided to swing by 333 on my way home at 7:55pm as they were closing shop. I didn't have an appointment, wasn't even aware that they were about to close and with no questions asked the owner of the shop took me in and decided to stay late past closing and give me an outstanding cut. I'm really picky about the way my hair comes out and he was super helpful with his suggestions as I was changing up my look a bit. I was literally blown away by the shop itself as it looks like the kind of place that would charge 50 bucks a haircut just because of how  sheik and modern it is  and being on Huntington Ave, nothing really comes cheap and this place is the exception. I've definitely found my  go to  spot for a good cut and thankfully so. Got the special Northeastern promo price of 15 dollars and left a 5 dollar tip. 20 bucks to look like a new man and walk less than 6 minutes back to my dorm?

"The problem with you people that you do not realize how much effort he put into this.    What you see there is not hours of work, not hours of work because it was formed in his head first, executed poorly first, then made into what you see there.

The buttons are too big m8 I can't r8 8/8, sorry.  and  Lel you so awkward /r/cringe pal     I mean come on. Take a look at the client right now. The landing page is new, barely a year old if I remember correctly. The goddam' profile of yours is from 2010. The leagues tab is 2 years old. It's crap.. And when you are given a fine looking badass job all you can focus on is how this guy is trying to get into the industry so he can work on stuff like this and make it a reality - which to be honest /u/Taiyo4D would be god freaking damn awesome.   But let's just keep bragging about how much he'd like to get a job at Riot and he's being totally awkward about it. I don't care. I'd do the same. And to top it off, the dude who has been a total jerk with his /r/cringe comments probably hasn't contributed to the community at all. This guy at least tried it. He did an awesome job; why does it bother you that he is tryharding for a place at Riot?   Probably couldn't express myself well enough as I'm smashed to the ground at the moment, but to sum it up you guys are like:  We want this, and we want this now  ... a year passes ...  Look, someone did it, it's not official th... wait a minute, this dude has said this and that in his post, haaaaha .  Yea, I hope rito dun hirez this guy, I'd be facepalming myself man .

The entire first portion made it feel real, complete with an exchange of dialogue that would be impossible to write and have conveyed in such a convincing manner. Getting to know the stars as humans, complete with their own trials and tribulations rather than just products for an audiences consumption is something that sets this apart from a lot of the other stuff out there.

"The story began last weekend.  I'm not a HUGE fan of Mickey D, but I have to admit that the Jalapeno (I always make an effort to forcefully pronounce the  J ) Double is actually pretty dang good. I walked in and saw that one of my friends was working the counter, so I decided to mess with him a bit.  I've always been interested in knowing just how large of a sandwich McDonalds would serve, so I asked for a **J**alapeno Quadruple. I didn't actually want the sandwich, I just wanted to know how much it would cost.  My friend, I should note, is Mexican (this comes into play later). He couldn't figure out how to add the two extra patties, so he went to ask his manager about it. He walked up to her, and inquired about sprucing up this **J**alapeno (he forwent his Mexican instincts and said it the way that I always do) Double.  He came back so embarrassed that he forced me to order the Jalapeno Quadruple. He was seriously worried (probably frivolously) that he would be fired. As much as I didn't want the burger, I have to admit that I ended up eating the whole thing.  5/10  4/10 with rice would not Jalapeno again.  [Pic for proof](http://i.imgur.com/lqpCaT0.jpg)  Edit: I know the pic looks like it only has 3 patties. I actually started ranting at my friend that there were only 3 until he pointed out the last one (hidden under the one that sticks out unusually far). Even for a reluctant burger-orderer, I'm pretty particular about customer service.",0,1427867415,AskReddit,1,0

Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10. 10/10 with rice xd, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F  about tree fiddy  was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as  NOPE NOPE NOPE ? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad.

Ghazi's only purpose is to tear down and slander a legitimate consumer dispute while PCMR makes light of the eternal internal gaming debate of best platform, they have taken a side and argue for it ad absurdum.

"First time I was in my mid '20s. For my birthday, she convinced another girl to come home with us. It was pretty clear that the other girl was more interested in her than me, so that made my role kind of awkward. I played a bit with the other, but ultimately satisfied my girl as she played with the other. Then I finished and they kept going. 4/10. Maybe 5/10 with rice.  Next time was in my 30s. We discussed the idea of open relationships, swinging, threesomes, etc for quite a while and finally decided to dip our toes in the water. I figured it would make it easier for her if I allowed another guy. Turned out, it was easier for everyone. Two guys can do more for one girl than anything one guy thinks he can do for two. 10/10, would (and have) done again.  After that, we had a rather exciting and fun swinging relationship for several months, which then grew until a combination of swinging and open-bounds, and lasted about another year. Ultimately, we weren't really right for each other, and I think we were both staying in it longer than we should, just because we both loved the sex so much.",0,1428094106,AskReddit,88,0

"If any of the Scions survived, it's Minifilia and Yda.   We dont see ANYTHING happen to Minifilia, and as the figure-head, they'd probably wish to capture her and execute her publically. We never see her fight, with either magic or weapons through out the game, so I doubt they killed her in cold-blood. And her Echo came back.   Yda and Papalymo's LB3 was awesome, which makes me think they surivived, though I could see the exertion of the LB3 for someone other than the Warrior of Light killing them, or the ensuing destruction hurting/killing them.   Y'sholta and Thancred sacrificed themselves to collapse the passage. Their survival is iffy at best, though I wouldn't be suprised if Thancred or both survived because of a quick protect cast, or some Thancred ninja skills.   I dont think ALL of them will survive.

"Dane here, I'm on it:  1) Get pork chops to feed your household. Make sure they don't have too much fat on them.   2) Fry them a light brown on a pan in a tad of whatever you Americans fry stuff in, we use margerine here, but I suppose you can use oil. Not olive, though.   3) While frying, season with salt and pepper, a tad more than you would ordinary chops. **Save the fat**, but take the chops out and let them rest a bit.   4) Chop some (2-3) leek, a bell pepper, an onion, mix it, and put half of that in a stoneware tray or other oven-proof cooking dish.   5) Put the browned chops on the veggies *and half a can of chopped tomato* in the tray.   6) Put the rest of the veggies and tomato over the pork chops.   7) Pour a quarter liter (about a quarter quart for the metric-impaired) of full cream over the pork chop fat in your pan, stir it and let it bubble for a few secs, then pour it over the veggies and chops in the oven tray.   8) Put the tray with the chops in the oven at medium heat for about 40 min.   9) 8/10 dish, 10/10 with rice. So cook rice while you wait for the dish to finish.  [The resulting dish looks something like these when finished.](https://www.google.com/search?q=koteletter+i+fad+med+ris&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=mCuxwWGbARpIaM%253A%253BVZlsp3ui2PmbZM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.dk-kogebogen.dk%25252Fopskrift2%25252Fvisopskrift.php%25253Fid%2525253D9607&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=mCuxwWGbARpIaM%253A%252CVZlsp3ui2PmbZM%252C_&amp;usg=__s9ZI9Zu3XezIRGOgR3LNuoY28g0%3D&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=900&amp;ved=0CCoQyjc&amp;ei=GVcfVc-5NMGcsAHy-4HoDw#imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=0E6dTFG6HrkDAM%253A%3BvP32mgZvtHD5eM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcdn.arla.dk%252FFiles%252F597082499%252F6a7c474b-0380-42c6-8804-db8ecee06d7d.jpg%253Fpreset%253DMain%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.arla.dk%252Fopskrifter%252Fkoteletter-og-bacon-i-fad-%252F%3B430%3B269) You can substitute a lot of the veggies with something else.

It has been awesome and fun for us both, and we get off watching the other please and be pleased by multiple partners. It supercharges our sexual encounters for weeks after, reliving the experience, and we are as much in love and secure as the day we married. We both feel very sexual and sensual and lust after one another regularly, despite having two kids, jobs, mortgage, and the same stress as everyone else.

"It has no outstanding bugs from my usage, meaning that it has the usual 5.0.x bugs like having cleared installation pages in the app switcher, the sync icon being stuck in the accounts page etc.  It's pretty stable. I did experience an automatic reboot once, but I do have Xposed modules running, so I can't say whether the ROM caused that reboot.  Features wise, you get the Dot View functionality. You get to make use of the depth sensor and HTC's photo app to change the focus of a picture. The IR blaster also works flawlessly.  You get to choose whether to enable swipe to wake or double tap to wake on the initial installation process. It's been working without any problems so far.  I did get an odd slowdown once, but that happens on a Nexus 5 before 5.1, so there's that.  Speed has been rather consistent.  I do not have a SIM card yet (my second SIM has yet to be cut to nano size) but battery life is fantastic.  TL;DR You still get to use the hardware features of the camera and IR blaster, performance and battery life is fantastic, and it's stable overall.

"I bought my **Viper** after lusting after them since the '96 coupe was shown on the auto show circuit. I was 8 or 9 years old then, so I collected any and all Viper models I could get my hands on and any of my friends knew that was my dream car. I had a short affair with the idea of a GT40 at about 13 years old, but the Viper has always been #1. I even was looking through old HS yearbooks and someone commented on it when they signed my yearbook! And then I got one a couple of years out of college. I'm extremely sad to report that some of the magic has worn off. In a good and a bad way...  I've learned that sometimes ultimate speed is not the most fun. It's an extremely common misconception that speed and power automatically = **FUN**. And that's definitely true to an extent. But, woe is me, when my internal speed racer is itching for a hit, I can't really satisfy it with the Viper before my internal  oh shit I can go straight to jail at these speeds  voice chimes in. First gear goes to 60 in the blink of an eye. I think 120 or 130 in third. So what I really want to do, what I crave to do, is blast down a back road, wide open throttle. And then I do. But half way down the road I've doubled the speed limit and it's getting irresponsible. So I shut it down and use the rest of the back road to coast down to the speed limit. The analogy is basically premature ejaculation. At the end of it all you’re left thinking that wasn’t entirely as satisfying as you hoped and you wish you could enjoy it more. I'm left going, OK... Now what? It's a similar syndrome for the corners, because the Viper has *so much* capability that testing it on the street is pretty irresponsible because if something goes wrong, it will go wrong in a big way. I don't think the Viper is as scary as the magazines make it out to be, it doesn't behave as if it has a mind of its own, it is predictable. But, it's so, so capable and once you pass those capabilities due to your own error you won't just slide off into the gravel on the shoulder, you'll slide into the next state over.   So I've gained an appreciation for slow cars having owned the Viper. Sounds strange but true. And going slow in a Viper is a total tease.   I also don't see it on as much of a pedestal. I don't see almost any car up on a pedestal anymore, except some of the really rare stuff. The Viper has given me access to see so many other supercars (strange how that works), often enough that during one particular day I saw a lambo on the highway and didn't really react because I just got back from a Cars and Coffee and a Ferrari and McLaren dealer with my friends in an Exige, Elise, M3 and Corvette. Because it IS just a car - they all are just (really cool, great, excellent) machines. My Viper needs maintenance just like any other car, and it's controls are just like any other manual car, and if you wreck it you’ll need to fix it just like any other car (except you’ll also have to pay the Viper tax = $$$$$).  In the beginning of ownership, I almost had a heart attack when I let my father drive it and I am ashamed of that - he is a huge part of the reason I even have a Viper because he taught me about cars. And I didn't even want to let him drive it because I was too paranoid. How terrible, to have this and not share it? That paranoia has worn off, thankfully, and now I'm glad to be free of that burden, because that is what putting a car on a pedestal really is: a burden. It then becomes something you have to protect, and how can you really enjoy something if you're constantly reminded that it's risky, or that you might incur damage?  It already has rock chips on it and some squeaks, and I felt like *I* was not a good owner for having a less-than-mint Viper. But now that I see it as less of a dream and more of a real car that I can use, I am getting adjusted to the fact that this isn’t the best Viper out there and that’s a good thing because I can use it, depreciate it, and feel less guilt.   I’ve never tracked it, but absolutely will this year. I am really looking forwards to that, to see if it changes my appreciation for the car. I hope I can finally feed my speed demon.  So, **TL:DR:** It's better because I’ve realized it’s just a car and I am not afraid to use it &amp; share it with other gear heads. It’s worse because now the dream is real so by definition, it’s no longer a dream car.   All in all, 10/10 would do again. 11/10 with rice, snakes love rice. ",0,1428416662,cars,8,0

"&gt;  I've learnt to just not care about any kind of insults  I just picked up this mentality. Everytime someone gets into those deep flamings and they pick one or two persons I just say something very stupid about it, probably using a bit of sarcasm and a big fcking XD at the end of my sentence. Believe me or not , it makes ppl flame less. The flamer realizes that he is dumb for flaming in a game and the flamed ones realize that its a game where a stranger is flaming them ... who cares ? nobody , lets win.  Btw, Im agreeing with everything you said in the post. In S2 when I was watching high elo players streaming I realized how super good their english is.

"This is yes, pretty much what Bungie is doing. While I agree with these people that the raid was never confirmed, people assumed, and for good reason. But that's beyond the point.  This is exactly what Bungie is doing. It's an endless cycle of hype and letdown. On the box for Destiny, it promises 'rich, cinematic storytelling.' My foot.  It will always be this way with Destiny, and I personally don't believe this game is worth all the hype. Everybody can have their opinion, but this game isn't what it should be.

"* before any comments, I'd like to share this [tweet](https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/587980415350112256).    * Apparently subin wrote all the songs which was really impressive, she's a 94-liner too   * I like To Darling but I think it could have been better if it was less hectic. It's a really sweet and chill song, I think it would have been better if they made it a bit simpler and cut down a bit on the drums actually. Wonder how it'd sound with just a bit of acoustic guitar/piano   * I think Joker is an alright song. It's consistent in it's tone but the concept, dance and the melody just don't stand out to me. A bit disappointing.    * 홀려 was my favorite song. It was a little funky which I liked. This album just doesn't stand out to me much and while that may be something to criticize, others may like their style. 홀려 in particular had a bit of a jazzy feel to it. I think Dal Shabet has sleeper talent, like good looks, talented artists, and decent singers but they don't showcase it well. For example, I wish they went further with the concept of their songs and experimented more, like making 홀려 even more jazzy/funky. A lot of the songs sound different from each other but it seems like they lack a lot of power (I'm Not could be a really badass song if they emphasized the rap and then a more EDM-like background with a strong chorus) or a general concept of the group?    * 5/10 but 6/10 with rice",0,1429074506,kpop,7,0

"Well. Let's look at the facts. 20,000 images... Or rather 20k. K is the 11th letter of the alphabet. 20k - 11k = 9k. This man is a father who likes to rub his children awkwardly.

In WW2 some people in their infantry would use 22mm rifle grenades. 22. People is plural for person. Person= Singular= 1. 22-1= 21. 9 + 10= 21. This father has not touched a woman in 21 years.

"How does one smoothly shave a vagina? I use Summer's Eve, a very sharp razor and single upward strokes to shave, put I still have tiny hairs leftover AND get red bumps afterwards!  Also how do you get rid of the bumps?  Edit: Huh, this took off. Let me just save you the trouble and put down the most common responses I've been getting, so you don't have to root through the comments.  1) If you can, go get it waxed.  2) If you can't/you are scared to, use coconut oil to prep it.  3) Can't afford coconut oil? Nice conditioner! Just male sure to keep it away from anything but your pubes.  4) Shave WITH the grind.  5) You can't afford a waxing AND are afraid to shave? Buy Nair, if you don't have sensitive skin.  Edit:  I just tried coconut oil, shaving with the grain. My vagina feels like Varys the Spider's forehead, but still has stubble. And now my razor is completely dull. 5/10 with rice thank you for your suggestion  Edit:  FUCK IT I'm just going to go laser this shit off. Because getting shot by lasers sounds way cooler than shaving.  Also coconut oil feels amazing on your kitch. Definitely a must for sexytime!  Edit:  HOLYFUCKINGSHIT lasers are expensive.

Pasta: Add pasta sauce and/or canned diced tomatoes to chicken and your favorite pasta.  Can be improved with sauted onions/garlic.

Instead of  legs,  the UT-AT featured 16 low-power repulsorlift skis that would shift to properly balance the vehicle depending on the terrain. Four additional repulsorlift plates were located under the main carriage for propulsion. The skis also had the ability to reverse their repulsion, causing gription fields and allowing the vehicle to ascend sheer surfaces if needed. The skis supplied superior stability when firing, and were particularly effective on unstable terrain.   &gt;Although the skis canceled out the weight of the vehicle, it was still difficult to maneuver due to its significant inertial mass. This limited the recommended speed of the craft to 45 kilometers per hour. The skis were blast-proof, which made them invulnerable to light blaster fire, but not to explosive charges. A significant amount of heat was generated by the undulating plates, which was compensated for by an air vent located towards the front of the vehicle.   &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/GDqGyr8.png) [^(i)](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140430180744/starwars/images/8/8d/Eras-legends.png) &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/u3oMmrr.jpg) [^(i)](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100818194356/starwars/images/0/0d/UT-AT_sides.jpg) &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/7EdkeV5.jpg) [^(i)](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090124014414/starwars/images/f/f7/Ventress_vs_UT-AT.jpg) &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/NNebgU6.jpg) [^(i)](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130215051632/starwars/images/1/17/UTAT_Mygeeto.png) &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/75KU9z1.jpg) [^(i)](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100818192932/starwars/images/2/21/UT-AT.jpg) &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/xSmhiEn.jpg) [^(i)](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080121061130/starwars/images/3/36/UTAT.jpg) &gt;^Interesting: [^All ^Terrain ^Armored ^Transport](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Armored Transport) ^| [^All ^Terrain ^Scout ^Transport](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Scout Transport) ^| [^All ^Terrain ^Experimental ^Transport](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Experimental Transport) ^| [^All ^Terrain ^Scout ^Transport/Assault](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All Terrain Scout Transport/Assault)   ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqigsp1) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqigsp1)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikiabot/wiki/index) ^|  [^Source](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py)  ^(Please note this bot is in testing.

"You need to learn the story of the man and the seed. It all began with a man buying seeds from the local shopkeeper. The merchant said that these seeds were extra special. When the man got back home with the seeds, he noticed they were a bright green. He planted the seeds and waited weeks for them to grow. One day he woke up and saw that the seeds have grown into a large beautiful flower the size of a tree. He ran to get his flip flops on and get dressed to see this magical event. He walked up to the flower and stared when suddenly the flower caught on fire. The man ran for a bucket of water but it was to late. He started to cry but then noticed that there was a paper on the ground. He walked up to the paper and read the writing. After reading it,he ran inside and committed seppuku.

"I'm 17, been playing games as long as I can remember. I thoroughly enjoyed the last MK, the gore didn't bother me at all- it wouldn't be MK without it. MKX... it's like they're trying too hard. They used to make them as over the top and ridiculous as possible, but it seems like they're moving towards just making them as gory as they can. Just look at the examples someone posted above:  &gt;Bubble Head: Cassie draws her pistol and shoots her opponent's kneecaps, forcing them down onto their knees, then shoots them in the head. As her opponent's reels and blood spills from their head wound, Cassie walks up to them, pops her gum, then sticks the wad onto the bullet hole in their head, with blood filling the gum up into a balloon, and then pops, splattering blood on their face before they collapse dead. (MKX)  Nothing to write home about but I'd consider it a pretty good fatality. Could be better, 7/10 with rice.  &gt;Selfie: Cassie draws her nightstick and hits her opponent's jaw with enough force to break it and leave it dangling from one side. As her victim starts to fall, Cassie grabs her opponent, pulls out her mobile phone and takes a picture of herself and her jaw-broken victim together in a  selfie.  She sends the photo to a social media site called  Friendships  where other users are seen commenting on it (some of whom appear to be other Mortal Kombat X characters; different comments appear every time). (MKX)  Wtf is this? Honestly? She just arbitrarily breaks the dudes jaw because hey, that'll look shocking, and takes a picture with him? The comments are kinda funny but other than that it's an awful excuse for a fatality.  I think they're trying to be as edgy as possible because they know that controversy sells, and that nobody relevant is going to review a goddamn Mortal Kombat game and say it's too gory, because that reviewer would be laughed at.  That said, the game is fun as fuck, I just hope the next one focuses more on what MK has always been- a good fighting game laden with ridiculous, over the top gore- rather than a good fighting game with gore.",0,1429660738,gaming,1,0

"I understand about the LKQ, it's basically the main gripe people have when they have an insurance claim. A lot of people don't take the time to read and understand what type of insurance they're paying for when they get an auto policy.  Here's the thing, no insurance company will ever put OEM parts on a vehicle that's not less than a year old (sometimes 2) or has less than 15k miles.  If your car ain't new, why does it get new parts?  The only exception is if that insured specifically purchased an OEM endorsement on their insurance policy, which is available at most standard insurance companies.  Safe Auto and The General, Non-Standard companies, won't offer this endorsement, but all the big ones typically do.  Also, adding to the LKQ argument, there's a LKQ plant in Columbus and they do a damn fine job.  They would be out of a job quickly if they sold crappy parts to insurance companies.  If you are unfortunate enough to have an insurance claim, look closely at the estimate that's written.  Those LKQ parts are lifetime guaranteed the majority of the time.  I worked as an insurance adjuster for a few years at two different insurance companies in Columbus and have had both good and bad experiences with 3C.  They have a few bad practices where it felt like they were money grabbing from the insurance company.  Mainly the LKQ part you bring up, which 90% of the time the insurance company still won't pay for and it's on the customer/insured to cover the difference.  Never dealt with the Bob character, but there were a few decent people I've worked with there - the receptionist not being one of them - but ultimately i felt like they hindered the claim, and the relationship between the Insurer (there to help no matter what you may think) and the Insured.  Mainly, by telling the Insured how an insurance claim works, building false pretenses, when the Insurer is telling the customer how the process really works and the fastest scenario to get you paid and your car on the road.  Insurance companies lose money the longer claims are kept open.  They were by far, in all of the body shops in all of the states I've worked with, the most difficult body shop to deal with.  Not even mad, but impressed.  1/10 with rice.",0,1429704018,Columbus,3,0

"You know what's hysterical? I went to high school with the author, photographer and subject of that article.   Hailley went to Delphi with me, but was a bit older. Her high school boyfriend was named Hubbard, but no relation. She married another Delphi grad, had kids right away, and they stayed on that little hill in Oregon, pretty much ever since. They are more excluded from everyday life than I ever was in the Sea Org.  Sarah, the photographer, came from a wealthy Nebraska family. Her brother was John Travolta's personal assistant for years. Her and her sister were both (and still are) very, very bangable. Seriously, volleyball girls. 10/10. 12/10 with rice. She also married a Delphi alum right out of high school and starting having kids.  Come to think of it, so did the brother.  Tad, the author, was the same age as Hailley. His mother was a course room supervisor at Delphi, and Tad himself played baseball. I didn't know him well, mainly because he was handsome and popular and I was not.  His mom was super cool though.

"I like it- which is cool because I didn't like the last 2 songs, but I only like its *sounds*, he's a good DJ. However, just like the second song, which I absolutely loathed, The music seems not to do with the video, or even FNaF, at all. The video itself was good, but there was too much repetitiveness.    *purple guy swings, animatronic don't like it, purple man swings, animatronic don't like it, purple man swings, struggling animatronic foot, purple man swings, animatronic don't like it, purplr man swings, dismembered hand, repeat.*   Also that cog and screw thing looked unnecessary.   overall, Video in all : 5/10   Video alone : 7/10   Song alone : 8/10   -5/10 with rice (broke my fucking monitor, the greasy rice did.)

"We went on Thanksgiving many years ago.  It was a great atmosphere, friendly but obnoxious crowd.  The worst part was the NFL chosen halftime  entertainment .  John Fogerty did a publicity stunt and played at all three games that day and KC was the last one.  It took forever to set up the stage, he had no energy and was out of it.  Just overall no fun.

"Not Philippines, but china. You might still be interested in a read.  After my parents divorce, my dad had a mail order bride from china. Half his age and very pretty. I was 16 or so at the time. Lets just start off saying it takes a lot of paperwork and documentation to get someone in the country. They talked online for about 6 months before she moved over. My dad visited china first and i think they actually got married there. It's really unclear. Now for the interesting part. She arrives.  My dad has an alcohol collection and was showing her some of it. He turns his back to get something else in the kitchen and she pours a 8oz glass and downs it. She wound up saying she loved everyone, especially our hair. She was fascinated with American hair that night... until the second wave of drunkenness set in where she was crying and screaminf saying my  dad loved my mother and my mother was prettier than her. Good first impression. My mom caught word od this incident and said she was uncomfortable with her kids being around that behavior. My step mother was banned from alcohol.   My father also had a long time friend, Norm, who resided in china (black man with a lovely chinese wife). They homestayed at my house for a good 3 months, and during the process, Norm's wife made us meals as a thank you for hospitality. She made the best damn breakfast ever. They slept in the trailer we had, so they had their privacy in that aspect. I respected Norm a lot. He helped out wherever he could and had a great positive outlook in life. Eventually, my fathers wife got jealous and started hiding things around the house saying that Norm was stealing. Against my and my siblings protests, he believed her. Eventually he confronted Norm, and Norms response was  I think its time for me to leave.  Ive never seen him since.  Life continued as normal, and eventually, we were looking through some high cupboards and found one of the  stolen  items conveniently wrapped up in a paper towel. Even though my dad never admitted to being wrong, i think this was the turning point. One night, my dad's wife let out a shriek in the middle of the night (from the living room). This woke me up to my dad saying  Julie! You cant yell like that in the night. People are sleeping!  I tried to get back to sleep, and about 10 mins later i saw police lights. Apparenlty she took off into the street with a knife and my dad called the cops on her. We were henceforth banned from going to my dads house for as long as Julie was there.  Now comes for the divorce. Julie started trying to claim abuse and whatnot, including trying to say that I was responsible for an old injury in her knee. The doctor said the force required to do that damage was that of a nfl linebacker tackling her... i was a 115 pound boy. Not quite NFL status. Still. Domestic abuse charges are hard to fight against. But my dad had a keylogger on his computer which caught Julie asking a friend in an email  how to get a green card exemption by filing for abuse.  The judge threw out that case. Still my dad had to prove marriage fraud separately which is hard to do, given how hard it is to get someone in the country to begin with. Eventually my dad had to make $700 rent payments for Julie for 3 years or something. It was hard on us as a family and we almost lost our house.  Not a pleasant experience 3/10 would not do again. 5/10 with rice.  Tl;dr: she went from 0 to 8oz real quick, framed a black man for stealing, took off into the street with a knife, turned me into a NFL superstar, and pissed off a judge with an email... and still managed to get her way.",0,1429972923,AskReddit,175,0

You won't escape even if you move upst8 on the interst8 to a frozen est8 near the Bering Str8 and learn to icesk8 in figure 8s. It won't allevi8 even if I were to w8. It'd be my longest h8 to d8. You couldn't even rel8 to my pain, m8, even if you medit8. It wouldn't transl8. I aw8 the new banner of G-8. It will be the subreddit's defining tr8. It'll be worth it's w8 in reddit gold, m8. G-8 would be the best banner to d8. Don't leave this idea trapped in a cr8. When we clear the sl8, we'll need G-8. It will be better than the banners that pred8. Just w8 for it m8, and you'll r8 G-8 8/8.  TL;DR I would appreci8 a banner of G-8.",0,1429976695,OnePiece,17,0

"Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F  about tree fiddy  was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as  NOPE NOPE NOPE ? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

I agree 100%, this movie is like a modern day Citizen Kane, making masterful use of cinematography to emphasis the absurdity that drives the hilarity in Blart's life. It is a meditation on our conceptions of humour and how it relates to American ideals, and should, I believe, be studied for the intense gravitas it brings to a medium that was sorely lacking.

"Hullo chaps!   Saturday was the day of my little brother's confirmation, so of course I decided to go out drinking with my mate once the party had ended. As usual we went to Highlanders Bar (great place w/ 150 whiskies and 60+ beers). My mate was paying the first round, so I decided that we were having BenRiach Solstice. Also, I know the bartender, so we got double pours. Or, well, bigger pours than the other customers. Perhaps it was because we were suited up, but whatever.   I have been keen on trying this for a while, so I had high expectations for it! Here's what I got. Skål!  #BenRiach Solstice, 17 y/o, 50% abv, NCA+NCF - 2nd Edition# _____   **Colour:**   *I usually don't include colour, mainly because I don't give a shit (except for Dalmore; fuck those guys), but this was absolutely gorgeous! I'm sure that IGN would r8 it 8/8 m8.*   **Nose:**   *Port, peat, smokey wood, red grapes, ripe red plum, berries, thick jam.*   Wow, quite fruity and thick. I was already a bit tipsy (blame it on martinis) and it was in a bar, so I feel like I didn't get the full experience. Still good.   **Taste:**   *Plums, port, peat, salt, malt, strawberries - the artificial kind, vegetal and earthy.*   It has a rather nice, oily mouthfeel, and it is very gentle for being 50% alcohol. Yummy!   **Finnish?:**   *No I'm Danish. Joking aside, peaty and salty leaving a bit of the strawberry jam.*   The finish is where the peat really shines. It's not the ravaging peat of Laphroaig, nor is it the bonfire of Lagavulin. It's more like a combination of the salty peat of Talisker and the sharpness of Ardmore. Not that long of a finish, though. This is what disappointed me.  _____ It's a damn good whisky. There's something about the finish, though, but I still love it. I'm gonna give it  #92/100# ___ **Postscript:**  So, my mate and I met with a couple of my  high-roller, big-spender  type friends after finishing our Bennies. Now, I have a rep on the high-school for being that guy with the scotch. So naturally, I wanted scotch. I spotted some Laphroaig QC, and ordered two pours in cognac glasses. The price was about $10 for 2cl, but it was a good place, and not too bad compared to the usual prices. Welp, this bartender girl had no concept of 2cl, so she poured about 6cl. Nice!   I immediately saw the potential in this, so after finishing the froggy, I ordered a dram of the HP21 that was hiding on the shelf. A dram was $20, but I persuaded her into giving me half a dram for $10. Lo and behold, she poured me a massive dram again, and satisfied my scotch craving for the night.  __ Cheers for reading my rambling and my review! Have a good one, chaps!",0,1430234419,Scotch,10,0

"This is really, really good so these are all little niggles, but on the whole fantastic job!  It's nice that you varied on i - VI - iv - V, but I think you could maybe vary it a bit more in the bit where the bassline is really prominent? It's the simplest part of your track and it's kind of unnerving how pop it is in contrast to the (excellently jazzy and awesomely counter-intuitive) rest. Vocals are cool, samples work really well to loosen the whole thing up, production is tight (though maybe the kick a bit loud? It's not my favourite kick in the world but if that's what you're going for, go for it!).   Also, the bit where your pitched-up vocal is paralleling your main one - could maybe make it a bit more the way it happens [in James Blake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBcCXX0aWhc) or in [Mumdance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaG2RyDxQlk)? I.e. crisp, pitched-down, rather than hazy and in the background. It'd maybe make the vocal a bit more alien which I'd see working well, but yeah, it works really well already and it's up to you :)  i r8 8/8 gr8 b8 m8 no h8",0,1430674569,futurebeatproducers,1,0

"No, I stopped going; simply out-grew it, and even if I didn't the $117 price tag for a table spot simply isn't worth it because you'll get just that - a measly table spot. If you plan on eating on site you're looking at $5 for [one of those shitty pizzas I mentioned earlier](http://www.laurenbkirchner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1010923.jpg), and with the sleeping halls usually being occupied you'll have to sleep at your computer which is not only uncomfortable (you're not allowed to sleep under the table, even though it's your fucking spot you paid over $100 for) but also close to impossible since they blast loud EDM music during the whole event. * But... what makes it worth? *, you may ask. * Surely the gaming aspect is an up-side, since it's essentially a huge gaming convention? * Well, yes and no.   The live artist performances are great, but they're located in the biggest hall of them all - [D hallen](http://www.techsweden.org/forum/uploads/monthly_06_2013/ccs-17481-0-55429800-1371310189.jpg) - and it's extremely hard to get a good main-stage spot unless you actually pay for a seat in the same hall. If you do chose to sit in D-hallen, however, people will bump into the back on your chair *all the fucking time* because it's always crowded, which not only makes gaming sessions extremely unenjoyable but also pisses you off to a point where you'll almost pop an artery. The other halls are pretty good if you actually plan on playing games without having your focus interrupted every few minutes, but then you'll run into the issue I mentioned earlier - not getting a descent spot for the artist performances, which really is a huge downside.   The tournaments held are presumably good, since you'll have to fork over *even more* dollaridoos if you want to attend them. The exhibition halls, on the other hand, are excellent and executed perfectly - hands-on play with soon-to-be released games, meeting many gaming e-celebrities you have a hard-on for, and loads of free swag. Sadly one trip to the exhibition halls are usually enough to satisfy your needs since you can cover it all in one day.  DreamHack gets my rating of: **2/10**, and **-9000/10 with rice** because it probably would be overpriced and taste like ass. The rating would rise to **3/10** if I didn't, during my last visit, got seated next to an obese neckbeard who not only occupied his spot, but also half of mine.",0,1430806552,justneckbeardthings,9,0

"This is what Anti-GamerGate actually believes. That's amazing. How much koolaid has Kameron Hurley been drinking?  They genuinely see GG as a group of 300 white, heterosexual, male, doxxing, raping, bro-fisting, backwards-hatted, woman-hating, slaving, poor-hating, gay-bashers.  But since nothing about transphobia was mentioned, as is required by The Narrative against GamerGate, I have no choice but to wonder if Kameron sympathizes with the transphobic. ^/s  Choice passages:  &gt;“Democracy? A few hundred people create dummy accounts and thousands of fake digital IDs, blowing themselves up like pufferfish to look larger than they are...”   'GamerGate is 300 people!'  &gt;Sorva held her tongue. She had once watched a colleague of hers, a female developer, stripped bare by her male colleagues and doused with a keg of beer.   We'd all be sex offenders, oh, if only we had the chance!  &gt;In addition to married households consisting of one man, one woman, up to three mistresses, and six children, it is also permissible to include families with just four children now. Very generous, that change.  We're apparently for... polygamy? What? Someone's pet issues are showing. How precious.  &gt;You are absolutely free to write about whatever religion you’d like. There are a half dozen Christian denominations that are CEO-approved.  We're Christians, too? Since when has GG ever had an interest in Christianity? If anything most people here overlap with the atheists who fought off Atheism+.  &gt;“Yet this is the fourth year you’ve submitted ineligible work,” Marken said. “Are you stupid? Were your parents poor or gay or something?”  That's funny, it always looks like the prominent Anti-GG people are the ones who come from lives of privilege and wealth, typically cliquing it up in San Francisco. But yeah, we're rollin' in fat stacks of cash.  They've successively Otherized GamerGate by every single metric they could, applying everything they dislike to it to the point of absurdity. Anti-GG really are fighting their own imaginary monsters.  I legitimately hope this story is gr8 b8, if so I rate 8/8. If it's a serious satire of GamerGate, I rate 'seek medication for your delusions'.  **EDIT** Before anyone claims this is some Pro-GG satire or just a troll fanfic, this is a Hugo winner. The author is this person. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kameron_Hurley  The story is hosted on Vice Motherboard.

"Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F  about tree fiddy  was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as  NOPE NOPE NOPE ? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as  YOU HAD ONE JOB . I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh.

"Norton had no idea what was coming. He had kept his mousing fingers on the pulse of what was going on outside but still didn't have the nerve to cross his threshold. All his life, all that had ever come from going out there was pain and mental anguish. Bullies, unsympathetic catcalls from the popular crowd, up-turned lunch trays and wedgies; always the wedgies... Life wasn't particularly easy when you were 168cm tall (5' 6  to the Imperial heathens!), built like you were made out of toothpicks, and could mentally out-wrestle anyone in the room. The world outside was not a world for him.   It was a day he would never forget. About two months after the virus had taken its toll, he was posting on his favourite forum, completely unaware of the large vehicles rolling up outside of his house. He had just hit  save  when the front door splintered in. He let out a high-pitched squeal as he turned to see a squad of soldiers come rushing in. He put up his hands, half in surrender, half for protection (whatever measure they would do...) before opening his eyes and turning to take a second look.   They were all women. Every. Single. One of them. They didn't look like bombshells or the girls he would never admit to looking at on the internet. They all scanned the room, pointing their weapons to the corners, one covering their entrance.    Clear!  One shouted and got a chorus of 'clears' in return. The leader then approached him with a confident gait. She had the stride typical of the bullies in school. Confident, collected, prone to violence. Norton recoiled and tucked himself into a half-ball in his rolling chair, preparing himself for the blow.    Norton Nathaniel Theodore Virous?  she stated, stopped a half-step away from him. Norton opened his eyes and lowered his arms.    Y-yes?     Package secured. Prep for transport,  the leader spat into her radio and set her team into motion. The sound of rotors started to become clear outside.  Sir,  she stated, looking him up and down,  you're going to have to come with me.  She took him by the hand and mostly dragged him through the hole they had made to get to him. A chopper was already on the lawn, befuddling the remaining neighbours. She shoved him into the back of the helo, boarded it herself and slammed the door closed. As they lifted off, Norton finally got enough gumption to speak.    Where are we going?  He couldn't even make eye contact with the squad leader across from him.    Classified. All you need to know is you have been brought under the protection of the United States government as part of Project Easter.  She took her helmet off and Norton finally got a clear look at her. An honest 8/10, 9/10 with rice.    Project Easter?     Government project to start repopulating the country. And boy,  she started to take her uniform off,  We're going to fuck like rabbits.    ______________      *Norton, no one is ever going to believe that.*   *Shut up, it's my story.

"I've had it for about a week. I tech my own guns and my squad's stuff, so I've been inside a gearbox or two. ICS's piston seems to be made out of the same sort of POM material as the lonex upgrade pistons I typically put in guns aftermarket. Teeth are half metal, instead of just the release tooth. I like that. The other, non-proline ICS guns don't come with this piston. Gears are quiet, indicates a good factory shim job. Rotary hop up unit moves smoothly and has some resistance to it, but not an unnecessary amount. Should prevent hop from coming loose. Hop up unit is also metal, not plastic. The rear wiring setup is very nice, comes with an automotive blade fuse and the wires are routed underneath the buffer tube to give you max battery space. In the crane stock variant, you can easily fit either a large 11.1 or multiple smaller 11.1's in parallel. Mine chronos very consistently at 355 with .28's, math says that's roughly 370 with .25's. Fire rate isn't amazing, but isn't slouchy either.  Externally the gun rates 10/10. It is built like a fucking brick. The receivers are very beefy, lots of extra metal all over to match the real steel PAR series. Makes the airsoft version very satisfying to hold. The gun is also made out of CNC'd aluminum vs the crappy pot metal of most metal AEG's. The pistol grip is very comfy.  Overall, I r8 8/8.",0,1430958782,airsoft,2,0

"Nuclear engineering student here. Answer is yes, much higher than you are *supposed* to be getting from an x-ray machine. Granted, it's not going to give you insta-cancer, but it isn't *good* for you and I would not recommend it as part of your morning routine.   The x-ray machine you go thru at an airport uses supper low quantities of radiation as it's only made to go thru clothes and maybe a bit of your skin. Baggage x-ray machines are made to penetrate most metals to some degree, so the dosage is much higher. The worst x-ray machines are the ones your checked baggage goes thru. They use a metric fuckton of radiation in comparison as they are designed to process baggage much faster. In order to do that, they need to turn up the dosage.  Kinda like taking a picture with a film camera, you need a faster shutter speed and your film (x ray sensor) isn't any more sensitive, so you have to up the quantity of x-rays being generated in the same period of time (Same as turning the F-stop lower on your camera to get more light in).   Speaking of film, never put it in a checked bag, the x-ray machine will expose the film. That's how strong it is.  **TL;DR 4/10, 9/10 with rice (Would not recommend)**",0,1431113824,worldnews,8,0

"Man, what a show!   We also missed most of Delain. We got in the doors about half way through their set, which was a bummer, since this would have been my first exposure to the band. The last couple of songs I liked quite a bit, so I'll check them out.  Sabaton was just as good as I remember them to be, and the crowd showed their love for them by chanting  SABATON!! SABATON!!  between each song. Lots of energy and shenanigans from the band, for sure! And of course, they pulled up a seven year old on stage and the crowd chanted his name. Poor kid looked terrified. Hahaha!!  This was my first time ever seeing Nightwish live and the experience was wonderful. The band was incredibly tight and on point with every song, and Floor and the new drummer (Kai..?) nailed every part perfectly. The Poet and the Pendulum was so very well done, and I'm glad they even played the mellow part at the end of the song. Marco playing The Islander and the crowd singing along gave me goosebumps. Fantastic. They ended the show with The Greatest Show on Earth, Ghost Opera Song, and Last Ride of the Day. Absolutely fantastic all around.

"I enjoyed your take on the prompt. I feel like you weren't afraid to take your story into a direction completely different from what the OP had originally envisioned, and I applaud you for that. I particularly liked the strong second para, and the brilliantly convincing figure of the Devil, the misunderstood and misguided individual trying to set the world right. The irony of the piece is also sublimely put across with subtle foreshadowing all the way from the start to the story's culmination where the OP is being compared to the Devil himself.  I would also just like to point out that lol lmao haha would read again 9/10 with rice. Very meta. So wow.  The scene with the nod was, in my opinion, one of the strongest portrayals of feminism in contemporary culture. The struggle of Hitler as a transgendered lesbian is, in a way, our struggle, and I feel that you have perfectly captured the lack of alternatives that is open to us as individuals in the modern world in the very first phrase.  Gentlemen, we have one option left to us , says the Devil, and I think I would be true to say that every reader would agree - there is indeed no hope.

At the end of every game, players receive a grade which scores their performance in comparison to the whole player base in that respective champion and position combination.

"Rice. There's a reason why there's an internet meme  11/10 w /rice  It goes with anything, is healthy, is cheap, is easy to cook, and works to eat all by itself.  IMO, the instant 5 min stuff is fine, especially if you are just starting out cooking. Avoid those boil-in-a-pouch things or microwavable. Box of rice, it should say instant or  cooks in 5 mins.  Use the instructions on the box.  You need a pot with a top, a measuring cup, and water. Great place to start, you learn to measure, you learn to read instructions, you learn to use a stove.

"Marijuana. Was out with some friends and some acquaintance turned up with some newly bought weed and asked if we wanted to join in. So we did.   I was sort of excited because it's a drug I'm curious about. But except from alcohol I've done none.   So we went home to his place, got out some snacks and water. Put on a movie and he rolled us a blunt or two. Was fascinating watching him grind it up and such. And the smell was very distinct.   I haven't even smoked a regular cigarette before, because fuck that nasty shit. So there I was with a blunt in my hand ready to go at it. It went ok, some coughing but not severe.   But I burned my throat like a motherfucker. Like I had already sure and burnt throat for like a week after...  And I didn't feel much high at all honestly. I felt like my usual self but a little more prone to some giggles here and there, and like a craving for snacks. He made him and I a toast sandwich each, it was heaven. I was kind of nervous about doing it and I read that quite a few people don't really get high the first time. Sat with the stoner for like 5 hours discussing movies and classical movies and it was pretty great. My friends were sleeping of course.   So overall the environment I tried it in was good and such. The experience was decent. The aftermath with my throat fucking sucked.   6/10 would try to smoke another blunt. 8/10 with rice.",0,1431775696,AskReddit,1,0

"My favorite part about this episode was the science behind some of Thunderbird 5's operations that they put in. For example, when EOS began spinning the ring section of TB5, John was pulled to the floor because of the centrifugal force, instead of just spinning around out of control. And this effect doesn't go through the every area of the space station, since he clearly floats in the main room as we've seen in previous episodes.   Also, the fact that when I was watching it, my brother asked why didn't TB3 just grab the spinning section, and I pointed out it had to match it's speed first otherwise it would rip the station apart, and it actually happened! That was very impressive. It shows that the writers have actually thought long and hard about this stuff, and made it just as good as the original.

"I was on a dose varying 40-60mg for about two years, during which I was moving around too much to get blood work done regularly. I *hated* it, and I still hate it so much. My new rheumatologist was shocked to find out what my old one had me on.  I was an absolute emotional wreck, alternately furious and *terrified* of everything. I gained a fair bit weight and it just masked my symptoms, leading to some joint damage that would probably have otherwise been avoidable. And I was *still* in pain all the time. 0/10 do not recommend. (3/10 with rice, because I was so hungry all the time.)   Like you, I'm 24 and have been dealing with some pretty impressive joint pain for five years. Now that I'm on humira and methotrexate, my whole life is different. I have actual quality of life for the first time since I was a teenager. I do still take prednisone sometimes for flare-ups and asthma symptoms, but in muuuch lower doses.   I seriously recommend talking to your doctor about other treatment. Prednisone is absolutely not a long-term treatment, and you shouldn't expect it to keep your arthritis under control for years.",0,1431994719,Thritis,4,0

"-First off, sly fox wouldn't be played at all, compare it to any other 1 drop face hunter uses and you'd see that there's just no tempo gain, it literally a wisp that can he hit with mage hero power -mage card is better than a rare, at least epic status, for what it can potentially do. Also can you get any 1 mana spell, I really think it should just be any 1 mana mage spells, otherwise this one card will rocket tempo Mage. -druid card is pretty neat. -cunning satyr is kinda, meh, not enough discard effect for this to see play. -not sure about noble steed, because a 1/1 charge every turn seems really strong and yet not at the same time(what I'm more worried about is turn 9 noble steed, muster for battle, quarter master combo, it's like a beefed up force of nature.) maybe consider making it a 2/1 instead. -no idea how good beast caller is, but seems fine. -poison vendor is alright. -dwarven smith is insane. Dude the combos are broken, turn 4, drop this and shield block 10 armour. Turn 7 same deal with shield maiden. And early game, drop him+ armour smith=SMOrc not able to hit face. -no one really runs shadow form and the fact that it does nothing early game, and that you have to wait for turn 4 to get any value kind of defeats the purpose of a one drop.

"The nice thing about the Avatar: The Last Airbender was that it was something everyone can enjoy. It's easy to get past the  it's for kids  mentality. The problems that Aang faces are way beyond his age, and the lessons he learns are good lessons for anybody. They try their hardest to use upstanding morals and strong will to change things for the better, and there is some very serious character development going on. You can see the characters turn from these happy-go-lucky adventurers, to a close-knit team of friends with a serious mission. There's less goofing off in the later seasons, and you can see why. Even the whole first season shows how innocent Aang really is. He's just been casted into this role that he has to play, and he makes the best of it.  Honestly, it was a truly wonderful show. There's comedy, romance, suspense, and evil, all exactly where they need to be and in the right dosage. 10/10, would recommend, 11/10 with rice.",0,1432057874,anime,20,0

"Managment is incompetent, staff are disorganized and do not consistently know building policies. Elevators constantly break. Overpriced, rooms are tiny and cramped. Walls don't actually reach the ceiling, so it's impossible to not hear your roommates. Stairwells are dirty, smelly, and full of trash. Random fire alarm activations with no explanation. Trash chute regularly backs up on weekends. Laundry rooms constantly in disrepair. Frequent unit entries by maintenance for vaguely explained and generally silly seeming reasons.   But it is quite convenient to campus, obviously, and I fucking love having my own room, as compared to sharing a studio in on campus housing. Get everything in writing during interactions with the staff - literally write down what they have said, and have them sign and date it, or else you may find yourself in a bind later. The furniture is okay, and the appliances are decent. Considering the fact that it's on campus, the price isn't horrific. Yeah, you're gonna get a tiny-ass room, but you'll be right on campus.   My rent is approximately $700/month. Those moving in next year will have a slightly higher rate. Keep in mind that a PSU parking pass if you have a car will be an additional $300/term. The max is right next to the building so if you have a flex pass (approx. $215/term) you will be able to use it easily.   Overall, 4/10.   5/10 with rice, if you can get your rice cooker plugged in, thanks to the insanely annoying  child-proof  outlets that I, an adult, find impossible to use.",0,1432196754,portlandstate,4,0

"Mjolner is the highest tier rarity and not necessary for any build except  mjolner  builds. There are other, cheaper builds that don't need it or even nearly as much currency to clear super fast. It's stupidly powerful but there's no real reason to remove a chase tier unique that people can aspire to dropping or buying to play with. It's not really a staple of a bunch strong or fast clearing builds, nor do any of the top 50 usually wind up using it to hit 100 consistently. It's like owning a Ferrari. It's unrealistic to expect to own as your first car, and unrealistic to expect that a wide margin of people be able to afford a luxury like it.   It's not build enabling so much as a luxury/lucky build.   On another note, nice b8 mate, I'd r8 8/8, not even ir8.",0,1432323034,pathofexile,5,0

"Can confirm, source: I wrecked my rim and tire on a large pothole one spring. The responding Officer (I made an incident report), told me a few other cars fell victim in the past two days.  I went through the process and was denied compensation based upon them getting to the issue after I reported it.  Unfortunately you can't always fight city hall (town in my case), but I know they were alerted two days beforehand, and the document they sent me upon my FOIA request looked like a child scrawled on it. It was the required information to prove there was no work order already in place.  It was vague, terribly written, and literally that, scrawled across a full page form.

"I like Angle of Attack, their training material is extremely well done. I got the Captain's package a few years ago, kinda pricey at $79 but broken down by instruction hours, it's a good price of beer/hour ratio. I like learning about how systems work, I feel I got more details out of the AoA videos than the PMDG manuals. But then again, they have different purposes.  Groundwork is great for learning how everything works (seriously, it's more than what you ever want to know), Flightwork was very useful in how all those systems come together in a flight. Linework was kind of meh two years ago, not sure how it is now.  A few years back there was an issue of videos being accessible and downloadable for a limited time. Not sure how that is now - I grabbed all I could back then for offline viewing. Someone with a more recent experience might want to chime in.  What I liked about AoA was that everything was in one place, the cockpit flow diagrams in PDF were a fantastic resource, and the Flightwork videos filled in a lot of gaps from Youtube videos. I was sure to get high quality material, which is always a toss-up with youtubers, very few of whom know their stuff.   I just got tired of watching Youtube and have someone make an FMC programming omission, and then troubleshoot the issue in flight for ten minutes. That kind of unfamiliarity with systems  is what put me off trying to get in-depth training from Youtube, and I just didn't have the patience to watch newbie after newbie fiddle with the knobs. The very few great youtubers only had so many videos up, and of those, even fewer were training specific. I ended up getting the AoA package because I hoped it would be amateur hour no more - and it wasn't.  AoA seems to be a one person gig (or at least was back a couple of years ago), some of its decisons and the way they were implemented or communicated were a little unprofessional for my taste. That has probably evolved in recent years, and at any rate the 737 material is top notch, 10/10 with rice, would buy again.",0,1432446811,flightsim,5,0

These are features missing from Cobble, which while improved is still a horrible map in my opinion. The angles are awkward, and it's easy to fall into the  fast B or slow A  mentality as T.

"There are more people pursing physics than there are jobs for physicists, so the field is very competitive, especially in particle physics. But if you go into it with an open mind, and pick up some other marketable skills (statistics, engineering, programming, technical writing) you can still be fairly competitive in other quantitative careers. There are a few more arrogant people who think that they will be the next Feynman than in other sciences, but that usually gets beaten out of them in grad school. Also, the LHC is only one of the awesome places to work at. Granted it is the hot one right now, but there is so much more to physics than just particle physics, and a lot of very great places scattered all over the world. I'm not telling to avoid particle physics, but keep in mind that there are other exciting subfields like AMO, condensed matter, biophysics, cosmology, and so on.

"Truncated Tesseract  setup with cal 44's, 70mm 80a butterballs, venom barrels and redz bearings  Truncated Tesseract is an absurdly fun board. It's a compact downhill monster.   Pros:   * Small, at 84cm this is one of the smaller decks available, makes for a very light and nimble topmount. A great wee streamlined racing board.   * Moderate w concave, nothing too outrageous, but enough to get your feet properly dug into those comfy spots.  * Solid construction. this board can and will take a absolute hammering.   * 24.5  and 26  Wheelbase options, the smaller is great for slower speeds and techier slides, the larger for more serious downhill and racing.   * Large wheel flares for those big wheels you've been choking to try.  * Did I mention it was small?  Cons:   * Small, I'm 6'1  and have a naturally wide stance, I find unless I'm properly tucking I don't stand too comfortably on it.  * Grip wears pretty quick. Mostly over the flairs, found it got worn out after 2-3 days of sliding.  * No KT, does not a good cruising/commuting board make.   Overall I am extremely satisfied with this board. It's my main ride right now as it fits what I do perfectly.   It's compact shape and light weight make it a breeze to slide. You don't have to be aggressive to control this board with the right setup. Use the lower wheelbase option, &lt;45 degree trucks and some good 68-70mm freeride wheels for sliding and drifting with almost no effort and no bullying. You'll be sideways all weekend.  Come race day, swap back onto the larger wheelbase and stick some 75-80mm wheels on thar and watch as it turns into a fast, nimble corner hugger that's smooth and stable.   If you are a downhill fan who dabbles in sliding and drifting in between racing and bombing hills, this is a great deck for you.   gr8 sk8 r8 8/8 m8",0,1432816339,longboarding,1,0

"It's not *never.* It's just pretty common that they act like they don't enjoy it (often until they cum, then their disposition changes). You can easily find Japanese porn where she's happy. For example, Maki Hojo does rapey videos but she also does stuff where she's the initiator.  Source: I watch a lot of Japanese porn but I want them to enjoy it.  Actually though, a lot of Asian girls do this IRL, just not to the extreme that you see in porn. They like to pretend you're this big strong dude corrupting them.

"Ok - when you happen upon a thread like this - you have two options.  1st one of the many many reasons this happens - is that the particular question / thread has been repeated so many times that this one has turned into this WTF is going on type threads.   So go to /r/askreddit and enter a phrase the same or similar to the one you are looking at.  For example this movie one - there's been 100's of similar questions like it... just tweak your search till you find one that's most interesting.  The other - not so good option - is to sort by controversial - because how this hive happens - is those having fun with it - downvote to oblivion any serious answers while it's first developing.   So the serious answers will be the controversial ones.  Option one is best though...  I for some strange reason - will laugh my head off at these hive fests... I actually didn't really like the one  every account is a bot except you  one... because there wasn't enough variety in the answers.   This Paul Bart one - had the most original content - while being sickeningly obnoxious as I seem to love.  I've actually spent probably 10-15 hours of my time this past year just upvoting the insanity...to participate in my small way to the hillarity .. just on the couple that will be re-read for years like the  10/10 with rice one.  Have you read that?  It's sooooo f'n hillarious how many people are COMPLETELY confused how one of the stupidest threads in history - is #3 of all time on reddit.  I spent probably 3 hours upvoting those LOL :)",0,1432854507,AskReddit,1,0

Fry some chicken up with green curry paste (*not powder*, get some real Thai stuff from an import shop), fry up whatever vegetables you want (I recommend red peppers, onion and zucchini but just experiment honestly).
